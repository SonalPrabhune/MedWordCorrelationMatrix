35052017,A simplified procedure of nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy.,"['cervical cancer', 'gynecologic surgical procedures', 'lymph nodes', 'prognosis']",The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research,"We devised a simplified nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy that is simpler than commonly used procedures.
We retrospectively examined 16 cases of classical non-nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy (non-nerve-sparing group) and 16 cases of simplified nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy (nerve-sparing group) performed between 2019 and 2020. We examined and compared the duration of surgery, blood loss, perioperative complications, postoperative urinary function (presence or absence of urinary sensation, number of days with residual urine measurement, and frequency and duration of oral sustained release urapidil capsules and self-catheterization), and short-term prognosis between the two groups.
Compared to conventional non-nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy, the duration of surgery for nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy was significantly shorter (407 [339-555] min vs. 212 [180-356] min; p < 0.001), and blood loss was significantly less. Compared to the nerve-sparing group, the non-nerve-sparing group had more cases of oral urapidil use and a higher frequency of clean intermittent catheterization. Clean intermittent catheterization was required in two cases in the nerve-sparing group; however, it was withdrawn at 180 and 240 days. Conversely, clean intermittent catheterization was still required in three cases in the non-nerve-sparing group. There were no statistically significant differences in progression-free survival and overall survival between the two groups.
The simple nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy resulted in shorter duration of surgery and less blood loss as well as in a clear improvement in the postoperative urinary status and short-term prognosis. This technique simplifies nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy, which is commonly thought to be complicated, making it easier to understand.","The simple nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy resulted in shorter duration of surgery and less blood loss as well as in a clear improvement in the postoperative urinary status and short-term prognosis.

35051996,Reduced intensity hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for myelofibrosis in accelerated-phase.,[],Blood advances,"Accelerated-phase (AP) myelofibrosis, currently defined by circulating blasts 10-19%, usually confers very high risk for progression and poor outcome. The outcome of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for AP myelofibrosis has not been evaluated yet. We analyzed the outcome of 349 clinically and genetically annotated patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis undergoing reduced intensity transplantation, of whom 35 had AP myelofibrosis. In comparison with chronic-phase (CP, <10% blasts), median leukocyte counts were higher, more patients had constitutional symptoms, and RAS mutations were detected more frequently in the AP group. After a median follow-up of 5.9 years, estimated 5-year overall survival was 65% (95% confidence interval, 49-81%) versus 64% (95% confidence interval, 59-69%) for the CP group (P=0.91), and median overall survival was not reached. In terms of relapse-free survival, estimated 5-year outcome for the AP group was 49% (95% confidence interval, 32-67%) versus 55% (95% confidence interval, 50-61%) for the CP group (P=0.65). Estimated 5-year non-relapse mortality was 20% (95% CI, 8-33%) for the AP group versus 30% (95% confidence interval, 24-35%; P=0.25) for the CP group. In terms of relapse, 5-year incidence was 30% (95% confidence interval, 14-46%) for the AP group versus 15% (95% confidence interval, 11-19%) for the CP group (P=0.02). Results were confirmed in multivariable analysis and propensity score matching. Increase in circulating blasts was associated with increased risk for relapse, showing strongest increase in risk for ≥10% blasts.

35051977,Comparison of Intracorporeal Trapezoidal-shaped Gastroduodenostomy and Delta-shaped Anastomosis After Laparoscopic Distal Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer: A Single-center Retrospective Study.,[],"Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques","Laparoscopic/robotic distal gastrectomy (LDG/RDG) as a treatment for early gastric cancer has become increasingly and widely accepted for its minimal invasiveness and proportionate outcomes. Over the years, in addition to the LDG/RDG technique and the lymphadenectomy and gastrectomy procedures, various reconstruction methods have been developed and further improved upon. In particular, the number of minimally invasive intracorporeal anastomosis reconstruction techniques has been increasing.
The medical records of 445 patients with gastric cancer who underwent reconstruction following LDG/RDG via either trapezoidal-shaped gastroduodenostomy (TAPESTRY; n=126) or delta-shaped anastomosis (DSA; n=319) at our hospital between April 2012 and May 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Short-term surgical outcomes, including the operation time, blood loss, length of hospital stay, and complications, were compared between the 2 groups. Anastomosis-related complications, namely leakage, bleeding, stricture, and delayed gastric emptying, were monitored and graded using the Clavien-Dindo classification.
All operations were either performed or supervised by qualified surgeons. Patients' characteristics in the TAPESTRY group and the DSA group were biased in terms of the surgical approach, but they were well-balanced after propensity score matching. Overall anastomosis-related complications (Clavien-Dindo grade II or above) within 30 days after surgery in the TAPESTRY group were comparable with those in the DSA group, either all patients (1.5% vs. 5.0%, P=0.115) or after propensity score-matching analysis (2.1% vs. 6.5%, P=0.134). There were no records of reoperation or mortality during hospitalization in either group.

35051970,Clinical Review of Smartphone Applications in Parkinson Disease.,[],The neurologist,"Parkinson disease (PD) is the second leading neurodegenerative disease worldwide. Important advances in monitoring and treatment have been made in recent years. This article reviews literature on utility of smartphone applications in monitoring PD symptoms that may ultimately facilitate improved patient care, and on movement modulation as a potential therapeutic.
Novel mobile phone applications can provide one-time and/or continuous data to monitor PD motor symptoms in person or remotely, that may support precise therapeutic adjustments and management decisions. Apps have also been developed for medication management and treatment.
Smartphone applications provide a wide array of platforms allowing for meaningful short-term and long-term data collection and are also being tested for intervention. However, the variability of the applications and the need to translate complicated sensor data may hinder immediate clinical applicability. Future studies should involve stake-holders early in the design process to promote usability and streamline the interface between patients, clinicians, and PD apps.",,,,"Copyright © Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We aimed to assess the risk of EC unfavorable histological prognostic factors in patients with adenomyosis.
All studies with data about histological prognostic factors of EC in patients with and without adenomyosis were included. Relative risk for each unfavorable histological prognostic factor of EC, such as nonendometrioid histotype, FIGO grade 3, FIGO stage II-IV, lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), and deep myometrial invasion, was calculated in patients with adenomyosis compared to patients without adenomyosis.

35051937,Tailored molecular imaging of pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma: which tracer and when.,[],Neuroendocrinology,"Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma are rare neoplasms that fall within the category of neuroendocrine tumors. In the last decade, their diagnostic algorithm has been modified to include the evaluation of molecular pathways, genotype and biochemical phenotype, in order to correctly interpret anatomical and functional imaging results and tailor the best therapeutic choices to patients. More specifically, the identification of germline mutations has led to a three-way cluster classification: pseudo-hypoxic cluster, cluster of kinase receptor signaling and protein translation pathways, and cluster of Wnt-altered pathway. In this context, functional imaging gained a crucial role in the management of these patients in agreement with the ever-growing concept of personalized medicine. In this paper we provide an overview of three specific molecular pathways targeted by positron-emitting tracers to image pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas: catecholamine metabolism, somatostatin receptors and glucose uptake. Finally, we recommend different flow charts for use in the selection of tracers for specific clinical scenarios, based on sporadic/inherited tumor and known/unknown mutation status.",,,,"S.

35051923,Oral Abundance of Actinomyces spp. in Breast Cancer Patients.,[],Oncology,"Pathophysiology of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is still unclear and disease development is associated with adverse reaction of bisphosphonates and denosumab, and Actinomyces spp. as well. In this study we evaluated the abundance of Actinomyces spp. in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy compared to healthy controls.
Oropharyngeal samples were collected from treatment naive early-stage breast cancer patients, who were scheduled for standard of care therapy (eight samples throughout chemotherapy, one prior to radiotherapy and one after a year of start), as well as from healthy controls at matched timepoints. We quantified Actinomyces spp. in the samples with a highly sensitive and specific qPCR.
Twenty-one patients and 16 healthy subjects were enrolled. 48% of patients suffered from ER-positive/PR-positive or -negative/HER2-negative disease, 38% were HER2-positive and 14% were triple-negative. Comparison of Actinomyces spp. loads in cancer patients and healthy controls did not reveal significant difference. Fluctuations on bacterial quantity was observed in both groups over time. Tumor receptor status or different chemotherapy schemes of patients were not correlated with a particular pattern on abundance of Actinomyces spp.
We suggest that Actinomyces spp. are not the initiative factor in MRONJ development. These bacteria are not altered in abundance during chemotherapy, but they behave opportunistic when there is a bone disruption in the oropharynx in the first place caused by antiresorptive drugs or dental trauma and proliferate in their new niche. Thus, Actinomyces spp. play a latter role in MRONJ development, rather than a primary causative one.",,,"Twenty-one patients and 16 healthy subjects were enrolled. 48% of patients suffered from ER-positive/PR-positive or -negative/HER2-negative disease, 38% were HER2-positive and 14% were triple-negative.

The proportion of ambiguously clustered pairs was calculated based on consensus clustering to evaluate the validity of the selected features. In addition, Radscore was calculated for the training and test cohorts. For expression level of PD-L1 above 1%, prediction models that included radiomic features from the intratumoral region and a combination of radiomic features from intratumoral and peritumoral regions yielded an AUC of 0.83 and 0.87 and 0.64 and 0.74 in the training and test cohorts, respectively. In contrast, the models above 50% prediction yielded an AUC of 0.80, 0.97, and 0.74, 0.83, respectively. The selected features were divided into two subgroups based on PD-L1 expression levels ≥ 50% or ≥ 1%. Radscore was statistically higher for subgroup one than subgroup two when radiomic features for intratumoral and peritumoral regions were combined. We constructed a predictive model for PD-L1 expression level using CT images. The model using a combination of intratumoral and peritumoral radiomic features had a higher accuracy than the model with only intratumoral radiomic features.",,,,© 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.,10.1088/2057-1976/ac4d43,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Shiinoki', 'firstname': 'Takehiro', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Yamaguchi University, Minamikogushi 1-1-1, Ube, Yamaguchi, 7558505, JAPAN.'}, {'lastname': 'Fujimoto', 'firstname': 'Koya', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Yamaguchi University, Minamikogushi 1-1-1, Ube, Yamaguchi, 7558505, JAPAN.'}, {'lastname': 'Kawazoe', 'firstname': 'Yusuke', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Yamaguchi University, Minamikogushi 1-1-1, Ube, Yamaguchi, 7558505, JAPAN.'}, {'lastname': 'Yuasa', 'firstname': 'Yuki', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Yamaguchi University, Minamikogushi 1-1-1, Ube, Yamaguchi, 7558505, JAPAN.'}, {'lastname': 'Kajima', 'firstname': 'Miki', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Yamaguchi University, Minamikogushi 1-1-1, Ube, Yamaguchi, 7558505, JAPAN.'}, {'lastname': 'Manabe', 'firstname': 'Yuki', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Yamaguchi University, Minamikogushi 1-1-1, Ube, Yamaguchi, 7558505, JAPAN.'}, {'lastname': 'Ono', 'firstname': 'Taiki', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Yamaguchi University, Minamikogushi 1-1-1, Ube, Yamaguchi, 7558505, JAPAN.'}, {'lastname': 'Hirano', 'firstname': 'Tsunahiko', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory Medicine and Infectious Disease, Yamaguchi University, Minamikogushi 1-1-1, Ube, Yamaguchi, 7558505, JAPAN.'}, {'lastname': 'Matsunaga', 'firstname': 'Kazuto', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Respiratory Medicine and Infectious Disease, Yamaguchi University, Minamikogushi 1-1-1, Ube, Yamaguchi, 7558505, JAPAN.'}, {'lastname': 'Tanaka', 'firstname': 'Hidekazu', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Yamaguchi University, Minamikogushi 1-1-1, Ube, Yamaguchi, 7558505, JAPAN.'}]"

35051898,No difference in radiologic outcomes for natalizumab patients treated with extended interval dosing compared with standard interval dosing: Real-world evidence from MS PATHS.,[],Multiple sclerosis and related disorders,"Extended interval dosing (EID; average dosing interval approximately every 6 weeks) of natalizumab is associated with significantly lower risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy than standard interval dosing (SID; every 4 weeks) in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). Real-world studies, though limited, suggest that natalizumab effectiveness is generally maintained in patients who switch to EID after initiation of stable treatment with SID. MS PATHS (Multiple Sclerosis Partners Advancing Technology and Health Solutions) is a collaborative, multicenter learning health system that generates real-world clinical and MRI data using highly standardized acquisition protocols. We compared MRI outcomes in MS PATHS patients treated with natalizumab EID versus SID. We also compared MRI outcomes in patients treated with natalizumab (EID and/or SID) versus injectable MS platform therapy.
Natalizumab infusion data from the TOUCH Prescribing Program database and MS PATHS MRI assessment data from seven US sites as of July 23, 2020, were used to identify patients with relapsing-remitting MS who had received natalizumab EID or SID in the interval between two MRI scans (an MRI segment). Patients who received injectable platform MS therapy between two MRI scans were also identified. MRI data were used to determine the incidence rate and odds of developing new or enlarging T2 lesions, annualized percentage change in T2 lesion volume (T2LV), and annualized percentage change in brain parenchymal fraction (BPF). MRI outcomes were compared for 1) natalizumab EID treatment versus natalizumab SID treatment, 2) natalizumab treatment (EID + SID) versus platform therapy, and 3) natalizumab EID versus platform therapy. Propensity score-based weighting or matching were used to balance covariates at the start of MRI segments for all comparisons.
The MRI outcomes observed with natalizumab EID treatment did not differ significantly from those observed with natalizumab SID treatment. The odds ratio for any new or enlarging T2 lesion was 1.07 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.93, 1.24; p = 0.355), and the rate ratio (95% CI) for new or enlarging T2 lesions was 1.62 (0.93, 2.82; p = 0.090). Differences (95% CI) between EID and SID patients in mean annualized percentage change in T2LV and BPF were 1.56% (-3.77%, 6.90%; p = 0.566) and -0.11% (-0.25%, -0.10%; p = 0.096), respectively. Conversely, when MRI outcomes in natalizumab and platform therapy patients were compared, there were significant differences favoring natalizumab in all assessments: the odds of any new or enlarging T2 lesion (odds ratio: 0.69 [95% CI: 0.64, 0.75]; p<0.001), the incidence rate of new or enlarging T2 lesions (rate ratio: 0.47 [95% CI: 0.37, 0.61]; p<0.001), annualized percentage change (decrease) in T2LV (difference: -3.68% [95% CI: -7.06%, -0.30%]; p = 0.033), and annualized percentage change (increase) in BPF (difference: 0.22% [95% CI: 0.16%, 0.29%]; p<0.001). Results of the subgroup comparison of natalizumab EID patients with platform therapy patients were similar to those of the overall-natalizumab-group-versus-platform-therapy comparison.
The results indicate that natalizumab EID and SID provide comparable real-world effectiveness on quantitative MRI metrics. These data further demonstrate that natalizumab EID can provide superior real-world effectiveness to injectable platform therapy on quantitative MRI metrics.",,,"The MRI outcomes observed with natalizumab EID treatment did not differ significantly from those observed with natalizumab SID treatment.

We aim to report the results of our cancer screening strategy and to ascertain the reliability of using PET/CT to identify cancer-associated myositis (CAM) in a large cohort of patients with myositis from a single center over 10 years.
This retrospective observational study included all patients diagnosed with any type of myositis except for inclusion body myositis. Cancer screening strategy was individualized according to clinical and serological data, including PET/CT as the main test to detect occult cancer (OC). Procedures derived from a positive PET/CT were registered. Qualitative data expressed as percentages, and quantitative data as the median with the interquartile range were analyzed. A ROC curve was used to estimate the reliability of PET/CT for CAM diagnosis.
Seventy-seven out of 131 patients underwent a PET/CT for OC screening. The performance of the PET/CT in patients with myositis at disease onset yielded an area under the curve ROC of 0.87 (0.73-0.97) for CAM diagnosis. Invasive procedures in 7 (9%) patients without a final diagnosis of cancer did not cause derived complications. Patients not evaluated for OC did not develop cancer after a median follow-up of 3.3 years (1.7-6.7).

Specifically, germline alterations in DNA repair not only increase cancer risk but are associated with treatment response and clinical outcomes. The therapeutic landscape of cancer has rapidly evolved with the FDA approval of therapies that specifically target DNA repair vulnerabilities. The clinical success of synthetic lethality between BRCA deficiency and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition has been truly revolutionary. Defective mismatch repair has been validated as a predictor of response to immune checkpoint blockade associated with durable responses and long-term benefit in many cancer patients. Advances in next generation sequencing technologies and their decreasing cost have supported increased genetic profiling of tumors coupled with germline testing of cancer risk genes in patients. The clinical adoption of panel testing for germline assessment in high-risk individuals has generated a plethora of genetic data, particularly on DNA repair genes. Here, we highlight the therapeutic relevance of germline aberrations in DNA repair to identify patients eligible for precision treatments such as PARP inhibitors (PARPis), immune checkpoint blockade, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and combined treatment.

In 2015, a multidisciplinary lung nodule management program, Nodule Net, was implemented to increase the timely follow-up rate. In this study, we sought to evaluate the effectiveness of the program.
2398 chest CT reports were reviewed for the presence of a lung nodule. Baseline demographics, nodule characteristics, and follow-up recommendations were collected. For reports that did not include structured recommendations, Fleischner Society guidelines were applied if appropriate. The rate of follow-up imaging was recorded and compared with historical rates.
Lung nodules were reported on 1367 (57%) of scans. Of the 632 participants with recommendations for follow-up, the Nodule Net nurse navigator was notified on 523 (83%).

However, plant extracts can harbor a mixture of bioactive molecules that promote divergent phenotypes and potentially have confounding effects in bioassays. Even with further purification and identification, target deconvolution can be challenging. Corynoline and acetylcorynoline, are phytochemicals that were previously isolated through a screen for compounds able to induce mitotic arrest and polyploidy in oncogene expressing retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Here, we shed light on the mechanism by which these phytochemicals can attack human cancer cells. Mitotic arrest was coincident to the induction of centrosome amplification and declustering, causing multi-polar spindle formation. Corynoline was demonstrated to have true centrosome declustering activity in a model where A549 cells were chemically induced to have more than a regular complement of centrosomes. Corynoline could inhibit the centrosome clustering required for pseudo-bipolar spindle formation in these cells. The activity of AURKB, but not AURKA or polo-like kinase 4, was diminished by corynoline. It only partially inhibited AURKB, so it may be a partial antagonist or corynoline may work upstream on an unknown regulator of AURKB activity or localization. Nonetheless, corynoline and acetylcorynoline inhibited the viability of a variety of human cancer derived cell lines. These phytochemicals could serve as prototypes for a next-generation analog with improved potency, selectivity or in vivo bioavailability. Such an analog could be useful as a non-toxic component of combination therapies where inhibiting the chromosomal passenger protein complex is desired.",,,,Copyright © 2022.

A better understanding of the molecular determinants involved in chemoresistance is critical for precision medicine and therapeutic progress. Caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2) is a master regulator of intestinal identity and acts as tumor suppressor in the colon. Here, using a translational approach, we examined the role of CDX2 in CRC chemoresistance. Unexpectedly, we discovered that the prognosis value of CDX2 for disease-free survival of patients affected with CRC is lost upon chemotherapy and that CDX2 expression enhances resistance of colon cancer cells towards 5-FU. At the molecular level, we found that CDX2 expression correlates with higher levels of genes regulating the bioavailability of 5-FU through efflux (ABCC11) and catabolism (DPYD) in patients affected with CRC and CRC cell lines.

35051856,Impact of feature harmonization on radiogenomics analysis: Prediction of EGFR and KRAS mutations from non-small cell lung cancer PET/CT images.,"['Artificial intelligence', 'Computed tomography', 'Harmonization', 'Imaging genomics', 'Non-small cell lung cancer', 'Positron emission tomography']",Computers in biology and medicine,"To investigate the impact of harmonization on the performance of CT, PET, and fused PET/CT radiomic features toward the prediction of mutations status, for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS) genes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.
Radiomic features were extracted from tumors delineated on CT, PET, and wavelet fused PET/CT images obtained from 136 histologically proven NSCLC patients. Univariate and multivariate predictive models were developed using radiomic features before and after ComBat harmonization to predict EGFR and KRAS mutation statuses. Multivariate models were built using minimum redundancy maximum relevance feature selection and random forest classifier. We utilized 70/30% splitting patient datasets for training/testing, respectively, and repeated the procedure 10 times. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were used to assess model performance. The performance of the models (univariate and multivariate), before and after ComBat harmonization was compared using statistical analyses.
While the performance of most features in univariate modeling was significantly improved for EGFR prediction, most features did not show any significant difference in performance after harmonization in KRAS prediction. Average AUCs of all multivariate predictive models for both EGFR and KRAS were significantly improved (q-value < 0.05) following ComBat harmonization. The mean ranges of AUCs increased following harmonization from 0.87-0.90 to 0.92-0.94 for EGFR, and from 0.85-0.90 to 0.91-0.94 for KRAS. The highest performance was achieved by harmonized F_R0.66_W0.75 model with AUC of 0.94, and 0.93 for EGFR and KRAS, respectively.
Our results demonstrated that regarding univariate modelling, while ComBat harmonization had generally a better impact on features for EGFR compared to KRAS status prediction, its effect is feature-dependent. Hence, no systematic effect was observed. Regarding the multivariate models, ComBat harmonization significantly improved the performance of all radiomics models toward more successful prediction of EGFR and KRAS mutation statuses in lung cancer patients. Thus, by eliminating the batch effect in multi-centric radiomic feature sets, harmonization is a promising tool for developing robust and reproducible radiomics using vast and variant datasets.","Our results demonstrated that regarding univariate modelling, while ComBat harmonization had generally a better impact on features for EGFR compared to KRAS status prediction, its effect is feature-dependent.

Conventional end-point methods are insufficient for understanding the temporal response in cell secretion process, which is often highly dynamic. Furthermore, cellular heterogeneity makes it essential to analyze secretory proteins from single cells. To uncover individual cellular activities and the underlying kinetics, new technologies are needed for real-time analysis of the secretomes of many cells at single-cell resolution. This study reports a high-throughput biosensing microarray platform, which is capable of label-free and real-time secretome monitoring from a large number of living single cells using a biochip integrating ultrasensitive nanoplasmonic substrate and microwell compartments having volumes of ∼0.4 nL. Precise synchronization of image acquisition and microscope stage movement of the developed optical platform enables spectroscopic analysis with high temporal and spectral resolution. In addition, our system allows simultaneous optical imaging of cells to track morphology changes for a comprehensive understanding of cellular behavior. We demonstrated the platform performance by detecting interleukin-2 secretion from hundreds of single lymphoma cells in real-time over many hours. Significantly, the analysis of the secretion kinetics allows us to study cellular response to the stimulations in a statistical way. The new platform is a promising tool for the characterization of single-cell functionalities given its versatility, throughput and label-free configuration.",,,,Copyright © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

A JAK2V617F mutation has been shown to be a risk factor for thrombosis. The implication of other risk factors alongside a mutation allele burden needs to be clarified (Trifa et al., 2018; Borowczyk et al., 2015).
Our aim was to investigate the role of the JAK2 mutation allele burden in the risk of cardiovascular events (CVE) and/or venous thrombosis (VTE) in a cohort of patients with confirmed MPN, as well as in patients without confirmed MPN.
We restrospectively included all consecutive patients who were positive for JAK2V617F seen by our unit between December 2008 and September 2016. Inclusion criteria were a positive test for the JAK2V617F mutation, with at least 1% allele burden, with or without confirmed MPN.
We included 239 patients of median age 71 years [60-81], followed-up for a median of 82.8 months [41.08-146.88]. For JAK2V617F positive patients having an allele burden superior to 50% the cumulative incidence of VTE was significantly higher than for those with an allele burden inferior to 50% (HR 3.11 95% CI [1.10-8.76] p = 0.031). The cumulative incidence of VTE was also higher in patients with obesity (HR 4.58 95% CI [1.33-15.8] p = 0.016). There was no significant association between a JAK2V617F allele burden and arterial thrombosis (manifesting as CVE). Previous VTE was also associated with a higher cumulative incidence of recurrence during follow-up HR 3.22 95% CI [1.17-8.81] p = 0.0231.

We conducted a three-year retrospective analysis of accessible records of adult cancer patients admitted with oncological emergencies.
Patients with subtle presentations had longer wait times than patients with severe presentations in all ED timeliness indicators. On average, subtle presentations were significantly associated with 47.5 min increase in time to be seen, 33 min increase in time to be treated, 42 min increase in time to decide on admission and prolonged ED stay by 24 min (p < 0.05).

However, the association between MEOX2 and breast carcinoma has not been addressed. This research focused on investigating the possible relevance of MEOX2 in breast carcinoma. Initial expression analysis by TCGA data uncovered low levels of MEOX2 in breast carcinoma. We then confirmed that MEOX2 was poorly expressed in clinical tumor specimens of breast carcinoma by real-time quantitative PCR and immunoblotting assays. Moreover, low levels of MEOX2 in breast carcinoma patients were found to be correlated with reduced overall survival. A series of cellular function assays showed that the forced expression of MEOX2 had anticancer effects, including the inhibition of cell proliferation, the induction of G0-G1 phase arrest, the restraint of metastatic potential, and the enhancement of chemosensitivity. Further analysis revealed that MEOX2 negatively modulated the phosphatidyl-inositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) pathways. Reactivation of AKT by a chemical activator reversed MEOX2-mediated anticancer effects. An in vivo xenograft assay validated the anticancer function of MEOX2 in breast carcinoma. Taken together, these data show that MEOX2 exerts a cancer-inhibiting role in breast carcinoma by affecting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK1/2 pathways. This work suggests MEOX2 as a new contributor for breast carcinoma progression, which may be a candidate target for anticancer therapy development.",,,,Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

35051766,Arsenic exposure and biomarkers for oxidative stress and telomere length in indigenous populations in Bolivia.,"['8-oxo-dG', 'Andes', 'Cancer', 'HNE', 'MtDNA', 'Toxicity']",Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,"Women living in the Bolivian Andes are environmentally exposed to arsenic, yet there is scarce information about arsenic-related effects in this region. Several biomarkers for telomere length and oxidative stress (mitochondrial DNA copy number, mtDNAcn; 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine, 8-oxo-dG; and 4-hydroxy nonenal mercapturic acid, 4-HNE-MA) have been previously linked to arsenic, and some of which are prospective biomarkers for cancer risk.
To evaluate associations between arsenic exposure and telomere length, mtDNAcn, 8-oxo-dG, and 4-HNE-MA in Bolivians. Arsenic exposure was hypothesized to be positively associated with all four toxicity biomarkers, particularly in individuals with a less efficient arsenic metabolism.
The study encompassed 193 indigenous women. Arsenic exposure was assessed in urine as the sum of inorganic arsenic metabolite concentrations (U-As) measured by HPLC-HG-ICP-MS, and in whole blood as total arsenic (B-As) measured by ICP-MS. Efficiency of arsenic metabolism was evaluated by a polymorphism (rs3740393) in the main arsenic methylating gene AS3MT measured by TaqMan allelic discrimination, and by the relative fractions of urinary inorganic arsenic metabolites. Telomere length and mtDNAcn were determined in peripheral blood leukocytes by quantitative PCR, and urinary 8-oxo-dG and 4-HNE-MA by LC-MS/MS.
U-As and B-As were associated with longer telomeres and higher mtDNAcn, particularly in women with a less efficient arsenic metabolism. Urinary 8-oxo-dG and 4-HNE-MA were positively associated with U-As, but only 4-HNE-MA was associated with B-As. Arsenic metabolism efficiency did not have a clear effect on the concentrations of either of these biomarkers.
Bolivian women showed indications of arsenic toxicity, measured by four different biomarkers. Telomere length, mtDNAcn, and 4-HNE-MA were positively associated with both U-As and B-As. The association of arsenic exposure with telomere length and mtDNAcn was only present in Bolivian women with a less efficient metabolism. These findings call for additional efforts to evaluate and reduce arsenic exposure in Bolivia.","Bolivian women showed indications of arsenic toxicity, measured by four different biomarkers.

35051754,Reducing number of target lesions for RECIST1.1 to predict survivals in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer undergoing anti-PD1/PD-L1 monotherapy.,"['Immunotherapy', 'Non-small-cell lung cancer', 'Predictor', 'RECIST version 1.1', 'Target lesion']","Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)","The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 provides conventional and standardized response assessment for multiple solid tumors. We investigated the smallest number of target lesions that can be measured without compromising response categorization and survival prediction in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) undergoing anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy.
125 aNSCLC patients with at least two measurable lesions undergoing PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment were retrospectively studied. Tumor measurements allowing up to two lesions per organ and five lesions in total were reviewed. Inter-individual agreement and κ values for inter-method concordance on response status were evaluated based on up to five target lesions versus the largest one through four lesions. C-index was calculated to evaluate the prognostic accuracy of response categorization based on the selected number of target lesions for predicting overall survival (OS). Cox regression analysis was conducted for survival analysis.
The highly consistent response assignment (99.2%) could be obtained when measuring the largest two lesions versus up to five lesions. Using the largest two through four lesions produced κ values of 0.986, 1.000 and 1.000 for response assessment, values significantly higher than those obtained when measuring the largest single lesion (κ = 0.850). C-index for overall survival (OS) was similar when assessing the largest one through five lesions, ranging from 0.646 to 0.654. Cox regression analyses showed that radiological response significantly predicted OS, irrespective of the number of target lesions selected.
Reducing the number of target lesions does not affect OS prediction in aNSCLC patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.

In order to maintain the anticancer activity of drugs, disulfide bond was incorporated as releasable group based on tumor microenviroment. After design, synthesis and structure characterization of title compounds, various biological evaluation and cancer cell imaging analysis were carried out. The results indicated that these title diagnosis and treatment integration bi-functional molecules exhibited comparable potency with that of corresponding parent drug. Meanwhile, these agents afforded good performance in cell imaging and could be used to differentiate cancer cells from normal ovarian cells in real time. Further optimization of these bi-functional molecules is ongoing to improve the potency and precision and will be reported in due course.

One such practice becoming more prevalent across Western countries is the clinical use of Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) data. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork carried out in a Danish setting among nurses managing PRO-based breast cancer follow-up, we examine how clinical decisions are made on the basis of PRO-data and what this requires from the nurses. By applying the concept of recontextualisation work as an analytical perspective, we shed light on the efforts of nurses when mobilising complementary information about patients in order to recontextualise the otherwise decontextualised data, thereby giving data practical value in clinical decision-making. Recontextualisation work, we show, is shaped by organisational structure, available resources, and nurses' professional capacity.

35051729,Computational pathology aids derivation of microRNA biomarker signals from Cytosponge samples.,"['Artificial intelligence', ""Barrett's oesophagus"", 'Computerized image analysis', 'Dysplasia', 'Oesophageal cancer', 'Screening']",EBioMedicine,"Non-endoscopic cell collection devices combined with biomarkers can detect Barrett's intestinal metaplasia and early oesophageal cancer. However, assays performed on multi-cellular samples lose information about the cell source of the biomarker signal. This cross-sectional study examines whether a bespoke artificial intelligence-based computational pathology tool could ascertain the cellular origin of microRNA biomarkers, to inform interpretation of the disease pathology, and confirm biomarker validity.
The microRNA expression profiles of 110 targets were assessed with a custom multiplexed panel in a cohort of 117 individuals with reflux that took a Cytosponge test. A computational pathology tool quantified the amount of columnar epithelium present in pathology slides, and results were correlated with microRNA signals. An independent cohort of 139 Cytosponges, each from an individual patient, was used to validate the findings via qPCR.
Seventeen microRNAs are upregulated in BE compared to healthy squamous epithelia, of which 13 remain upregulated in dysplasia. A pathway enrichment analysis confirmed association to neoplastic and cell cycle regulation processes. Ten microRNAs positively correlated with columnar epithelium content, with miRNA-192-5p and -194-5p accurately detecting the presence of gastric cells (AUC 0.97 and 0.95). In contrast, miR-196a-5p is confirmed as a specific BE marker.
Computational pathology tools aid accurate cellular attribution of molecular signals. This innovative design with multiplex microRNA coupled with artificial intelligence has led to discovery of a quality control metric suitable for large scale application of the Cytosponge. Similar approaches could aid optimal interpretation of biomarkers for clinical use.

This trial assessed a maintenance strategy conditioned by response to cisplatin-gemcitabine (CG) with G continuation for patients with OR or switch to pemetrexed (P) for patients with SD as compared with a control arm based on the Paramount regimen.
Eligibility criteria: age 18-70 years, ECOG PS 0-1, untreated stage IV NS-NSCLC without EGFR or ALK alteration, ineligibility to bevacizumab. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either CG (4 cycles) followed by G maintenance in case of OR followed by P at progression, or switch to P for patients with SD, or 4 cycles of CP followed by P (control arm). Primary endpoint: overall Survival.
Between 2012 and 2016, 932 patients were randomized (CG: 467, CP: 465) with well-balanced characteristics. 257 patients (56.7%) in the CG arm received maintenance (G: 142, P: 113) versus 277 patients (59.7%) in the CP arm. Median number of maintenance cycles was 5 for G and P (CG induction) and 4 for P (CP induction).

Post-surgical motor and language deficits, including seizures, weakness, aphasia, and dysarthria have been well-documented in patients undergoing these operations, particularly on eloquent cortical regions. However, it is not known whether awake versus asleep cortical mapping contributes to differences in postoperative neurological deficits.
A comprehensive review of the literature utilizing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines was completed for articles describing cortical mapping for tumor resection. We critically assessed all articles published in the last 20 years describing complications of patients who had undergone either awake or asleep motor mapping for eloquent brain tumor resection. Studies were analyzed for number of patients, follow-up duration, rates of transient and permanent motor and sensory deficits in the perioperative period, and outcomes at one-month follow-up.
Thirty-one studies met inclusion criteria, 24 of which reported long-term post-operative follow-up data. Follow-up among selected studies ranged from one month to four years. Nine of the 31 studies directly compared the postoperative outcomes of awake versus asleep mapping. The rate of transient deficits among patients who underwent awake and asleep mapping was 31.6% and 32.7%, respectively. The rate of permanent deficits was 10.8% in awake mapping patients and 12.7% in asleep mapping patients. Qualitative analysis showed that motor and sensory complications occurred at similar rates.

This qualitative study assessed reactions to a potential menthol cigarette ban among people who smoke menthol cigarettes.
As part of a laboratory study examining menthol flavor regulations, we conducted follow-up interviews with participants who smoke menthol cigarettes (N = 35). We explored the following topics: (1) menthol cigarette risk perceptions; (2) knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of menthol cigarette regulations; and (3) anticipated behavior if menthol cigarettes were banned. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, double-coded, and analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis.
Many participants thought menthol cigarettes carried more health risks than non-menthol cigarettes. Some participants said regulators wanted to ban menthol cigarettes because they appeal to youth. Others thought a ban would be good for public health because fewer people, particularly youth, would smoke. Several voiced skepticism about banning only menthol cigarettes rather than all cigarettes. Most said they would use other products, including electronic cigarettes or non-menthol cigarettes, but many also thought a menthol ban could motivate them or others to quit smoking.
Banning menthol cigarettes could lead some people who smoke menthol cigarettes to switch to potentially less harmful products, like e-cigarettes, or quit smoking, which would likely benefit public health; however, others may simply transition to non-menthol cigarettes.

35051691,Diffusion-weighted imaging-gadolinium enhancement mismatch sign in diffuse midline glioma.,[],European journal of radiology,"Diffuse midline glioma (DMG), H3 K27M-mutant including diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a disease with dismal prognosis. We focused on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and gadolinium enhanced T1WI (Gd), especially high intensity on DWI at non-enhanced lesion, i.e. DWI-Gd mismatch sign, to establish as an imaging biomarker of DMG patients.
Our institutional review board approved this retrospective study. Twenty-one patients diagnosed as DMG including DIPG at our institution between 2007 and 2020 were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent local radiotherapy of 54 Gy/30 fractions. We studied the relationship between imaging features including DWI-Gd mismatch sign and prognosis.
DWI-Gd mismatch sign was found in 9 out of 21 DMG patients. Among different imaging characteristics, existence of high intensity on DWI (P = 0.0014), gadolinium enhancement (P = 0.00071) were the significant poor prognostic markers in DMG, which were consistent with the previous reports about DIPG. In our results, positive DWI-Gd mismatch sign was statistically strongest poor prognostic imaging biomarker, and patients with positive DWI-Gd mismatch sign had shorter OS compared to those with negative mismatch sign (9.9 months vs 18.6 months, P = 0.00062). DWI/Gd mismatch sign and intratumoral bleeding were more common in DMG at thalamus compared to DMG at pons/DIPG (P = 0.046 and P = 0.0017, respectively).

In our present study, significant up-regulation of Actin-like protein 8 (ACTL8) in OSCC patients was observed by bioinformatics analysis with RNA sequencing data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The results of Chi-square test revealed that there was a significant correlation between ACTL8 expression and tumor status (T1 + T2/T3+T4) (P = 0.004). Survival analysis indicated a negative correlation between ACTL8 overexpression and prognosis in OSCC (P = 3.984e-02). An ACTL8 knockdown experiment was conducted to evaluate the function of ACTL8 on OSCC cell biological behaviors. The results revealed that knockdown of ACTL8 significantly inhibited the growth and mobility, arrested cell cycle and promoted apoptosis of TCA-83 and CAL27 cells. Moreover, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and western blots demonstrated that activation of cell cycle signaling pathway was inhibited by knockdown of ACTL8, as we observed the down-regulation of 4 key proteins (CDK1, cyclin E1, cyclin B2 and c-Myc) in this pathway.

We examine age exclusion across phases and funder types and demonstrate the extent of these exclusions over all interventional studies that commenced enrollment on or after January 2010 to Oct 2021.
Cancer trials have the lowest percentage of age capped enrollment, with 22.18%, 24.13%, and 32.77% of the studies listing an upper age limit in Phases 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

Laparoscopic radical trachelectomy with the ""cuff-sleeve"" suture method for cervicovaginal reconstruction.
Twenty-five patients successfully underwent the laparoscopic radical trachelectomy with the ""cuff-sleeve"" suture method for cervicovaginal reconstruction, and no intraoperative complications occurred or conversion to laparotomy was needed. For all patients, approximately 80% of the cervical length was removed. Surgical radicality and negative surgical margins were also confirmed. During a median follow-up time of 29 months (range 8-48 months), no severe postoperative complications were observed. No cervical stenosis or secondary abnormal menstruation was reported. After the removal of the uterine stent 6 months after surgery, the neocervix length was about 14mm (range 10-19mm) and almost all the neocervixes were restored closely to the original anatomy. Four of 8 patients attempting actively to conceive were successful, and the cervical length of these pregnant patients was greater than or equal to 15mm in all but one measurement at different gestational age.

35051651,A gene-diet interaction controlling relative intake of dietary carbohydrates and fats.,"['AgRP', 'Dietary preference', 'cholesterol', 'simvastatin']",Molecular metabolism,"Preference for dietary fat vs. carbohydrate varies markedly across free-living individuals. It is recognized that food choice is under genetic and physiological regulation, and that the central melanocortin system is involved. However, how genetic and dietary factors interact to regulate relative macronutrient intake is not well understood.
We investigated how the choice for food rich in carbohydrate vs. fat is influenced by dietary cholesterol availability and agouti-related protein (AGRP), the orexigenic component of the central melanocortin system. We assessed how macronutrient intake and different metabolic parameters correlate with plasma AGRP in a cohort of obese humans. We also examined how both dietary cholesterol levels and inhibiting de novo cholesterol synthesis affect carbohydrate and fat intake in mice, and how dietary cholesterol deficiency during the postnatal period impacts macronutrient intake patterns in adulthood.
In obese human subjects, plasma levels of AGRP correlated inversely with consumption of carbohydrates over fats. Moreover, AgRP-deficient mice preferred to consume more calories from carbohydrates than fats, more so when each diet lacked cholesterol. Intriguingly, inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis (simvastatin) promoted carbohydrate intake at the expense of fat without altering total caloric consumption, an effect that was remarkably absent in AgRP-deficient mice. Finally, feeding lactating C57BL/6 dams and pups a cholesterol-free diet prior to weaning led the offspring to prefer fats over carbohydrates as adults, indicating that altered cholesterol metabolism early in life programs adaptive changes to macronutrient intake.
Together, our study illustrates a specific gene-diet-drug interaction in modulating food choice.","Together, our study illustrates a specific gene-diet-drug interaction in modulating food choice.",,"In obese human subjects, plasma levels of AGRP correlated inversely with consumption of carbohydrates over fats.

However, the signaling molecules governing this progression remain to be defined. Based on microarray analysis of genes expressed in OL and OSCC samples, we discovered that LncRNA IFITM4P was highly expressed in OSCC and ectopic expression or knockdown of IFITM4P resulted in increased or decreased cell proliferation in vitro and in xenografted tumors respectively. Mechanistically, in the cytoplasm IFITM4P acted as a scaffold to facilitate recruiting SASH1 to bind and phosphorylate TAK1 (Thr187), and in turn to increase the phosphorylation of NF-κB (Ser536) and concomitant induction of PD-L1 expression, resulting in activation of an immunosuppressive program that allows OL cells to escape anti-cancer immunity in cytoplasm. In nucleus, IFITM4P reduced Pten transcription by enhancing the binding of KDM5A to the Pten promoter, thereby upregulating PD-L1 in OL cells. Moreover, mice bearing tumors with high IFITM4P expression had notable therapeutic sensitivity to PD-1 mAb treatment. Collectively, these data demonstrate that IFITM4P may serve as a new therapeutic target in blockage of oral carcinogenesis, and PD-1 mAb can be an efective reagent to treat OSCC.",,,,Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

SASP factors promote TIS cancer cells to re-enter the growth cycle with stemness characteristics, resulting in chemo-resistance and disease relapse. Herein, we showed that the immunotherapeutic HCW9218, comprising TGF-β receptor II and IL-15/IL-15 receptor α domains, enhanced metabolic and cytotoxic activities of immune cells and reduced TIS tumor cells in vivo to improve the efficacy of docetaxel and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel against B16F10 melanoma and SW1990 pancreatic tumors, respectively. Mechanistically, HCW9218 treatment reduced the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and enhanced immune-cell infiltration and cytotoxicity in the tumors to eliminate TIS cancer cells. Immuno-depletion analysis suggested that HCW9218-activated natural killer cells played a pivotal role in TIS cancer cell removal. HCW9218 treatment following docetaxel chemotherapy further enhanced efficacy of tumor antigen-specific and anti-PDL-1 antibodies in B16F10 tumor-bearing mice. We also show that HCW9218 treatment decreased TIS cells and lowered SASP factors in off-target tissues caused by chemotherapy of tumor-bearing mice.

Given that TDO and IDO1 activities are directly proportional to their heme contents, it is important to understand their heme delivery and insertion processes. Early studies established that TDO and IDO1 heme levels are sub-saturating in vivo and subject to change but did not identify the cellular mechanisms that provide their heme or enable dynamic changes in their heme contents. We investigated the potential involvement of GAPDH and chaperone Hsp90, based on our previous studies linking these proteins to intracellular heme allocation. We studied heme delivery and insertion into IDO1 and TDO expressed in both normal and heme-deficient HEK293T cells and into IDO1 naturally expressed in HeLa cells in response to IFN-γ, and also investigated the interactions of TDO and IDO1 with GAPDH and Hsp90 in cells and among their purified forms. We found that GAPDH delivered both mitochondrially-generated and exogenous heme to apo-IDO1 and apo-TDO in cells, potentially through a direct interaction with either enzyme. In contrast, we found Hsp90 interacted with apo-IDO1 but not with apo-TDO, and was only needed to drive heme insertion into apo-IDO1. By uncovering the cellular processes that allocate heme to IDO1 and TDO, our study provides new insight on how their activities and l-kynurenine production may be controlled in health and disease.",,,,Copyright © 2022.

The roots of P. suffruticosa has been used in traditional medicine in various diseases including cancer and cardiovascular, female genital, and inflammatory diseases.
Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) pathologically account for 90% of all head and neck cancers. However, effective targeted therapies for HNSCCs are insufficient and the prognosis is very poor, especially in patients with metastatic HNSCCs. To overcome the current limitations of available therapies for HNSCCs, pathological approaches using natural compounds are attracting attention. Our study aimed to demonstrate the anti-cancer effects of paeoniflorigenone (Paeo, 98.9% purity) isolated from the root bark of P. suffruticosa.
Our scientific methodology was performed as follows: cytotoxicity, morphological changes, and apototic DNA fragmentation were analyzed using MTT, light microscopy, and TUNEL assays. Protein expression, apoptosis, necroptosis, and autophagy were analyzed using Western blot and immunofluorescence assays. Cell migration and invasion were analyzed using wound healing and Boyden chamber assays.
We demonstrated that Paeo significantly reduced cell proliferation and cell division, leading to caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death in human YD-10B HNSCC cells. This result was associated with PI3K/AKT/mTOR/p70S6K signaling in these cells. In addition, we investigated other programmed cell death mechanisms associated with apoptosis and found that Paeo inhibited necroptosis via dephosphorylation of key necroptotic proteins (RIP and MLKL), whereas Paeo induced autophagy via increased LC3I/II expression and autophagosome formation in human YD-10B HNSCC cells. The anti-metastatic effects of Paeo significantly suppressed cell migration and invasion in human YD-10B HNSCC cells.
Overall, our results demonstrated that the bioactive compound, Paeo, exhibited anti-cancer bioactivities in human YD-10B HNSCC cells, suggesting that Paeo may be an attractive pathological approach for patients with human HNSCCs.","Overall, our results demonstrated that the bioactive compound, Paeo, exhibited anti-cancer bioactivities in human YD-10B HNSCC cells, suggesting that Paeo may be an attractive pathological approach for patients with human HNSCCs.",,"We demonstrated that Paeo significantly reduced cell proliferation and cell division, leading to caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death in human YD-10B HNSCC cells.

These receptors can adopt both agonist and antagonist binding conformations that switch the receptor signal on or off to the downstream production of cytokines. In this study, we examined the effect of simple isomeric substitutions to the C2-butyl group of two imidazoquinoline agonists and evaluated the activity of these analogs using both TLR7 and TLR8 reporter cells and cytokine induction assays. Results are presented showing the C2-isobutyl and C2-cyclopropylmethyl isomers are both mixed TLR7/8 competitive antagonists of the parent agonist [4-Amino-1-(4-(aminomethyl)benzyl)-2-butyl-7-methoxycarbonyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline], indicating the conformation of the dimeric receptor complex is highly sensitive to steric perturbations to the ligand binding pocket. This observation is consistent with prior work demonstrating TLR7 and TLR8 activity is directly correlated to C2-alkyl substitutions that project into a hydrophobic pocket at the dimer interface of the receptor. The close structural relationship of the agonist/antagonist pairs identified here highlights the importance of this pocket in tipping the balance between the agonist and antagonist binding states of the receptor which may have significant ramifications to the design of imidazoquinoline-based immunomodulatory agents.",,,,Copyright © 2022.

Some proteins involved in cancer-related redox processes, such as peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1), showed higher frequency and abundance in mass spectrometry detection. Our results suggest that cytotoxicity of PES and its derivatives may be related to attack of protein thiols and cellular GSH resulting in breakdown of cellular redox homeostasis. This study provides a powerful new tool compound within the PES class of bioactive compounds and gives insight into the working mechanisms of PES and its derivatives.",,,,Copyright © 2022.

35051534,A novel promoter-associated non-coding small RNA paGLI1 recruits FUS/P65 to transactivate GLI1 gene expression and promotes infiltrating glioma progression.,"['Brain tumor', 'Hedgehog signalling pathway', 'Short RNA', 'Transcriptional activation']",Cancer letters,"Glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1) is a core component of the Hedgehog (HH) signalling pathway and is a transcription activator of numerous oncogenes, such as SOX9, VEGFA, BCL2, and CDK2. The complex regulation of GLI1 involves numerous pathways and molecules, including HH-dependent and independent, epigenetic and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Here, we report the discovery, characterization and function of a novel sense promoter-associated ncRNA, paGLI1 that is overexpressed in infiltrating glioma. We show that paGLI1 promotes GLI1 gene transcription through binding to and recruitment of the transcription factor complex FUS/P65 by interacting with paGLI1 DNA sequence. This interaction facilitates FUS/P65 binding to the GLI1 promoter to activate GLI1 transcription and hence its downstream oncogenes, which results in enhancement of glioma cell proliferation and invasiveness. Importantly, over-expression of paGLI1 is a significant unfavorable prognosticator for both disease-specific and progression-free survival in glioma patients, with relative risks being 2.932 (95% confidence interval: 1.280 to 6.713) (P < 0.05) and 2.284 (95% confidence interval: 1.051 to 4.966) (P < 0.05), respectively.

In this study, we aimed to explore whether exosome-mediated angiogenesis blocking could improve the chemotherapy sensitivity via vascular normalization. Exosomes were armed with RGD on the surface by fusing Lamp2b. Candidate miRNAs related to tumor angiogenesis was detected by qRT-PCR. RGD-modified exosomes were loaded with miRNAs via electroporation. The therapeutic effects of the exosomes on angiogenesis, vascular normalization, and chemotherapy sensitivity were systemically analyzed in the xenograft model. RGD-modified exosomes were relatively enriched in the tumor mass, both the tumor cell and the endothelial cells. Among the miRNA candidates, miR-484 was found down-regulated in both the cancer cells and the angiogenic endothelial cells. In vivo xenograft model experiment revealed that injection of RGD-modified exosomes loaded with miR-484 induced vessel normalization and in turn sensitized the cancer cells to chemotherapy induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, miR-484 simultaneously inhibited the expression of VEGF-A from the cancer cells and the corresponding receptors in the endothelial cells. Targeted delivery of miR-484 via RGD-modified exosomes improves the vascular normalization, sensitizes the cancer to chemotherapy, and prolongs the survival time of tumor-bearing mice after chemotherapy, opening an avenue for the clinical management of chemotherapy resistance.",,,,Copyright © 2022.

Findings from recently developed models of PCa metastatic spread are discussed, focusing mainly on the role of the TME (mainly matrix and fibroblast cell types), at distinct stages: premetastatic niche orchestrated by the primary tumor towards the metastatic site and bone metastasis. We report evidence of premetastatic niche formation, such as the mechanisms of distant site conditioning by extracellular vesicles, chemokines and other tumor-derived mechanisms, including altered cancer cell-ECM interactions. Furthermore, evidence supporting the similarities of stroma alterations among the primary PCa and bone metastasis, and contribution of TME to androgen deprivation therapy resistance are also discussed.

35051531,Disrupting PHF8-TOPBP1 connection elicits a breast tumor-specific vulnerability to chemotherapeutics.,[],Cancer letters,"The DNA damage response (DDR) pathway generally protects against genome instability, and defects in DDR have been exploited therapeutically in cancer treatment. We have reported that histone demethylase PHF8 demethylates TOPBP1 K118 mono-methylation (K118me1) to drive the activation of ATR kinase, one of the master regulators of replication stress. However, whether dysregulation of this physiological signalling is involved in tumorigenesis remains unknown. Here, we showed PHF8-promoted TOPBP1 demethylation is clinically associated with breast tumorigenesis and patient survival. Mammary gland tumors from Phf8 knockout mice grow slowly and exhibit higher level of K118me1, lower ATR activity, and increased chromosomal instability. Importantly, we found that disruption of PHF8-TOPBP1 axis suppresses breast tumorigenesis and creates a breast tumor-specific vulnerability to PARP inhibitor (PARPi) and platinum drug. CRISPR/Cas9 mutation modelling of the deleted or truncated mutation of PHF8 in clinical tumor samples demonstrated breast tumor cells expressing the mimetic variants are more vulnerable to PARPi. Together, our study supports the pursuit of PHF8-TOPBP1 signalling pathway as promising avenues for targeted therapies of PHF8-TOPBP1 proficient tumors, and provides proof-of-concept evidence for loss-of-function of PHF8 as a therapeutic indicator of PARPis.",,,,Copyright © 2022.

Reviews on cancer,"Cancer arises from genetic alterations that invariably contribute to dysregulated transcriptional programs. These dysregulated programs establish and maintain specific cancer cell states, leading to an intensive dependence on a set of certain regulators of gene expression. The CDK7 functions as the core of transcription, and governs RNA polymerase II and the downstream oncogenes expression in cancers. CDK7 Inhibition leads to reduced recruitment of super-enhancers-driven oncogenic transcription factors, and the depression of these associated oncogenes expression, which indicates the dependence of transcriptional addiction of cancers on CDK7. Given that specified oncoproteins of sarcomas commonly function at oncogenic transcription, targeting CDK7-denpendent transcriptional addiction may be of guiding significance for the treatment of sarcomas. In this review, we summarize the advances in mechanism of targeted CDK7-dependent transcriptional addiction and discuss the path ahead to potential application discovery in bone and soft tissue sarcomas, providing theoretical considerations for bio-orthogonal therapeutic strategies.",,,,Copyright © 2021.

35051527,Find the path of least resistance: Adaptive therapy to delay treatment failure and improve outcomes.,[],Biochimica et biophysica acta. Reviews on cancer,"Cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted therapies help people with advanced cancers, but for most, treatment fails. Cancer heterogeneity is one cause of treatment failure, but also suggests an opportunity to improve outcomes; reconceptualising cancer therapy as an ecological problem offers the strategy of adaptive therapy. If an agent is active against a patient's cancer, instead of traditional continuous dosing at the maximum tolerated dose until treatment failure, the patient and their oncologist may instead choose to pause treatment as soon as the cancer responds. When tumour burden increases, the cancer is rechallenged with the same agent in hope of delivering another response, ideally before symptoms occur or quality-of-life is impacted. These 'loops' of 'pause/restart' allows an active treatment to be used strategically, to delay the development of evolutionary selection within the cancer, delaying the onset of treatment resistance, controlling the cancer for longer. Modelling predicts patients can navigate several 'loops', potentially increasing the utility of an active treatment by multiples, and early trials suggest at least doubling of progression-free survival. In this narrative review we confront how cancer heterogeneity limits treatment effectiveness, re-examine cancer as an ecological problem, review the data supporting adaptive therapy and outline the challenges and opportunities faced in clinical practice to implement this evolutionary concept. In an era where multiple novel active anti-neoplastic agents are being used with ancient inflexibile maximum tolerated dose for maximum duration approaches, adaptive dosing offers a personalised, n = 1 approach to cancer therapy selection.",,,,Copyright © 2021.

However, PTT efficacy is still not satisfactory due to the existence of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and poorly targeted delivery. Herein, the design of a nanosystem with improved delivery efficacy for anticancer treatment employing the synergetic effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-driven chemodynamic therapy (CDT) to inactivated HSPs with photothermal-hyperthermia was therefore achieved through the development of pH-targeting glycol chitosan/iron oxide enclosed core polypyrrole nanoclusters (GCPI NCs). The designed NCs effectively accumulated toward cancer cells due to their acidic microenvironment, initiating ROS generation via Fenton reaction at the outset and performing site-specific near infrared (NIR)-photothermal effect. A comprehensive analysis of both surface and bulk material properties of the CDT/PTT NCs as well as biointerface properties were ascertained via numerous surface specific analytical techniques by bringing together heightened accumulation of CDT/PTT NCs, which can significantly eradicate cancer cells thus minimizing the side effects of conventional chemotherapies. All of these attributes act in synergy over the cancer cells succeeding in fashioning NC's able to act as competent agents in the MRI-monitored enhanced CDT/PTT synergistic therapy.

Among the antiviral molecules currently tested in clinical trials, the farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI) Lonafarnib inhibits the prenylation of the large delta antigen (L-HDAg), blocking virus assembly. Given the importance of L-HDAg in the virus life cycle, we hypothesized that Lonafarnib treatment may have side effects on virus replication. Here, we setup an innovative method for the quantification of HDV RNA allowing the independent quantification of edited and non-edited versions of the HDV genome upon infection. We demonstrated that FTI treatment of HBV/HDV co-infected dHepaRG or primary human hepatocytes leads to an accumulation of intracellular HDV RNAs and a marked increase in the levels of edited RNAs non only within the infected cells but also in the viral particles that are produced. Interestingly, these viral particles were less infectious, probably due to an enrichment in edited genomes that are packaged, leading to unproductive infection given the absence of S-HDAg synthesis after viral entry. Taken together, we setup an innovative quantification method allowing the investigation of RNA editing during HDV infection in a simple, fast, clinically-relevant assay and demonstrated for the first time the dual antiviral activity of FTI on HDV infection.",,,,Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

35051467,Long-term exposure to ambient air pollutants and hearing loss in Korean adults.,"['Air pollution', 'CO', 'Hearing loss', 'Long-term exposure', 'NO(2)', 'PM(10)', 'SO(2)']",The Science of the total environment,"Hearing loss is the most prevalent sensory deficit globally, and its prevalence has been growing at a rapid pace, mainly due to the aging population. Although there is plentiful evidence that exposure to air pollutants contributes to oxidative stress and free radical formation in the inner ear is linked to hearing impairment, there is little awareness of the contribution of air pollution to hearing loss.
We aimed to evaluate the associations between long-term exposures to air pollution and hearing loss in Korean adults, while controlling for sociodemographic and clinical factors and occupational, recreational, and firearm noise exposures.
We analyzed data from 15,051 adults in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey V (2010-2012). Ambient air pollutant concentrations for participant residing in the administrative division and local/town units were collected for current-to-3 years prior to the audiometric examination. Pure-tone average (PTA) of hearing thresholds at speech- (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz) and high-frequency (3, 4, and 6 kHz) were computed, and hearing loss was defined as a PTA >25 dB in either ear.

Here, we demonstrate the ability of the salicylic acid (SA)-inducible MarR repressor protein from Escherichia coli to regulate target gene expression in a human T lymphocyte cell line. Two lentiviral vectors, one encoding an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter cassette and the other a repressor cassette, were sequentially transduced into Jurkat cells, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate stable Jurkat progeny. As a result, EGFP expression was repressed by MarR and was inducible upon the addition of SA (~1.3 fold). This represents the first example of functional expression of bacterial MarR in mammalian cells, and opens the possibility for further development of regulated, SA-tunable gene expression system for T-cells.",,,,Copyright © 2022.

In this study, mice received lipopolysaccharide (LPS) intraperitoneal injection with or without EcN administration to construct a mouse model of endotoxemia. Clinical scores, intestinal permeability, inflammatory cytokines and histopathological analysis of four main organs from different groups were assessed. The expression of tight junction proteins and activation of RhoA/ROCK2/MLC signaling were examined using western blotting. The localization of tight junction proteins was examined by immunofluorescence. Caco-2 monolayers with or without TLR-4 knockdown were incubated with EcN or TNF-α/IFN-γ and the monolayer barrier function was assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and FITC-dextran 4000 Da (FD-4) flux. The expression of tight junction proteins and activation of RhoA/ROCK2/MLC signaling were examined by western blotting. The localization of tight junction proteins was examined by immunofluorescence.
We found that EcN downregulated the RhoA/ROCK2/MLC signaling pathway to preserve barrier function and alleviated systemic inflammation in mouse model. And EcN also protected barrier function of Caco-2 monolayers by inhibiting the activation of RhoA/ROCK2/MLC signaling via TLR-4.
The results indicated that EcN protected the intestinal barrier function in endotoxemia through inhibiting the activation of RhoA/ROCK2/MLC signaling via TLR-4.",,,,Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

35051385,Androgen deprivation therapy use and duration with definitive radiotherapy for localised prostate cancer: an individual patient data meta-analysis.,[],The Lancet. Oncology,"Randomised trials have investigated various androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) intensification strategies in men receiving radiotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer. This individual patient data meta-analysis of relevant randomised trials aimed to quantify the benefit of these interventions in aggregate and in clinically relevant subgroups.
For this meta-analysis, we performed a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, Embase, trial registries, the Web of Science, Scopus, and conference proceedings to identify trials with results published in English between Jan 1, 1962, and Dec 30, 2020. Multicentre randomised trials were eligible if they evaluated the use or prolongation of ADT (or both) in men with localised prostate cancer receiving definitive radiotherapy, reported or collected distant metastasis and survival data, and used ADT for a protocol-defined finite duration. The Meta-Analysis of Randomized trials in Cancer of the Prostate (MARCAP) Consortium was accessed to obtain individual patient data from randomised trials. The primary outcome was metastasis-free survival. Hazard ratios (HRs) were obtained through stratified Cox models for ADT use (radiotherapy alone vs radiotherapy plus ADT), neoadjuvant ADT extension (ie, extension of total ADT duration in the neoadjuvant setting from 3-4 months to 6-9 months), and adjuvant ADT prolongation (ie, prolongation of total ADT duration in the adjuvant setting from 4-6 months to 18-36 months). Formal interaction tests between interventions and metastasis-free survival were done for prespecified subgroups defined by age, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group, and radiotherapy dose. This meta-analysis is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021236855.
Our search returned 12 eligible trials that provided individual patient data (10 853 patients) with a median follow-up of 11·4 years (IQR 9·0-15·0). The addition of ADT to radiotherapy significantly improved metastasis-free survival (HR 0·83 [95% CI 0·77-0·89], p<0·0001), as did adjuvant ADT prolongation (0·84 [0·78-0·91], p<0·0001), but neoadjuvant ADT extension did not (0·95 [0·83-1·09], p=0·50). Treatment effects were similar irrespective of radiotherapy dose, patient age, or NCCN risk group.
Our findings provide the strongest level of evidence so far to the magnitude of the benefit of ADT treatment intensification with radiotherapy for men with localised prostate cancer. Adding ADT and prolonging the portion of ADT that follows radiotherapy is associated with improved metastasis-free survival in men, regardless of risk group, age, and radiotherapy dose delivered; however, the magnitude of the benefit could vary and shared decision making with patients is recommended.

35051383,Endpoints for extraintestinal manifestations in inflammatory bowel disease trials: the EXTRA consensus from the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.,[],The lancet. Gastroenterology & hepatology,"Extraintestinal manifestations occur frequently in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and remain a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. The aim of the Endpoints for Extraintestinal Manifestations in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Trials (EXTRA) initiative was to achieve international expert consensus on how to assess these manifestations in IBD trials. A systematic literature review was done to identify methods to diagnose extraintestinal manifestations in patients with IBD and measure treatment outcomes. A consensus meeting involving a panel of 41 attendees, including gastroenterologists and referral specialists, was held on March 31, 2021, as part of an International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases initiative. The panel agreed that a specialist's expertise is needed to confirm the diagnosis of extraintestinal manifestations before the inclusion of a patient in IBD trials, except for axial spondyloarthritis, for which typical symptoms and MRI can be sufficient. Easy-to-measure endpoints were identified to assess the response of extraintestinal manifestations to treatment without needing specialist involvement. For uveitis, peripheral spondyloarthritis, and arthralgia, endpoint measurements need specialist expertise. The timing of endpoint measurements was discussed for individual extraintestinal manifestations. The EXTRA consensus proposes guidelines on how to thoroughly evaluate extraintestinal manifestations within IBD trials, and recommends that these guidelines are implemented in future trials to enable prospective assessment of these manifestations and comparison between studies.",,,,Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Evidence-based practice project.
A Chicago neighborhood in Cook County, Illinois, where there are increased rates of diabetes, heart disease, cancer, stroke, hypertension, obesity, preterm birth, and violent crime.
Female residents of the community, ages 19 to 45 years; 12 participants registered for the program, and 11 participants completed the entire 2-month program.
The BE WISE Lifestyle Intervention, a culturally tailored, gender-specific behavior change curriculum, was used for this project. An interprofessional team was used to enhance participant experience, and neighborhood collaborations were established to create sustainability of efforts. Pre- and postintervention measures of diet, physical activity, social support, and knowledge acquisition were used to evaluate outcomes.
Improvement was noted for knowledge in most of the content areas, as well as for dietary and physical activity behaviors. All participants rated the program highly and responded positively to the social support experienced in the group.
Culturally tailored lifestyle interventions can be effective in improving knowledge and encouraging behavior change, especially when delivered in group settings to enhance social support. Community-level collaborations enhance interventions by providing local support and resources for participants. Because behavior change takes time, follow-up at the 6-month and 1-year intervals is recommended to determine longer-term outcomes.","Culturally tailored lifestyle interventions can be effective in improving knowledge and encouraging behavior change, especially when delivered in group settings to enhance social support.

BAP1 is a tumor suppressor whose germline loss-of-function variants predispose to cancer. To our knowledge, there are very rare examples of different germline variants in the same gene causing either a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) or a tumor predisposition syndrome. Here, we report a series of 11 de novo germline heterozygous missense BAP1 variants associated with a rare syndromic NDD. Functional analysis showed that most of the variants cannot rescue the consequences of BAP1 inactivation, suggesting a loss-of-function mechanism. In T cells isolated from two affected children, H2A deubiquitination was impaired. In matching peripheral blood mononuclear cells, histone H3 K27 acetylation ChIP-seq indicated that these BAP1 variants induced genome-wide chromatin state alterations, with enrichment for regulatory regions surrounding genes of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Altogether, these results define a clinical syndrome caused by rare germline missense BAP1 variants that alter chromatin remodeling through abnormal histone ubiquitination and lead to transcriptional dysregulation of developmental genes.",,,,Copyright © 2021 American Society of Human Genetics.

Research has identified potential metabolic targets, including fatty acid metabolism, in TNBC. The absence of effective target therapies for TNBC led to exploration of the role of fatty acid synthetase (FASN) as a potential target for TNBC therapy. Here, we analyzed the expression of FASN, a representative lipid metabolism-related protein, and investigated the association between FASN expression and Ki-67 and the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) biomarkers in TNBC.
Immunohistochemical expression of FASN was analyzed in 166 patients with TNBC. For analytical purposes, patients with 0-1+ FASN staining were grouped as low-grade FASN and patients with 2+-3+ FASN staining as high-grade FASN.
FASN expression was observed in 47.1% of TNBC patients. Low and high expression of FASN was identified in 75.9% and 24.1%, respectively, and no statistically significant difference was found in T category, N category, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, or recurrence rate between the low and high-FASN expression groups. Ki-67 proliferation level was significantly different between the low and high-FASN expression groups. FASN expression was significantly related to Ki-67 as the level increased. There was no significant difference in PD-L1 positivity between the low- and high-FASN expression groups.
We identified FASN expression in 166 TNBC patients. The Ki-67 proliferation index was positively correlated with FASN level, indicating higher proliferation activity as FASN increases.

We report a case of a 26-year-old female who presented with low back pain and constipation which persisted despite supportive measures. Imaging revealed multiple liver lesions and enlarged retroperitoneal nodes. Tumor markers including AFP were markedly elevated. On biopsy, samples from the liver revealed infiltrating glands lined by columnar-type epithelium with mostly eosinophilic granular to focally clear cytoplasm. By immunohistochemistry, the tumor showed immunoreactivity with AFP, hepatocyte antigen, GPC3, SALL4, CDX2, SATB2, and cytokeratin 20. A colonoscopy performed subsequently revealed a mass in the sigmoid colon and biopsy of this mass revealed a similar histology as that seen in the liver. A diagnosis of CAED was made, following the results of gene expression profiling by the tumor with next-generation sequencing which identified pathogenic variants in MUTYH, TP53, and KDM6A genes and therefore supported its colonic origin.

We aimed to identify circular RNA (circRNA) with predictive and therapeutic value for recurrent HCC.
Tissue samples from recurrent and non-recurrent HCC patients were subjected to circRNA sequencing and transcriptome sequencing. circKCNN2 was identified through multi-omics analyses. The effects of circKCNN2 on HCC were evaluated in cells, animals, database of The Cancer Genome Atlas, and a cohort with 130 HCC patients. circRNA precipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, RNA pull-down, luciferase assay, and cell experiments were applied to evaluate the interaction of circKCNN2 with miRNAs and proteins. The association between circKCNN2 and the therapeutic effect of lenvatinib was investigated in HCC cell lines and HCC tissue-derived organoids.
The expression of circKCNN2 was downregulated in HCC tissues and predicted a favorable overall survival and recurrence-free survival. The expression of circKCNN2 was positively correlated with the parental gene, potassium calcium-activated channel subfamily N member (KCNN2). Nuclear transcription factor Y subunit alpha (NFYA) was proven to inhibit the promoter activity of KCNN2, downregulate the expression of KCNN2 and circKCNN2, and predict an unfavorable recurrence-free survival. Ectopic expression of circKCNN2 inhibited HCC cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and tumor formation in a mouse model. miR-520c-3p sponged by circKCNN2 could reverse the inhibitory effect of circKCNN2 on HCC cells and down-regulate the expression of methyl-DNA-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2). The intratumoral expression of MBD2 predicted a favorable recurrence-free survival. circKCNN2 down-regulated the expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4), which can be reversed by miR-520c-3p and knockdown of MBD2. Lenvatinib inhibited the expression of FGFR4 and upregulated the expression of circKCNN2 and MBD2. Ectopic expression of circKCNN2 in HCC cells enhanced the therapeutic effect of lenvatinib.

35051295,The Invasive Potential of Hepatoma Cells Induced by Radiotherapy is Related to the Activation of Stellate Cells and Could be Inhibited by EGCG Through the TLR4 Signaling Pathway.,[],Radiation research,"Post-radiotherapy recurrence and metastasis of liver cancer were thought to arise from the invasion and metastasis of residual hepatocellular carcinoma cells, but it has now been shown to be closely related to the increased metastatic potential of residual liver cancer cells mediated by radiotherapy. The changes of liver microenvironment after radiotherapy also provide a favorable condition for promoting the metastatic potential of hepatocellular carcinoma. Studies have shown that radiation-induced activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is one of the main changes in the microenvironment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, we hypothesized that activated HSCs are involved in regulating the metastatic capacity of residual cancer cells after radiotherapy. The present study observed that 48 h co-culture of three human hepatoma cell lines (MHCC97-L, Hep-3B, LM3) with a irradiated human HSC line (LX-2) in a transwell chamber could significantly improve the invasion of the human hepatoma cells; and the culture supernatant of activated HSCs could also enhance the invasion of the hepatoma cells. In contrast, co-culture with irradiated hepatoma cells enhanced the invasion of LX-2 cells. In vitro, irradiation enhanced the activation phenotype and the toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway of LX-2 cells or primary mouse HSCs, which upregulated intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1), laminin receptor (67 LR), Interleukin- 6 (IL-6), and CX3C chemokine ligand 1 (CX3CL1) and downregulated toll-interacting proteins. The compound (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) inhibited signal transduction of activated TLR4 and radiation-induced invasion of LX-2 cells by binding to 67 LR. These observations indicated that the enhancement of the metastatic potential of hepatoma cells after irradiation was relevant to the activation of HSCs, and the activation of TLR4 signaling pathway was involved in this process, which was inhibited by EGCG. Our results will help enhance the therapeutic efficacy of liver cancer stereotactic body radiation therapy to prevent and decrease the risks of post-radiotherapy recurrence and metastasis.",,,,©2022 by Radiation Research Society.,10.1667/RADE-21-00129.1,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Shen', 'firstname': 'Xiaoyun', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Key Laboratory of Endoscopic Technology Research, Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 310016, P.R.

35051275,Associations of RBC and Serum Folate Concentrations with Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia and High-Risk Human Papillomavirus Genotypes in Female Chinese Adults.,"['cervical cancer', 'cervical intraepithelial neoplasia', 'folate', 'human papillomavirus', 'interaction']",The Journal of nutrition,"Although folate status is associated with cervical carcinogenesis, it is not clear whether folate deficiency is associated with risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) progression and infection with high-risk human-papillomavirus (hrHPV).
To evaluate the associations of RBC and serum folate concentrations with prevalence of CIN grades and hrHPV infection, their interactions with prevalence of CIN grades, and RBC folate with the risk of CIN1 progressing to CIN2.
Using data from the Shanxi CIN cohort of 2304 female Chinese adults, we used logistic-regression model to estimate ORs and prevalence ratios (PRs) of RBC and serum folate concentrations with prevalence of CIN grades and hrHPV infection. Categoric and spline analyses were used to evaluate the dose-response relations. We estimated the association of RBC folate with risk of CIN1 progressing to CIN2 in the nested case-control cohort.
An inverse association was observed between increased RBC folate concentration and the odds of all CIN grades [quartile 1 (Q1) compared with Q4: OR: 2.28; 95% CI: 1.77, 2.93; Ptrend < 0.001]. Significant interaction of RBC folate and hrHPV infection was observed for prevalence of CIN2 or above (Pinteraction < 0.01). No associations were found between RBC and serum folate with PRs of hrHPV in each CIN grade. Over a median follow-up of 21.0 mo, RBC folate was associated with increased risk of CIN1 progressing to CIN2 (Q1 compared with Q4: OR: 3.86; 95% CI: 1.01, 14.76).
Our study indicates that RBC folate concentration is associated with prevalence of CIN grades and CIN1 progression in female Chinese adults. Maintenance of normal folate status is important for reducing the risk of CIN and its progression in women with or without hrHPV infection.",,,"An inverse association was observed between increased RBC folate concentration and the odds of all CIN grades [quartile 1 (Q1) compared with Q4: OR: 2.28; 95% CI: 1.77, 2.93; Ptrend < 0.001].

Here, we propose that the overall pattern of DNA methylation established in the early embryo serves as a sophisticated mechanism for maintaining a genome-wide network of gene regulatory elements in an inaccessible chromatin structure throughout the body. As development progresses, programmed demethylation in each cell type then provides the specificity for maintaining select elements in an open structure. This allows these regulatory elements to interact with a large range of transcription factors and thereby regulate the gene expression profiles that define cell identity.",,,,© 2022.

35051263,Expression Profiles of Immune Cells after Propofol or Sevoflurane Anesthesia for Colorectal Cancer Surgery: A Prospective Double-blind Randomized Trial.,[],Anesthesiology,"The antitumor effects of natural killer cells, helper T cells, and cytotoxic T cells after cancer surgery were reported previously. This study hypothesized that propofol-based anesthesia would have fewer harmful effects on immune cells than volatile anesthetics-based anesthesia during colorectal cancer surgery.
In total, 153 patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery were randomized and included in the analysis. The primary outcome was the fraction of circulating natural killer cells over time in the propofol and sevoflurane groups. The fractions of circulating natural killer, type 1, type 17 helper T cells, and cytotoxic T cells were investigated. The fractions of CD39 and CD73 expressions on circulating regulatory T cells were investigated, along with the proportions of circulating neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes.
The fraction of circulating natural killer cells was not significantly different between the propofol and sevoflurane groups until 24 h postoperatively (20.4 ± 13.4% vs. 20.8 ± 11.3%, 17.9 ± 12.7% vs. 20.7 ± 11.9%, and 18.6 ± 11.6% vs. 21.3 ± 10.8% before anesthesia and after 1 and 24 h after anesthesia, respectively; difference [95% CI], -0.3 [-4.3 to 3.6], -2.8 [-6.8 to 1.1], and -2.6 [-6.2 to 1.0]; P = 0.863, P = 0.136, and P = 0.151 before anesthesia and after 1 and 24 h, respectively). The fractions of circulating type 1 and type 17 helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, and CD39+ and CD73+ circulating regulatory T cells were not significantly different between the two groups.

35051231,Immunopeptidomic analysis of influenza A virus infected human tissues identifies internal proteins as a rich source of HLA ligands.,[],PLoS pathogens,"CD8+ and CD4+ T cells provide cell-mediated cross-protection against multiple influenza strains by recognising epitopes bound as peptides to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and -II molecules respectively. Two challenges in identifying the immunodominant epitopes needed to generate a universal T cell influenza vaccine are: A lack of cell models susceptible to influenza infection which present population-prevalent HLA allotypes, and an absence of a reliable in-vitro method of identifying class II HLA peptides. Here we present a mass spectrometry-based proteomics strategy for identifying viral peptides derived from the A/H3N2/X31 and A/H3N2/Wisconsin/67/2005 strains of influenza. We compared the HLA-I and -II immunopeptidomes presented by ex-vivo influenza challenged human lung tissues. We then compared these with directly infected immortalised macrophage-like cell line (THP1) and primary dendritic cells fed apoptotic influenza-infected respiratory epithelial cells. In each of the three experimental conditions we identified novel influenza class I and II HLA peptides with motifs specific for the host allotype. Ex-vivo infected lung tissues yielded few class-II HLA peptides despite significant numbers of alveolar macrophages, including directly infected ones, present within the tissues. THP1 cells presented HLA-I viral peptides derived predominantly from internal proteins. Primary dendritic cells presented predominantly viral envelope-derived HLA class II peptides following phagocytosis of apoptotic infected cells. The most frequent viral source protein for HLA-I and -II was matrix 1 protein (M1). This work confirms that internal influenza proteins, particularly M1, are a rich source of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of two ex-vivo fully human infection models which enable direct HLA-I and -II immunopeptide identification without significant viral tropism limitations. Application of this epitope discovery strategy in a clinical setting will provide more certainty in rational vaccine design against influenza and other emergent viruses.",,,,,10.1371/journal.ppat.1009894,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Nicholas', 'firstname': 'Ben', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Proteomic Research, Biological Sciences and Institute for Life Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.\nCentre for Cancer Immunology and Institute for Life Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Bailey', 'firstname': 'Alistair', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Proteomic Research, Biological Sciences and Institute for Life Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.\nCentre for Cancer Immunology and Institute for Life Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Staples', 'firstname': 'Karl J', 'initials': 'KJ', 'affiliation': 'Clinical and Experimental Sciences, Sir Henry Wellcome Laboratories, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Wilkinson', 'firstname': 'Tom', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Clinical and Experimental Sciences, Sir Henry Wellcome Laboratories, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.\nNIHR Southampton BRC, UHS NHS FT, Southampton, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Elliott', 'firstname': 'Tim', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Cancer Immunology and Institute for Life Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Skipp', 'firstname': 'Paul', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Centre for Proteomic Research, Biological Sciences and Institute for Life Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.'}]"

Griffithsin (GRFT) is a non-ARV lectin with potent anti-HIV activity. GRFT's preclinical safety, lack of systemic absorption after vaginal administration in animal studies, and lack of cross-resistance with existing ARV drugs prompted its development for topical HIV PrEP. We investigated safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity of PC-6500 (0.1% GRFT in a carrageenan (CG) gel) in healthy women after vaginal administration. This randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, double-blind first-in-human phase 1 study enrolled healthy, HIV-negative, non-pregnant women aged 24-45 years. In the open label period, all participants (n = 7) received single dose of PC-6500. In the randomized period, participants (n = 13) were instructed to self-administer 14 doses of PC-6500 or its matching CG placebo (PC-535) once daily for 14 days. The primary outcomes were safety and PK after single dose, and then after 14 days of dosing. Exploratory outcomes were GRFT concentrations in cervicovaginal fluids, PD, inflammatory mediators and gene expression in ectocervical biopsies. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02875119. No significant adverse events were recorded in clinical or laboratory results or histopathological evaluations in cervicovaginal mucosa, and no anti-drug (GRFT) antibodies were detected in serum. No cervicovaginal proinflammatory responses and no changes in the ectocervical transcriptome were evident. Decreased levels of proinflammatory chemokines (CXCL8, CCL5 and CCL20) were observed. GRFT was not detected in plasma. GRFT and GRFT/CG in cervicovaginal lavage samples inhibited HIV and HPV, respectively, in vitro in a dose-dependent fashion.

35051186,"Leading causes of death and high mortality rates in an HIV endemic setting (Kisumu county, Kenya, 2019).",[],PloS one,"In resource-limited settings, underlying causes of death (UCOD) often are not ascertained systematically, leading to unreliable mortality statistics. We reviewed medical charts to establish UCOD for decedents at two high volume mortuaries in Kisumu County, Kenya, and compared ascertained UCOD to those notified to the civil registry.
Medical experts trained in COD certification examined medical charts and ascertained causes of death for 456 decedents admitted to the mortuaries from April 16 through July 12, 2019. Decedents with unknown HIV status or who had tested HIV-negative >90 days before the date of death were tested for HIV. We calculated annualized all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates grouped according to global burden of disease (GBD) categories and separately for deaths due to HIV/AIDS and expressed estimated deaths per 100,000 population. We compared notified to ascertained UCOD using Cohen's Kappa (κ) and assessed for the independence of proportions using Pearson's chi-squared test.
The four leading UCOD were HIV/AIDS (102/442 [23.1%]), hypertensive disease (41/442 [9.3%]), other cardiovascular diseases (23/442 [5.2%]), and cancer (20/442 [4.5%]). The all-cause mortality rate was 1,086/100,000 population. The highest cause-specific mortality was in GBD category II (noncommunicable diseases; 516/100,000), followed by GBD I (communicable, perinatal, maternal, and nutritional; 513/100,000), and III (injuries; 56/100,000). The HIV/AIDS mortality rate was 251/100,000 population. The proportion of deaths due to GBD II causes was higher among females (51.9%) than male decedents (42.1%; p = 0.039). Conversely, more men/boys (8.6%) than women/girls (2.1%) died of GBD III causes (p = 0.002). Most of the records with available recorded and ascertained UCOD (n = 236), 167 (70.8%) had incorrectly recorded UCOD, and agreement between notified and ascertained UCOD was poor (29.2%; κ = 0.26).
Mortality from infectious diseases, especially HIV/AIDS, is high in Kisumu County, but there is a shift toward higher mortality from noncommunicable diseases, possibly reflecting an epidemiologic transition and improving HIV outcomes. The epidemiologic transition suggests the need for increased focus on controlling noncommunicable conditions despite the high communicable disease burden. The weak agreement between notified and ascertained UCOD could lead to substantial inaccuracies in mortality statistics, which wholly depend on death notifications.",,,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0261162,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Waruru', 'firstname': 'Anthony', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Division of Global HIV and TB, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Nairobi, Kenya.'}, {'lastname': 'Onyango', 'firstname': 'Dickens', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Kisumu County Department of Health, Kisumu, Kenya.\nDepartment of Public Health, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium.\nJulius Global Health, Julius Centre for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Centre, Utrecht, Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Nyagah', 'firstname': 'Lilly', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Ministry of Health, National AIDS and STI Control Programme, Nairobi, Kenya.'}, {'lastname': 'Sila', 'firstname': 'Alex', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Global Programs for Research and Training, Nairobi, Kenya.'}, {'lastname': 'Waruiru', 'firstname': 'Wanjiru', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Global Programs for Research and Training, Nairobi, Kenya.'}, {'lastname': 'Sava', 'firstname': 'Solomon', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Referral Hospital, Kisumu, Kenya.'}, {'lastname': 'Oele', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Kisumu County Department of Health, Kisumu, Kenya.'}, {'lastname': 'Nyakeriga', 'firstname': 'Emmanuel', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Global Programs for Research and Training, Nairobi, Kenya.'}, {'lastname': 'Muuo', 'firstname': 'Sheru W', 'initials': 'SW', 'affiliation': 'Global Programs for Research and Training, Nairobi, Kenya.'}, {'lastname': 'Kiboye', 'firstname': 'Jacqueline', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Civil Registration Services, Kisumu County, Kenya.'}, {'lastname': 'Musingila', 'firstname': 'Paul K', 'initials': 'PK', 'affiliation': 'Division of Global HIV and TB, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Nairobi, Kenya.'}, {'lastname': 'van der Sande', 'firstname': 'Marianne A B', 'initials': 'MAB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Public Health, Institute of Tropical Medicine, Antwerp, Belgium.\nJulius Global Health, Julius Centre for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Centre, Utrecht, Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Massawa', 'firstname': 'Thaddeus', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Kisumu County Referral Hospital, Kisumu, Kenya.'}, {'lastname': 'Rogena', 'firstname': 'Emily A', 'initials': 'EA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Human Pathology, School of Medicine, College of Health Sciences, Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Nairobi, Kenya.'}, {'lastname': 'DeCock', 'firstname': 'Kevin M', 'initials': 'KM', 'affiliation': 'Division of Global HIV and TB, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Nairobi, Kenya.'}, {'lastname': 'Young', 'firstname': 'Peter W', 'initials': 'PW', 'affiliation': 'Division of Global HIV and TB, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Nairobi, Kenya.'}]"

Intercostal nerve blocks (ICNBs) are useful for breast lumpectomy as either the primary anesthetic or as an adjuvant anesthetic procedure. To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated the association between Horner syndrome and ICNB.
This study aimed to explore the characteristics of and related risk factors for Horner syndrome after ICNB.
A prospective, nested case-control study.
Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Centre from April 2020 through July 2020.
Patients scheduled for breast lumpectomy under ICNB from April 2020 through July 2020 in our hospital were recruited. The ICNB was introduced at the intersection of the midaxillary line and the inferior border of the ribs, according to the location of the mass. Horner syndrome indicators were assessed one, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes and 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours after ICNB. Personal data (age, body mass index [BMI], ASA classes), data on anesthetic (the puncture points, dose of local anesthetics, duration of ICNB, Horner syndrome indicators, other complications) and data on postoperative recovery (postoperative activity time, postoperative feeding time) were recorded. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.
Ipsilateral Horner syndrome was found in 35 of 998 (3.5%) patients. Ipsilateral miosis, the first symptom to appear and last to disappear, occurred within 4 minutes and lasted 45 minutes to 240 minutes after ICNB. Seven patients showed obvious ipsilateral facial flushing. Logistic multivariate regression analysis showed that independent risk factors for Horner syndrome after ICNB were age <= 45 years, body mass index <= 18.5 kg/m2, and the need for a second ICNB.
Firstly, the patients in this study are all adult women, and the applicability of other populations is uncertain. Secondly, the flow trajectory of local anesthetics was not confirmed by imaging tracers.
ICNB via an anterolateral approach promoted enhanced recovery after breast lumpectomy. The incidence of Horner syndrome following ICNB for breast lumpectomy was 3.5%. Horner syndrome occurred on the ipsilateral side of the ICNB and was reversible. Younger age, lower BMI, and the need for a second ICNB were risk factors for Horner syndrome after ICNB.

However, BTX might also protect SG against sialotoxic radioligand cancer therapies. The radioligand Actinium-225-PSMA effectively targets Prostate Cancer (PCa) metastases but inevitably destroys SG due to unintended gland uptake. A preliminary case series with regular-dose IncoA failed to reduce SG PSMA-radioligand uptake. We therefore increased IncoA dosage in combination with transdermal scopolamine until a clinically relevant SG PSMA-radioligand uptake reduction was achieved. Ten consecutive men with metastasized PCa refractory to all other cancer therapies received gradually increasing IncoA dosages as part of a compassionate use PSMA-radioligand-therapy trial. The parotid gland received six and the submandibular gland three injection points under ultrasound control, up to a maximum of 30 units IncoA per injection point. A maximum total dose of 250 units IncoA was applied with up to 170 units per parotid and 80 units per submandibular gland. Treatment was well tolerated and all side-effects were non-serious.

Multiple BoNT serotypes exist, with types A, B and E being the main cause of human botulism. Their extreme toxicity has been exploited for cosmetic and therapeutic uses to treat a wide range of neuromuscular disorders. Although naturally occurring BoNT types share a common end effect, their activity varies significantly based on the neuronal cell-surface receptors and intracellular SNARE substrates they target. These properties are the result of structural variations that have traditionally been studied using biophysical methods such as X-ray crystallography. Here, we determined the first structures of botulinum neurotoxins using single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy. The maps obtained at 3.6 and 3.7 Å for BoNT/B and /E, respectively, highlight the subtle structural dynamism between domains, and of the binding domain in particular. This study demonstrates how the recent advances made in the field of single-particle electron microscopy can be applied to bacterial toxins of clinical relevance and the botulinum neurotoxin family in particular.",,,,,10.3390/toxins14010014,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Košenina', 'firstname': 'Sara', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Stockholm University, 10691 Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Martínez-Carranza', 'firstname': 'Markel', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Stockholm University, 10691 Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Davies', 'firstname': 'Jonathan R', 'initials': 'JR', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Stockholm University, 10691 Stockholm, Sweden.'}, {'lastname': 'Masuyer', 'firstname': 'Geoffrey', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Stockholm University, 10691 Stockholm, Sweden.\nCentre for Therapeutic Innovation, Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, University of Bath, Bath BA2 7AY, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Stenmark', 'firstname': 'Pål', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Stockholm University, 10691 Stockholm, Sweden.\nDepartment of Experimental Medical Science, Lund University, 22184 Lund, Sweden.'}]"

It was reported its genotoxic, carcinogenic, goitrogenic effects. On the other side, AITC has shown anti-cancer, cardioprotective, neuroprotective, and lately anti-obesity abilities. So far, its anti-diabetic effects are poorly explored. We tried to assess AITC action on carbohydrate, lipid and hormonal disorders in high fat diet-fed/streptozotocin diabetic rats. In this report, diabetic rats were treated intragastrically at doses 2.5, 5 and 25 mg/kg b.w./day of AITC for 2 weeks. Irrespectively of doses, AITC considerably lowered thyroid hormones (fT4, fT3), increased liver TG content, and also caused robust LDL-cholesterol and direct bilirubin concentration enhancement. Moreover, AITC at the highest dose caused pancreatic amylase and lipase drops and thyroid gland hypertrophy. AITC at 2.5 and 5 mg significantly reduced blood glucose levels along with robust beta-hydroxybutyric acid drop. Additionally, AITC at 5 mg improved insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR index) in spite of reduced blood insulin. To conclude, despite amelioration of diabetic hyperglycemia by AITC, the adverse lipids and hormonal effects may exclude its use as a health-promoting compound in terms of anti-diabetic properties.",,,,,10.3390/toxins14010003,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Okulicz', 'firstname': 'Monika', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Animal Physiology, Biochemistry and Biostructure, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, Poznan University of Life Sciences, Wołyńska 35, 60-637 Poznan, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Hertig', 'firstname': 'Iwona', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Animal Physiology, Biochemistry and Biostructure, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, Poznan University of Life Sciences, Wołyńska 35, 60-637 Poznan, Poland.'}, {'lastname': 'Szkudelski', 'firstname': 'Tomasz', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Animal Physiology, Biochemistry and Biostructure, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine and Animal Science, Poznan University of Life Sciences, Wołyńska 35, 60-637 Poznan, Poland.'}]"

Knowledge and behaviors around sun exposure protective measures are poorly described in athletes including runners. Our primary objective was to describe sun exposure behaviors and knowledge in a population of runners. A cross-sectional online survey was administered to 697 runners to measure the frequency of seven sun protective behaviors: sunscreen use on the face or body; wearing a hat, sunglasses, or long sleeves; running in shade; and avoidance of midday running. Between 54% and 84% of runners reported that they engaged in these behaviors at least sometimes, but only 7% to 45% reported frequent use. Of 525 runners who gave a primary reason for not using sunscreen regularly, 49.0% cited forgetfulness; 17.3% cited discomfort; and only a small percentage cited maintaining a tan (6.1%) or optimizing vitamin D (5.1%). Of 689 runners who responded to a question about what factor most influences their overall sun exposure habits, 39.2% cited fear of skin cancer, 28.7% cited comfort level, and 15.8% cited fear of skin aging. In addition to the seven individual behaviors, we also asked runners how frequently they took precautions to protect against the sun overall. We explored associations between participant characteristics and the overall use of sun protection using ordinal logistic regression. Overall, sun protection was used more frequently in runners who were female, older, or had a history of skin cancer. Runners appear to recognize the importance of sun protection and the potential consequences of not using it, but report forgetfulness and discomfort as the biggest barriers to consistent use.

A combined retrospective/prospective cohort study was performed at an academic tertiary care ICU on all patients admitted with a length of stay longer than 48 hours and Braden scale score of 18 or less. Following retrospective data collection (preintervention), a multimodal quality improvement bundle focusing on PI prevention through leadership initiatives, visual tools, and staff/patient education was developed, and data were prospectively collected (postintervention).
Statistical and cost analyses were performed comparing both cohorts. A total of 930 patients met the study inclusion criteria (preintervention, n = 599; postintervention, n = 331). A significant decrease in PI incidence was observed from preintervention (n = 37 [6%]) to postintervention (n = 7 [2%], P = .005). This led to a predicted yearly cost savings of $826,810. Further, a significant increase in time to PI occurrence was observed from preintervention (mean, 5 days) to postintervention (mean, 9 days; P = .04).

The utility of genomic subtyping has been challenged due to inter- and intra-focal heterogeneity. We sought to characterize the subtype-defining molecular alterations of primary prostate cancer across all tumor foci within radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens and determine the prevalence of collision tumors.
From the Early Detection Research Network cohort, we identified 333 prospectively collected RPs from 2010 to 2014 and assessed ERG, SPINK1, PTEN, and SPOP molecular status. We utilized dual ERG/SPINK1 immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridization to confirm ERG rearrangements and characterize PTEN deletion, and high-resolution melting curve analysis and Sanger sequencing to determine SPOP mutation status. Analysis of biochemical recurrence-free of patients with collision tumors was conducted using Kaplan-Meier method.
Based on index focus alone, ERG, SPINK1, PTEN, and SPOP alterations were identified in 47.5%, 10.8%, 14.3%, and 5.1% of RP specimens, respectively. In 233 multifocal RPs with ERG/SPINK1 status in all foci, 139 (59.7%) had discordant molecular alterations between foci.

""Positive Attitudes Striving to Rejuvenate You: PASTRY"" was developed at a tertiary cancer center to reduce the burden of moral distress among oncology nurses.
A Quality Improvement (QI) initiative was conducted using a pre- and post-intervention design, to launch PASTRY and measure its impact on moral distress of the nursing unit, using Hamric's Moral Distress Scale-Revised (MDS-R.) This program consisted of monthly 60-minute sessions allowing nurses to address morally distressing events and themes, such as clinicians giving ""false hope"" to patients or families. The PASTRY program sessions were led by certified clinicians utilizing strategies of discussion and mind-body practices.
Clinical nurses working on an adult leukemia/lymphoma unit.
This was a QI initiative, participation was voluntary, MDS-R responses were collected anonymously, and the institution's Ethics Committee oversaw PASTRY's implementation.
While improvement in moral distress findings were not statistically significant, the qualitative and quantitative findings demonstrated consistent themes. The PASTRY program received strong support from nurses and institutional leaders, lowered the nursing unit's moral distress, led to enhanced camaraderie, and improved nurses' coping skills.
Measurement of moral distress is innately challenging due to its complexity. This study reinforces oncology nurses have measurable moral distress. Interventions should be implemented for a safe and healing environment to explore morally distressing clinical experiences. Poor communication among multidisciplinary team members is associated with moral distress among nurses. Programs like PASTRY may empower nurses to build support networks for change within themselves and institutions.
This QI initiative shows further research on moral distress reduction should be conducted to verify findings for statistical significance and so that institutional programs, like PASTRY, can be created.","This QI initiative shows further research on moral distress reduction should be conducted to verify findings for statistical significance and so that institutional programs, like PASTRY, can be created.",,,,10.1177/09697330211062984,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Sarro', 'firstname': 'Emily Long', 'initials': 'EL', 'affiliation': '5803Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Haviland', 'firstname': 'Kelly', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': '5803Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chow', 'firstname': 'Kimberly', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': '5803Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Sequeira', 'firstname': 'Sonia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': '5803Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'McEachen', 'firstname': 'Mary Eliza', 'initials': 'ME', 'affiliation': '5803Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'King', 'firstname': 'Kerry', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': '5803Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Aho', 'firstname': 'Lauren', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': '5803Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Coyle', 'firstname': 'Nessa', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': '5803Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Hao', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': '5803Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Lynch', 'firstname': 'Kathleen A', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': '5803Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Voigt', 'firstname': 'Louis', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': '5803Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'McCabe', 'firstname': 'Mary S', 'initials': 'MS', 'affiliation': '51647National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, Silver Spring, MD, USA.'}]"

35050788,Responsiveness to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors Is Associated With a Peripheral Blood T-Cell Signature in Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.,[],JCO precision oncology,"Although most patients with microsatellite instable (MSI) metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) respond to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), only a small subset of patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors have similar benefit. Biomarkers defining ICB-susceptible subsets of patients with MSS mCRPC are urgently needed.
Using next-generation T-cell repertoire sequencing, we explored immune signatures in 54 patients with MSS and MSI mCRPC who were treated with or without ICB. We defined subset-specific immune metrics as well as T-cell clusters and correlated the signatures with treatment benefit.
Consistent overlaps between tumor and peripheral T-cell repertoires suggested that blood was an informative material to identify relevant T-cell signatures. We found considerably higher blood T-cell richness and diversity and more shared T-cell clusters with low generation probability (pGen) in MSI versus MSS mCRPC, potentially reflecting more complex T-cell responses because of a greater neoepitope load in the MSI subset. Interestingly, patients with MSS mCRPC with shared low pGen T-cell clusters showed significantly better outcomes with ICB, but not with other treatments, compared with patients without such clusters. Blood clearance of T-cell clusters on ICB treatment initiation seemed to be compatible with T-cell migration to the primary tumor or metastatic sites during the process of clonal replacement as described for other tumors receiving ICB.
The MSI mCRPC subset shows a distinct T-cell signature that can be detected in blood. This signature points to immune parameters that could help identify a subset of patients with MSS mCRPC who may have an increased likelihood of responding to ICB or to combination approaches including ICB.",The MSI mCRPC subset shows a distinct T-cell signature that can be detected in blood.

Analysis of tumor genomics obtained via circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can provide a comprehensive overview of tumor evolution. Here, we evaluated ctDNA change as an early prognostic biomarker of subsequent radiologic progression and survival in MBC.
Paired blood samples from patients with MBC were analyzed for levels of ctDNA, carcinoembryonic antigen, and cancer antigen 15-3 at baseline and during treatment. A Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified sequencing panel of 73 genes was used to quantify tumor-specific point mutations in ctDNA. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted to evaluate the association between ctDNA rise from baseline to during-treatment (genomic progression) and subsequent radiologic progression and progression-free survival (PFS).

35050780,Development and Validation of a Genomic Tool to Predict Seminal Vesicle Invasion in Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate.,[],JCO precision oncology,"Pretreatment estimates of seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) are challenging and significantly influence the management of prostate cancer. We sought to improve current models to predict SVI through the development of an SVI prediction genomic signature.
A total of 15,889 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) with available baseline clinical, pathology, and transcriptome data were retrieved from the GRID registry (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02609269) and other retrospective cohorts. These data were divided into a training (n = 6,766), test (n = 3,363), and two validation (n = 5,062 and 698) cohorts. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess the predictive effect of the genomic SVI (gSVI) classifier in the presence of established nomograms (Partin Tables and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center [MSKCC]).
In the training cohort, univariable filtering identified 2,132 genes that were differentially expressed between RP tumors with and without SVI. Model parameters were tuned to maximize the area under the curve (AUC) in the testing cohort, resulting in a logistic generalized linear model with 581 genes. The gSVI model scores range from 0 to 1. In the first validation set, gSVI showed superior discrimination of patients with and without SVI at RP compared with other prognostic signatures trained to predict distant metastasis or clinical recurrence. Of the 698 patients in the second validation set, gSVI combined with the MSKCC nomogram had a superior AUC (0.86) compared with either nomogram individually (0.81).
The gSVI represents a novel and validated expression signature to predict the presence of SVI before treatment with surgery.

35050777,Meta-Analysis of PD-L1 Expression As a Predictor of Survival After Checkpoint Blockade.,[],JCO precision oncology,"Programmed cell death receptor ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression is the most studied biomarker to predict the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), but its clinical significance is controversial. We estimated the distribution of PD-L1 expression scores (ie, tumor proportion score or combined proportion score) and the relationship between PD-L1 levels and ICIs' impact on overall survival (OS).
We reconstructed, pooled, and analyzed individual-level data on 7,617 patients with cancer from 14 randomized clinical trials. The effects of ICIs were quantified using differences in 24-month restricted mean survival times (ΔRMSTs; ie, the increase in life expectancy truncated at 2 years associated with ICI therapy). In a simulation study, we compared standard randomized clinical trial designs with a trial design that leverages meta-analytic results like ours.
Approximately 93% of patients had a PD-L1 expression ≤ 5% (66% of patients) or > 50% (27% of patients). OS improves with ICIs regardless of PD-L1 expression level, which predicts the benefits' magnitude. For patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ΔRMSTs ranged from 1.4 months (95% probability interval [PI], 0.7 to 2.2 months) for PD-L1 expression ≤ 1% to 4.1 months (95% PI, 3.2 to 5.2 months) for PD-L1 expression > 80%. For patients with non-NSCLC tumors, ΔRMSTs ranged from 0.8 months (95% PI, -0.1 to 1.7 months) to 2.3 months (95% PI, 1.3 to 4.4 months), again for PD-L1 expression levels of ≤ 1% and > 80%, respectively. Simulations suggested that designs tailored to meta-analytic results can detect the effects of ICIs in PD-L1 subgroups with higher probability (> 15%) than standard designs.
The practice of dichotomizing the range of PD-L1 expression scores is inadequate for patient stratification. Meta-analytic estimates of the distribution of PD-L1 scores and subgroup-specific treatment effects can improve the designs of future trials of ICIs.",The practice of dichotomizing the range of PD-L1 expression scores is inadequate for patient stratification.

Using a next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel (OncoPanel), we developed an algorithm to identify MMR-D frequency in tumor samples and applied it in a clinical setting with pathologist review.
To predict MMR-D, we adapted methods described previously for use in NGS panels, which assess patterns of single base-pair insertion or deletion events occurring in homopolymer regions. Tumors assayed with OncoPanel between July 2013 and July 2018 were included. For tumors tested after June 2017, sequencing results were presented to pathologists in real time for clinical MMR determination, in the context of tumor mutation burden, other mutational signatures, and clinical data.
Of 20,301 tumors sequenced, 2.7% (553) were retrospectively classified as MMR-D by the algorithm. Of 4,404 samples with pathologist sign-out of MMR status, the algorithm classified 147 (3.3%) as MMR-D: in 116 cases, MMR-D was confirmed by a pathologist, five cases were overruled by the pathologist, and 26 were assessed as indeterminate. Overall, the highest frequencies of OncoPanel-inferred MMR-D were in endometrial (21%; 152/723), colorectal (9.7%; 169/1,744), and small bowel (9.3%; 9/97) cancers. When algorithm predictions were compared with historical MMR immunohistochemistry or polymerase chain reaction results in a set of 325 tumors sequenced before initiation of pathologist assessment, the overall sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm were 91.1% and 98.2%, respectively.
We show that targeted, tumor-only NGS can be leveraged to determine MMR signatures across tumor types, suggesting that broader biomarker screening approaches may have clinical value.","We show that targeted, tumor-only NGS can be leveraged to determine MMR signatures across tumor types, suggesting that broader biomarker screening approaches may have clinical value.",,"Of 20,301 tumors sequenced, 2.7% (553) were retrospectively classified as MMR-D by the algorithm.

Inconsistent coverage and variable payment is hindering NGS adoption into clinical practice. A review of test utilization, clinical utility, coverage, and reimbursement was conducted in a cohort of patients diagnosed with high-risk cancer who received pan-cancer panel testing as part of their clinical care.
The Columbia Combined Cancer Panel (CCCP), a 467-gene panel designed to detect DNA variations in solid and liquid tumors, was performed in the Laboratory of Personalized Genomic Medicine at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Utilization was characterized at test order. Results were reviewed by a molecular pathologist, followed by a multidisciplinary molecular tumor board where clinical utility was classified by consensus. Reimbursement was reviewed after payers provided final coverage decisions.
NGS was performed on 359 high-risk tumors from 349 patients. Reimbursement data were available for 246 cases. The most common reason providers ordered CCCP testing was for patients diagnosed with a treatment-resistant or recurrent tumor (n = 214; 61%). Findings were clinically impactful for 229 cases (64%). Molecular alterations that may inform future therapy in the event of progression or relapse were found in 42% of cases, and a targeted therapy was initiated in 23 cases (6.6%).

35050739,CES2 Expression in Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Is Predictive of Response to Irinotecan and Is Associated With Type 2 Diabetes.,[],JCO precision oncology,"The combination chemotherapy of fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) has provided clinically meaningful improvement for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We previously uncovered a role for the serine hydrolase carboxylesterase 2 (CES2) in mediating intratumoral activation of the prodrug irinotecan, a constituent of FOLFIRINOX. We aimed to further test the predictive value of CES2 for response to irinotecan using patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and to elucidate the determinants of CES2 expression and response to FOLFIRINOX treatment among patients with PDAC.
PDXs were engrafted subcutaneously into nude mice and treated for 4 weeks with either saline control or irinotecan. CES2 and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A) expression in PDAC tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were applied to assess the association between overall survival and hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) levels in patients who underwent neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX treatment.
High CES2 activity in PDAC PDXs was associated with increased sensitivity to irinotecan. Integrated gene expression, proteomic analyses, and in vitro genetic experiments revealed that nuclear receptor HNF4A, which is upregulated in diabetes, is the upstream transcriptional regulator of CES2 expression. Elevated CES2 protein expression in PDAC tissues was positively associated with a history of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio, 4.84; 
To our knowledge, we provide, for the first time, evidence that CES2 expression is associated with a history of type 2 diabetes in PDAC and that elevated HbA1C, by predicting tumor CES2 expression, may represent a novel marker for stratifying patients most likely to respond to FOLFIRINOX therapy.","To our knowledge, we provide, for the first time, evidence that CES2 expression is associated with a history of type 2 diabetes in PDAC and that elevated HbA1C, by predicting tumor CES2 expression, may represent a novel marker for stratifying patients most likely to respond to FOLFIRINOX therapy.",,"High CES2 activity in PDAC PDXs was associated with increased sensitivity to irinotecan.

We also identified pathogenic variants in other cancer risk genes, giving consideration to future multigene testing panels for this population.
We performed whole-genome sequencing for 1,037 Japanese individuals, including patients with early-onset CRC (n = 196), BC (n = 237), and PCA (n = 215) and controls (n = 389). We screened for pathogenic variants, including single nucleotide variants and copy number variants, among well-established first-tier cancer genes for each cancer type and examined an expended second-tier panel including cancer-predisposing genes from the Cancer Gene Census.
Proportions of patients with germline pathogenic variants differed by cancer subgroup, with the highest in BC (14.8%), followed by CRC (9.2%), and PCA (3.7%). In contrast, 2 of 389 control subjects (0.5%) carried a germline pathogenic variant. In comparison with controls, the proportion of patients with pathogenic variants in the second-tier panel was increased significantly for PCA (3.7% to 11.6%,

Secondary outcomes of interest included biochemical recurrence & receipt of secondary treatment.
The median GRS score was lower in the low testosterone group compared to the intermediate & normal testosterone groups (0.38 Vs. 0.52 Vs. 0.53, respectively; p=0.049). There was no difference in BCR-free survival between the three testosterone groups (p=0.9).

However, the effects of APOBEC-induced protein changes have not been systematically assessed. Here, we describe the effects of APOBEC on the coding sequence in primary and metastatic estrogen receptor-positive (ER+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer (BC).
We determined the enrichment of amino acid (AA) changes resulting from APOBEC mutagenesis in 323 primary BC tumors and 424 metastatic breast cancer (mBC) lesions via comparison with a simulated mutational genomic landscape not under selection pressure. We subsequently explored genes with recurrent APOBEC-associated AA changes and investigated the clonality of individual APOBEC-associated mutations. Using public sequencing data from an independent primary BC and mBC cohort, we further confirm our findings by reporting genes having these enriched AA changes in an APOBEC context.
Our analysis demonstrated that several APOBEC-derived AA changes are significantly enriched compared with a simulated AA change distribution drawn at random. Among the enriched AA changes, Glutamate(E)>Lysine(K) and Glutamate(E)>Glutamine(Q) were mostly found at hotspots in oncogenes, whereas termination codons (Glutamine[Q]>STOP[X] and Serine[S]>STOP[X]) occurred in tumor suppressor genes and, mostly, not at hotspot locations.

Between September 2016 and June 2019, 105 consecutive patients with high-risk prostate cancer (cT3a+or Grade Group 4/5 or PSA >20 ng/mL) underwent a laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection. First, Cloquet's node was identified, retrieved, and submitted separately to pathology as right and left Cloquet's node. Next, a pelvic lymph node dissection was completed including the external iliac, obturator fossa, and hypogastric nodal packets. Each lymph node was cut in 3-mm slices which were separately embedded in paraffin, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and examined microscopically.

Side effects from the therapy are common, however, because these drugs also affect rapidly dividing noncancerous cells. Hypoxia-activated prodrugs (HAPs) have been developed to reduce these side effects as they preferentially activate in hypoxic environments, a hallmark of solid tumors. CP-506 is a newly developed DNA-alkylating HAP designed to exert strong activity under hypoxia. The resulting CP-506-DNA adducts can be used to elucidate the cellular and molecular effects of CP-506 and its selectivity toward hypoxic conditions. In this study, we characterize the profile of adducts resulting from the reaction of CP-506 and its metabolites CP-506H and CP-506M with DNA. A total of 39 putative DNA adducts were detected in vitro using our high-resolution/accurate-mass (HRAM) liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS",,,,,10.1021/acs.chemrestox.1c00329,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Solivio', 'firstname': 'Morwena J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Stornetta', 'firstname': 'Alessia', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Gilissen', 'firstname': 'Julie', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Convert Pharmaceuticals SA, Liège 4000, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Villalta', 'firstname': 'Peter W', 'initials': 'PW', 'affiliation': 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, United States.\nDepartment of Medicinal Chemistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Deschoemaeker', 'firstname': 'Sofie', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Convert Pharmaceuticals SA, Liège 4000, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Heyerick', 'firstname': 'Arne', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Convert Pharmaceuticals SA, Liège 4000, Belgium.'}, {'lastname': 'Dubois', 'firstname': 'Ludwig', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Convert Pharmaceuticals SA, Liège 4000, Belgium.\nThe D-Lab and The M-Lab, Department of Precision Medicine, GROW─School for Oncology and Developmental Biology, Maastricht Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Maastricht University Medical Centre, Maastricht 6229 ER, The Netherlands.'}, {'lastname': 'Balbo', 'firstname': 'Silvia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Masonic Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, United States.\nDivision of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455, United States.'}]"

One direction that has been firmly established over past years is the conjugation of photosensitizers with various molecules that demonstrate their own cytotoxic activity. As a result, improved selectivity and treatment outcomes are observed compared to those of unconjugated drugs. The attractiveness of such an approach is due to the variability of cytotoxic warheads and specific linkers available for the construction of conjugates. In this review, we summarize and analyze data concerning these inventions with the ultimate goal to find a promising conjugation partner for a porphyrinoid-based photosensitizer. The current challenges toward successful conjugation are also outlined and discussed.

Herein, we construct a CRISPR-Cas-based biosensor for rapid and sensitive measurement of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylases. This biosensor involves a hairpin probe and integrates quadratic strand displacement amplification (SDA) with a CRISPR/Cas12a effector with the characteristics of rapidity (within 40 min) and isothermal assay. The presence of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase can initiate the quadratic SDA to produce large amounts of activators with the assistance of polynucleotide kinase (PNK). Subsequently, the activators can bind with crRNA to activate Cas12a, cleaving signal probes and recovering Cy5 fluorescence, which can be accurately quantified by single-molecule imaging. Notably, the designed hairpin probes can effectively block the hybridization of the generated activators with free hairpin probes, endowing this biosensor with high sensitivity. In addition, the utilization of PNK instead of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE1) greatly simplifies the experimental procedure to only a one-step reaction. The introduction of a single-molecule detection further reduces the sample consumption and improves the sensitivity.

In recent years, MMPs have emerged as promising targets for enzyme-responsive diagnostic probes because oligopeptides can be designed to be selectively hydrolyzed by exposure to these enzymes. With the ultimate goal of developing radio-iodinated peptides as supramolecular building blocks for MMP-sensitive tools for nuclear imaging and therapy, we designed three MMP-9-responsive peptides containing either tyrosine or iodotyrosine to assess the impact of iodotyrosine introduction to the peptide structure and cleavage kinetics. We found that the peptides containing iodotyrosine underwent more rapid and more complete hydrolysis by MMP-9. While the peptides under investigation were predominantly disordered, it was found that iodination increased the degree of aromatic residue-driven aggregation of the peptides. We determined that these iodination-related trends stem from the improved overall intramolecular order through H- and halogen bonding, in addition to intermolecular organization of the self-assembled peptides due to steric and electrostatic effects introduced by the halogenated tyrosine.

35050570,Short FcRn-Binding Peptides Enable Salvage and Transcytosis of scFv Antibody Fragments.,[],ACS chemical biology,"Therapeutic antibodies have become one of the most widely used classes of biotherapeutics due to their unique antigen specificity and their ability to be engineered against diverse disease targets. There is significant interest in utilizing truncated antibody fragments as therapeutics, as their small size affords favorable properties such as increased tumor penetration as well as the ability to utilize lower-cost prokaryotic production methods. Their small size and simple architecture, however, also lead to rapid blood clearance, limiting the efficacy of these potentially powerful therapeutics. A common approach to circumvent these limitations is to enable engagement with the half-life extending neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). This is usually achieved via fusion with a large Fc domain, which negates the benefits of the antibody fragment's small size. In this work, we show that modifying antibody fragments with short FcRn-binding peptide domains that mimic native IgG engagement with FcRn enables binding and FcRn-mediated recycling and transmembrane transcytosis in cell-based assays. Further, we show that rational, single amino acid mutations to the peptide sequence have a significant impact on the receptor-mediated function and investigate the underlying structural basis for this effect using computational modeling. Finally, we report the identification of a short peptide from human serum albumin that enables FcRn-mediated function when grafted onto a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) scaffold, establishing an approach for the rational selection of short-peptide domains from full-length proteins that could enable the transfer of non-native functions to small recombinant proteins without significantly impacting their size or structure.",,,,,10.1021/acschembio.1c00862,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Kelly', 'firstname': 'Vince W', 'initials': 'VW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Bioengineering, University of Illinois, Urbana, Illinois 61801, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Sirk', 'firstname': 'Shannon J', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Bioengineering, University of Illinois, Urbana, Illinois 61801, United States.\nDepartment of Biomedical and Translational Sciences, Carle Illinois College of Medicine, University of Illinois, Urbana, Illinois 61801, United States.\nCarl R.

The current study aimed to investigate the role of miR-1321 and miR-7515 regulation in CDC20 during NSCLC development. CDC20 expression in paracancerous and tumor tissues was assessed using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The relationship between CDC20 expression and prognosis of patients was analyzed using the TCGA database. The expression profile of CDC20 in healthy lung cells and NSCLC cells was detected using qRT-PCR and western blotting. After the knockdown of CDC20 in NSCLC cells, the cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, and cell cycle changes were investigated by CCK8, EdU, flow cytometry, wound healing, and Transwell assays. The miRNAs targeting CDC20 were predicted using two bioinformatics websites and validated using dual-luciferase assays. CDC20 was enhanced in NSCLC tissues and cells, thus predicting the poor prognosis in NSCLC patients. After CDC20 inhibition, the malignant phenotype of NSCLC cells was reverted. miR-1321 and miR-7515 targeted CDC20 and exhibited the same anti-tumor effects as CDC20 silencing. Functional rescue experiments showed that CDC20 overexpression averted the anti-tumor effects of miR-1321 and miR-7515 on NSCLC cells. miR-1321 and miR-7515 inhibited NSCLC development by targeting CDC20.

Recent studies have suggested a sexually dimorphic role of microglia in the maintenance of neuropathic pain in rodents. Here, we utilized RNA sequencing analysis and in vitro primary cultures of microglia to identify whether there is a common neuropathic microglial signature and characterize the sex differences in microglia in pain-related regions in nerve injury and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy mouse models. While mechanical allodynia and behavioral changes were observed in all models, transcriptomic analysis of microglia revealed no common transcriptional changes in spinal and supraspinal regions and in the different neuropathic models. However, there was a substantial change in microglial gene expression within the ipsilateral lumbar spinal cord 7 days after chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve. Both sexes upregulated genes associated with inflammation, phagosome, and lysosome activation, though males revealed a prominent global transcriptional shift not observed in female mice. Transcriptomic comparison between male spinal microglia after CCI and data from other nerve injury models and neurodegenerative microglia demonstrated a unique CCI-induced signature reflecting acute activation of microglia. Further, in vitro studies revealed that only male microglia from nerve-injured mice developed a reactive phenotype with increased phagocytotic activity. This study demonstrates a lack of a common neuropathic microglial signature and indicates distinct sex differences in spinal microglia, suggesting they contribute to the sex-specific pain processing following nerve injury.",,,,© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.,10.1002/glia.24133,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Fiore', 'firstname': 'Nathan T', 'initials': 'NT', 'affiliation': 'Translational Neuroscience Facility, Department of Physiology, School of Medical Sciences, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Yin', 'firstname': 'Zhuoran', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': ""Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Guneykaya', 'firstname': 'Dilansu', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Gauthier', 'firstname': 'Christian D', 'initials': 'CD', 'affiliation': ""Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Hayes', 'firstname': 'Jessica P', 'initials': 'JP', 'affiliation': 'Translational Neuroscience Facility, Department of Physiology, School of Medical Sciences, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.'}, {'lastname': ""D'Hary"", 'firstname': 'Aaron', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Translational Neuroscience Facility, Department of Physiology, School of Medical Sciences, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.'}, {'lastname': 'Butovsky', 'firstname': 'Oleg', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': ""Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases, Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.\nEvergrande Center for Immunologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.""}, {'lastname': 'Moalem-Taylor', 'firstname': 'Gila', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Translational Neuroscience Facility, Department of Physiology, School of Medical Sciences, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.'}]"

While little is known about its involvement in liver fibrosis, PTTG1 expression is associated with DLK1. We assessed the role of the PTTG1/DLK1 pathway in fibrosis progression and the potential therapeutic effect of PTTG1 silencing in fibrosis.
Pttg1 and Dlk1 were studied in liver and isolated cell populations of control and fibrotic rats and in human liver biopsies. The fibrotic molecular signature was analyzed in Pttg1 KO and WT fibrotic mice. Finally, Pttg1 silencing was evaluated in rats as a novel antifibrotic therapy.
Pttg1 and Dlk1 mRNA selectively increased in fibrotic rats paralleling fibrosis progression. Serum DLK1 concentrations correlated with hepatic collagen content and systemic and portal hemodynamics. Human cirrhotic livers showed greater PTTG1 and DLK1 transcript abundance than non-cirrhotic, and reduced collagen was observed in Pttg1 KO mice. The liver fibrotic molecular signature revealed lower expression of genes related to extracellular matrix remodeling including Mmp8 and 9 and Timp4 and greater eotaxin and Mmp13 than fibrotic WT mice. Finally, interfering Pttg1 resulted in reduced liver fibrotic area, lower α-2-Sma and decreased portal pressure than fibrotic animals. Furthermore, Pttg1 silencing decreased the transcription of Dlk1, collagens I and III, Pdgfβ, Tgfrβ, Timp1, Timp2, and Mmp2.

Previous studies associated shorter time to recurrence (TTR) in months, node-positive primary tumor, and more than one site of recurrence with worse outcomes.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study across four Canadian institutions to externally validate previously established prognostic factors of overall survival (OS). We included consecutive adult patients who had a recurrence following curative-intent liver resection for CRM. Prognostic factors were explored using a multivariable Cox regression model. Risk group cutoffs were identified through recursive partitioning. OS between low- and high-risk groups was compared using the Kaplan-Meier method.
This study included 471 patients. Shorter TTR in months (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.93-0.97), presence of extrahepatic disease at first hepatectomy (HR: 2.54, 95% CI: 1.18-5.50), and larger tumor size in millimetres (HR: 1.01, 95% CI: 1.00-1.02) were associated with worse OS. Median OS in the high- and low-risk groups were 40.5 (95% CI: 34.0-45.7 months) versus 64.7 months (95% CI: 57.9-72.3 months; p < 0.001), respectively.

The median follow-up duration and age was 56 months (range: 4-229) and 61 years (range: 15-82), respectively.
The median OS and RFS were 70 and 16 months, respectively. A total of 19 (59.4%) patients received systemic chemotherapy, including 14 (43.8%) who received radiation therapy. Further, 22 patients (68.8%) underwent surgery. On univariate analysis, >T2, N+, and tumor size ≥3 cm were associated with poorer OS. There were 15 cases of distant metastasis and five local recurrences. Outcomes were poorest in adenocarcinoma (AC), moderate in clear cell carcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma, and best in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).

We investigated the preventive effect of an active metabolite of tamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OH TAM), on capsular contracture.
A silicone sheet was implanted into the back of 28 female ICR mice. Mixtures of gel with 0.2% 4-OH TAM and 0.1% 4-OH TAM were administered transdermally once a day for 4 weeks. Saline was administered to the control. After killing the mice, capsular thickness was measured in H&E-stained specimens. Estrogen receptor (ER), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) expressions were immunohistochemically investigated in the capsules.
The capsule was thinner in the 0.2% 4-OH TAM gel group than in the control group (control, 0.1% 4-OH TAM gel, 0.2% 4-OH TAM gel: 52.8 ± 3.4 µm, 54.2 ± 6.8 µm, 46.4 ± 3.3 µm, respectively).

35050491,How do phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors affect cancer? A focus on glioblastoma multiforme.,"['Brain malignancies', 'Glioblastoma multiforme', 'PDE5 inhibitors', 'cGMP']",Pharmacological reports : PR,"Since the discovery of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) enzyme overexpression in the central nervous system (CNS) malignancies, investigations have explored the potential capacity of current PDE5 inhibitor drugs for repositioning in the treatment of brain tumors, notably glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). It has now been recognized that these drugs increase brain tumors permeability and enhance standard chemotherapeutics effectiveness. More importantly, studies have highlighted the promising antitumor functions of PDE5 inhibitors, e.g., triggering apoptosis, suppressing tumor cell growth and invasion, and reversing tumor microenvironment (TME) immunosuppression in the brain. However, contradictory reports have suggested a pro-oncogenic role for neuronal cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), indicating the beneficial function of PDE5 in the brain of GBM patients. Unfortunately, due to the inconsistent preclinical findings, only a few clinical trials are evaluating the therapeutic value of PDE5 inhibitors in GBM treatment. Accordingly, additional studies should be conducted to shed light on the precise effect of PDE5 inhibitors in GBM biology regarding the existing molecular heterogeneities among individuals. Here, we highlighted and discussed the previously investigated mechanisms underlying the impacts of PDE5 inhibitors in cancers, focusing on GBM to provide an overview of current knowledge necessary for future studies.",,,,© 2022.

35050486,Metformin exerts an antitumoral effect on papillary thyroid cancer cells through altered cell energy metabolism and sensitized by BACH1 depletion.,"['Anti-tumor', 'BACH1', 'Energy metabolism', 'Metformin', 'Papillary thyroid cancer']",Endocrine,"Aberrant cell energy metabolism is one of the features of thyroid carcinogenesis. Metformin may reduce the risk of cancer, and BACH1 was reported to affect the sensitivity of cancer cells to metformin. The aims of this study were to investigate whether metformin exerts antitumor effects in PTC cells and explore the role of BACH1 depletion on the sensitivity of PTC cells to metformin.
The viability and proliferation of PTC cell lines were analyzed with MTT and colony forming assay. Energy utilization and mitochondrial respiration were measured using Seahorse XF instruments and Mitochondrial complex-1 activity assay.
Our results showed the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of metformin in PTC cells. Furthermore, metformin changed the pattern of cell energy metabolism in PTC cells, which manifested as inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, and the combination of BACH1 depletion with metformin magnified the effect of metformin alone.
In conclusion, metformin exerts an antitumoral effect on PTC cells both in vitro and in xenograft mouse models. A possible mechanism is through inhibiting glucose metabolism and mitochondrial respiration process. Knocking down BACH1 caused the switching of energy metabolism and sensitized PTC cells to metformin, which eventually enhanced the anti-tumor effect of metformin.",,,"Our results showed the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of metformin in PTC cells.

35050485,Efficacy of Risankizumab versus Secukinumab in Patients with Moderate-to-Severe Psoriasis: Subgroup Analysis from the IMMerge Study.,"['Biologics', 'Prior psoriasis treatment', 'Psoriasis', 'Risankizumab', 'Secukinumab', 'Subgroup analysis', 'Weight']",Dermatology and therapy,"Patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who experience poor clinical outcomes, including patients with obesity or prior treatment, need improved treatment options. Risankizumab specifically inhibits interleukin 23 and has demonstrated superior efficacy in active-comparator studies in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. We compared the efficacy of risankizumab with that of secukinumab across patient subgroups.
Subgroup analyses using data from the phase 3 IMMerge study (NCT03478787) were performed. Efficacy in adults with moderate-to-severe psoriasis treated with risankizumab 150 mg and secukinumab 300 mg was assessed as the proportion of patients who achieved ≥ 90% improvement in Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI 90) at week 52 across demographics and disease characteristics. Post hoc analyses evaluated the proportion of patients who achieved PASI 90 and the least-squares mean percent PASI improvement from baseline at week 52 by body weight and body mass index (BMI), PASI 90 by prior treatment, and clinical response [PASI 90, PASI 100, and/or static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) score of clear (0) or almost clear (1)] at week 16 and maintained particular response at week 52. Logistic regression analyses examined the effect of covariates (age, sex, BMI, baseline PASI, treatment) and potential interactions on PASI 90 at week 52.
More patients who received risankizumab (n = 164) compared with secukinumab (n = 163) achieved PASI 90 at week 52, regardless of demographics and disease characteristics (BMI, prior treatment, disease duration, and maintenance of clinical response at week 52). Improvements in PASI were greater in patients taking risankizumab than those taking secukinumab, regardless of weight or BMI. Results from logistic regression analysis showed treatment type had a significant impact on PASI 90 (risankizumab versus secukinumab, p < 0.0001).
Risankizumab showed consistently greater efficacy compared with secukinumab across different patient subgroups, and this was maintained through 52 weeks.
ClinicalTrials.gov identifier; NCT03478787.
Patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis are often unable to achieve treatment success with currently available biologic therapies when they have other conditions, such as obesity, or have previous biologic therapy exposure and/or failure. We studied patients in the IMMerge phase 3 clinical trial (NCT03478787) to assess the efficacy of risankizumab compared with secukinumab for the treatment of plaque psoriasis and to determine risankizumab’s ability to remain effective after 52 weeks of administration. In our analysis, we looked across patient subgroups including patient body weight, body mass index, previous use of biologic therapies, length of time patients had been living with their disease, and the durability of risankizumab efficacy at 52 weeks. Results from our analysis showed that patients had greater success with risankizumab compared with secukinumab in treating their plaque psoriasis, despite their age, sex, race, and disease characteristics, and that risankizumab remained effective in treating plaque psoriasis at week 52. Previously reported safety results from the IMMerge clinical trial showed that there were no new concerns regarding side effects for either risankizumab or secukinumab. Overall, these results support the use of risankizumab to treat patients, including those who have other conditions or may not have had success with other therapies in treating their plaque psoriasis.","Risankizumab showed consistently greater efficacy compared with secukinumab across different patient subgroups, and this was maintained through 52 weeks.",,"More patients who received risankizumab (n = 164) compared with secukinumab (n = 163) achieved PASI 90 at week 52, regardless of demographics and disease characteristics (BMI, prior treatment, disease duration, and maintenance of clinical response at week 52).

We aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of the IASLC grading system for invasive pulmonary adenocarcinoma.
We conducted a retrospective analysis of 471 Japanese patients with resected lung adenocarcinoma. Tumors were classified in accordance with the IASLC grading system and 2015 World Health Organization classification. We analyzed recurrence-free probability (RFP) and overall survival (OS) using the log-rank test and compared the two grading systems using the Cox proportional hazards model.
Grade 3 tumors of the IASLC system and high-grade tumors of the 2015 World Health Organization classification were present in 38% and 17% of patients, respectively. The 5-year RFP was lower in patients with IASLC Grade 3 tumors (45%) than in patients with IASLC Grade 1 and 2 tumors (91% and 83%, respectively). The 5-year RFP of patients with IASLC Grade 2 tumors (83%) was higher than of those with 2015 World Health Organization intermediate tumors (69%). On multivariate analysis for recurrence, IASLC Grade 3 was an independent prognostic factor of worse RFP. We showed similar results on analysis for the OS.
The prognostic significance of IASLC Grade 3 tumors on recurrence-free probability was confirmed through both univariate and multivariate analyses. Thus, the IASLC Grade 3 tumor is an independent factor of poor prognosis in patients with resected lung adenocarcinoma.",,,"Grade 3 tumors of the IASLC system and high-grade tumors of the 2015 World Health Organization classification were present in 38% and 17% of patients, respectively.

Radiotherapy is a common treatment for patients with advanced GC. Many long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been verified to affect the radiosensitivity of multiple cancers in previous studies. Nevertheless, whether lncRNA opioid growth factor receptor pseudogene 1 (OGFRP1) affects the radiosensitivity of GC has not been determined. We hypothesized that OGFRP1 might affect cellular processes in GC development. The present study aims to explore the role of OGFRP1 in GC development. First, high expression of OGFRP1 in GC tissues and cells was determined through RT-qPCR. Subsequently, functional assays including colony formation assays, 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assays and flow cytometry analyses were performed to probe the biological functions of OGFRP1 in GC. Specifically, the effect of OGFRP1 on the radiosensitivity of GC cells was detected. Subsequently, with the help of the starBase tool, we found that miR-149-5p might bind to OGFRP1, which was confirmed through a luciferase reporter assay. Furthermore, we identified that MAP3K3 was targeted by miR-149-5p in GC cells. Finally, the results from rescue experiments validated that enhanced MAP3K3 expression counteracted the effect of OGFRP1 silencing on GC cell proliferation, apoptosis and radiosensitivity. Overall, OGFRP1 was determined to promote GC cell proliferation while suppressing cell apoptosis and radiosensitivity by regulating the miR-149-5p/MAP3K3 axis.",,,,"© 2022.

However, its underlying mechanism has yet to be fully elucidated. Glycolysis-derived lactate has been shown to be a powerful regulator of cancer metastasis. Heat shock protein A12A (HSPA12A) encodes a novel member of HSP70 family. We have recently demonstrated that heat shock protein A12A (HSPA12A) inhibited renal cancer cell migration by suppressing lactate output and glycolytic activity, which were mediated by unstabilizing CD147 and promoting its degradation. By striking contrast, here we demonstrated that HSPA12A promoted migration of human HCC cells. Extracellular acidification, lactate export, and glycolytic activity in HCC cells were also promoted following HSPA12A overexpression. Further analysis revealed that HSPA12A interacted with MCT4 and increased its membrane localization, thereby promoting export of lactate generated from glycolysis; this led, ultimately, to HCC cell migration. Our results revealed the opposite effect of HSPA12A on migration of renal cancer cells and that of HCC cells. Of note, in contrast to the inhibitory effect on CD147 expression in renal cancer cells, we found that HSPA12A increased CD147 expression in HCC cells, indicating that the expression of CD147 might exist heterogeneity in different cancer cell types. Taken together, we identified HSPA12A as an activator of HCC migration, a role opposite to that of renal cancer cells. Inhibiting HSPA12A might be a potential therapeutic intervention for HCC metastasis.",,,,© 2022.

Here we review leukemia stem cell (LSC) biology, particularly as it relates to the very heterogeneous nature of AML and to its high disease relapse rate. Leukemia ontogeny is presented, and the defining functional and phenotypic features of LSCs are explored. Surface and metabolic phenotypes of these cells are described, particularly those that allow distinction from features of normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Opportunities for use of this information for improving therapy for this challenging group of diseases is highlighted, and we explore the clinical needs which may be addressed by emerging LSC data. Finally, we discuss current gaps in the scientific understanding of LSCs.",,,,"© 2021.

35050442,Broad spectrum of regorafenib activity on mutant KIT and absence of clonal selection in gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST): correlative analysis from the GRID trial.,"['GIST', 'KIT', 'Mutation analysis', 'Regorafenib']",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,"In the phase 3 GRID trial, regorafenib improved progression-free survival (PFS) independent of KIT mutations in exons 9 and 11. In this retrospective, exploratory analysis of the GRID trial, we investigated whether a more comprehensive KIT mutation analysis could identify mutations that impact treatment outcome with regorafenib and a regorafenib-induced mutation pattern.
Archived tumor samples, collected at any time prior to enrollment in GRID, were analyzed by Sanger sequencing (n = 102) and next-generation sequencing (FoundationONE; n = 47). Plasma samples collected at baseline were analyzed by BEAMing (n = 163) and SafeSEQ (n = 96).
In archived tumor samples, 67% (68/102) had a KIT mutation; 61% (62/102) had primary KIT mutations (exons 9 and 11) and 12% (12/102) had secondary mutations (exons 13, 14, 17, and 18). At baseline, 81% of samples (78/96) had KIT mutations by SafeSEQ, including the M541L polymorphism (sole event in 6 patients). Coexisting mutations in other oncogenes were rare, as were mutations in PDGFR, KRAS, and BRAF. Regorafenib showed PFS benefit across all primary and secondary KIT mutational subgroups examined. Available patient-matched samples taken at baseline and end of treatment (n = 41; SafeSEQ), revealed heterogeneous KIT mutational changes with no specific mutation pattern emerging upon regorafenib treatment.
These data support the results of the GRID trial, and suggest that patients may benefit from regorafenib in the presence of KIT mutations and without the selection of particular mutation patterns that confer resistance. The study was not powered to address biomarker-related questions, and the results are exploratory and hypothesis-generating.","These data support the results of the GRID trial, and suggest that patients may benefit from regorafenib in the presence of KIT mutations and without the selection of particular mutation patterns that confer resistance.

35050435,"Multicenter phase II study of trifluridine/tipiracil for esophageal squamous carcinoma refractory/intolerant to 5-fluorouracil, platinum compounds, and taxanes: the ECTAS study.","['Chemotherapy', 'Clinical trial', 'Esophageal cancer', 'Safety', 'Trifluridine']",Esophagus : official journal of the Japan Esophageal Society,"The standard treatment for unresectable advanced/recurrent esophageal cancer in Japan is 5-fluorouracil plus platinum-containing drugs as first-line chemotherapy and taxanes as second-line chemotherapy. However, the standard regimen after patients become refractory to these treatments remains to be established. Therefore, we investigated the efficacy of trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD/TPI) in patients with esophageal cancer who are refractory or intolerant to 5-fluorouracil, platinum-containing drugs, and taxanes.
This single-arm phase II trial was conducted in seven hospitals in Japan. Eligible patients were those with unresectable advanced/recurrent esophageal cancer that was refractory or intolerant to 5-fluorouracil, platinum-containing drugs, and taxanes. The primary endpoint was the 3-month progression-free survival rate, and the secondary endpoints were the 6-month progression-free survival rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, response rate, disease control rate, and toxicity.
Forty-two patients were enrolled between October 2015 and June 2016. All tumors were squamous cell carcinomas. The progression-free survival rates at 3 and 6 months were 15.4% (90% confidence interval 7.4-26.0%) and 7.7% (90% confidence interval 2.6-16.6%), respectively. The median progression-free survival and median overall survival were 1.3 (95% confidence interval 1.0-1.8) months and 4.5 (95% confidence interval 3.6-5.7) months, respectively. The response rate was 0%, and the disease control rate was 23.8% (95% confidence interval 13.5-38.5%).

35050434,Transanal versus laparoscopic total mesorectal excision: a comparative study of long-term oncological outcomes.,"['Oncological outcomes', 'Rectal cancer', 'TaTME', 'lapTME']",Techniques in coloproctology,"Transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) is the most recent approach developed to improve pelvic dissection in surgery for mid and low rectal tumors. There are still inconsistencies regarding the technique's oncological results. The aim of this study was to analyze clinical and oncological outcomes of the learning curve of TaTME in comparison to laparoscopic TME (lapTME).
Rectal cancer patients who had TaTME and lapTME in two Portuguese colorectal units between March 2016 and December 2018 were eligible. Primary endpoints were 5-year overall survival, disease-free survival, and local recurrence. Secondary endpoints were clinical and pathological outcomes.
Forty-four patients underwent TaTME (29 men) and 39 lapTME (27 men) with a median age of 69 and 66 (p = 0.093), respectively. No differences were observed concerning baseline characteristics, emphasizing their comparability. In the TaTME group, there were more hand-sewn anastomosis (0 lapTME versus 7 TaTME, p = 0.018) with significantly less distance to the dentate line (40 mm lapTME versus 20 mm TaTME, p = 0.005) and significantly more loop ileostomies performed (28 lapTME versus 41 TaTME, p = 0.001). There were no differences in post-operative mortality, morbidity, readmissions, and stoma closure. Groups were similar in relation to specimen quality, margins, and resectability; however, TaTME had a significantly higher node yield (14 lapTME versus 20 TaTME, p = 0.002). Finally, no disparities were noted in oncological outcomes, namely local and distant recurrence, 5-year overall survival, and disease-free survival.
Even with the disadvantage of the learning curve of a new technique, TaTME appears to be comparable to lapTME, with similar long-term oncological outcomes. It has, however, a demanding learning curve, significant risk for morbidity and should be used only for selected patients.",,,"Forty-four patients underwent TaTME (29 men) and 39 lapTME (27 men) with a median age of 69 and 66 (p = 0.093), respectively.

Glypican-3-expressing gastric cancer (GPC3-GC), characterized as gastric cancer (GC) expressing GPC3, accounts for 11% of the GC cases. However, the expression and mechanism of action of miR-4510 in GPC3-GC have not been clearly defined. We found that miR-4510 expression in GC tissues was significantly lower than that in the adjacent tissues (p < 0.001). miRNA-4510 expression in GPC3-GC was significantly lower than that in GPC3-negative GC tissue (p < 0.001). Our study confirmed that miR-4510 is inversely correlated with GPC3 in gastric cancer samples and that GPC3 is a direct target gene of miR-4510. The proportion of M2 macrophages in GC with low expression of miR-4510 was significantly increased, while the proliferation of CD8+ T cells was limited. miR-4510 may change the immunosuppressive signals in the tumor microenvironment by downregulating GPC3 and inhibiting gastric cancer cell metastasis. Oxaliplatin treatment may become a specific therapeutic drug for patients with miR-4510 inhibition and GPC3-GC.",,,,© 2022. The Author(s).,"10.1007/s10585-021-10143-6

CircRNA polo-like kinase 1 (circPLK1) was reported to promote breast cancer development. However, the role of circPLK1 in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is unclear. The expression of circPLK1, miR-1294, and high mobility group AT-hook 1 (HMGA1) mRNA was measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Cell viability was detected by CCK-8 assay. Colony formation ability was monitored by colony formation assay. Cell proliferation was detected by EdU assay. Cell migration and cell invasion were monitored by transwell assay. Cancer cell stemness was investigated by sphere formation assay. The protein levels of marker proteins and HMGA1 expression were measured by western blot analysis. The binding relationship between miR-1294 and circPLK1 or HMGA1 was validated by pull-down assay, dual-luciferase reporter assay or RIP assy. Animal study was performed to disclose the role of circPLK1 in vivo. Exosomes were identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). CircPLK1 was upregulated in MPM tumor tissues and cell lines. CircPLK1 knockdown suppressed the proliferation, migration, invasion and stemness of MPM cells. CircPLK1 contained a binding site for miR-1294 and thus bound to miR-1294 to sequester its expression. Inhibition of miR-1294 reversed the effects of circPLK1 knockdown. HMGA1 was a target of miR-1294, and circPLK1 bound to miR-1294 to increase the expression of HMGA1. MiR-1294 restoration also suppressed the proliferation, migration, invasion and stemness of MPM cells, while these effects were abolished by HMGA1 overexpression. In addition, circPLK1 knockdown inhibited tumor growth in vivo. CircPLK1 was overexpressed in exosomes derived from serum of MPM patients. CircPLK1 knockdown inhibited MPM cell proliferation, migration, invasion and stemness by targeting the miR-1294/HMGA1 pathway.",,,,"© 2022.

African Americans (AAs) have up to two times the risk of bladder cancer mortality compared to Caucasians. Bladder cancer mortality increases exponentially once it invades the muscle. Geographic heterogeneity in bladder cancer mortality according to race remains to be determined.
Analysis of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data for 6,044 patients aged 66-85 diagnosed with clinical stage T2-T4 N0M0 bladder cancer from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2011. Fine and Gray-competing risks regression models were used to assess the association of race with bladder cancer-specific mortality (BCSM) according to tumor registry.
Out of 6,044 patients, 5,408 (89.5%) were Caucasian, 352 (5.82%) were non-Hispanic AA, 85 (1.4%) were Hispanic, and 199 (3.29%) were other. Of the 18 registries, AAs with bladder cancer were largely concentrated in Louisiana (19%), New Jersey (17.9%), and Georgia (17.6%). New Jersey was the only registry where AAs had increased risk of BCSM than Caucasians and only for stage T2 disease: (AHR, 1.74; 95% CI 1.22-2.47, p = 0.002).

Despite recent advances in diagnostic imaging for CCA, the early diagnosis of CCA and evaluation of tumor invasion into the bile duct and its surrounding tissues remain challenging. Most patients with CCA are diagnosed at an advanced stage, at which treatment options are limited. Molecular imaging is a promising diagnostic method for noninvasive imaging of biological events at the cellular and molecular level in vivo. Molecular imaging plays a key role in the early diagnosis, staging, and treatment-related evaluation and management of cancer. This review will describe different methods for molecular imaging of CCA, including nuclear medicine, magnetic resonance imaging, optical imaging, and multimodal imaging.

A total of 160 patients with pathologically confirmed breast IDC (training cohort: n = 112; validation cohort: n = 48) who underwent preoperative breast MRI were included. Imaging features were extracted from T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (cT1WI) sequences. A four-step procedure was applied for feature selection and radiomics signature building. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the features associated with LVI, which were then incorporated into the radiomics nomogram. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by its discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness. Kaplan-Meier survival curves based on the two radiomics models were used to estimate disease-free survival (DFS).
The fusion radiomics signature of the T2WI, cT1WI, and ADC maps achieved a better predictive efficacy for LVI than either of them alone. The proposed radiomics nomogram, incorporating the fusion radiomics signature and MRI-reported peritumoral edema, showed satisfactory capabilities of calibration and discrimination in both training and validation datasets, with AUCs of 0.919 (95% CI: 0.871-0.967) and 0.863 (95% CI: 0.726-0.999), respectively. The radiomics signature and nomogram-defined high-risk groups had a shorter DFS than those in the low-risk groups (both p < 0.05). Higher Rad-scores were independently associated with a worse DFS in the whole cohort (p < 0.05).
The proposed nomogram, incorporating multiparametric MRI-based radiomics signature and MRI-reported peritumoral edema, achieved a satisfactory preoperative prediction of LVI and clinical outcomes in IDC patients.
• The fusion radiomics signature of the T2WI, cT1WI, and ADC maps achieved a better predictive efficacy for LVI than either of them alone. • The proposed nomogram achieved a favorable prediction of LVI in IDC patients with AUCs of 0.919 and 0.863 in the training and validation datasets, respectively. • The radiomics model could classify patients into high- and low-risk groups with significant differences in DFS.",,,"The fusion radiomics signature of the T2WI, cT1WI, and ADC maps achieved a better predictive efficacy for LVI than either of them alone.

We conducted a retrospective analysis of prospectively and systematically collected data from January 2010 to December 2018 in the French Hospital Discharge Database. We used ICD-10 code ""N820"" to identify new VVF diagnoses. VVF incidence was calculated using estimations of the French population. We compared age on diagnosis, medical history of pelvic tumoral disease, radiotherapy, hysterectomy and childbirth, according to three subgroups: surgical repair attempt (SRA), long-term catheter and/or nephrostomies (LTC) or immediate surgical urinary diversion (ISUD). We focused on the patients diagnosed in 2017 to better analyse VVF aetiologies and outcomes (7-year hindsight and 1 year of follow-up). Chi-squared and Kruskal-Wallis tests were, respectively, used for qualitative and quantitative data comparisons.
Of the 196 million hospital stays out of 50 million French citizens hospitalised from 2010 to 2018, 5499 women were hospitalised for VVF. The estimated incidence of VVF was 2.3/100,000 women-year. Approximately half of the patients underwent SRA (48.4%); 39.8% had LTC and 11.9% had ISUD. Patients were younger in the SRA subgroup (53.4 ± 14.7 years p < 0.001) with a lower rate of pelvic cancer (p < 0.001) or radiotherapy (p < 0.001) and a higher rate of hysterectomies (p > 0.001). In 2017, two-thirds of the VVF diagnosed were secondary to pelvic surgery. Mean management time was 9.2 ± 10.6 months. After SRA, 5.4% underwent incontinence surgery and 5.0% underwent secondary surgical urinary diversion.

35050402,Oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy rather than fluorouracil-based chemotherapy in rectal cancer is more efficient to decrease distant metastasis and increase survival after preoperative chemoradiotherapy and surgery: a meta-analysis.,"['Adjuvant chemotherapy', 'Metastasis', 'Rectal cancer', 'Recurrence', 'Survival']",International journal of colorectal disease,"The standard treatment of stage II-III rectal cancer is preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT), followed by total mesorectal excision (TME). However, the rate of metastasis is still high following this treatment. Therefore, several adjuvant chemotherapy studies have been conducted on reducing subsequent metastases and increasing survival, although there are still no definite conclusions.
We searched for published prospective randomized controlled trials comparing adjuvant chemotherapy regimens following standard preoperative CRT and curative surgery in stage II-III rectal cancer. We systematically searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for relevant trials done from January 2004 to January 2021. Review Manager (RevMan, version 5.3) was used to analyze the data.
We initially searched 1955 studies. We screened and carefully selected four randomized controlled trials with 2897 patients. Compared to the 5-FU-based regimen group, the oxaliplatin-added regimen group attained a higher 3-year locoregional control rate (relative risk [RR] of 0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-0.86; p = 0.003) and 3-year distant metastasis control rate (RR of 0.82, 95% CI, 0.71-0.95; p = 0.007). The oxaliplatin-added regimen group had significantly increased 3-year disease-free survival with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.74-0.97, p = 0.020), but not overall survival (p = 0.740). Grade 3 or higher acute toxicity rates did not differ between the two groups (p = 0.190).

35050387,The ARISCAT score is a promising model to predict postoperative pulmonary complications after major emergency abdominal surgery: an external validation in a Danish cohort.,"['Abdominal surgery', 'Emergency surgery', 'Laparotomy', 'Postoperative pulmonary complications']",European journal of trauma and emergency surgery : official publication of the European Trauma Society,"Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) occur in up to 30% of patients undergoing surgery and are a significant contributor to the overall risk of surgery. A preoperative risk prediction tool for postoperative pulmonary complications could succour clinical identification of patients at increased risk and support clinical decision making. This original study aimed to externally validate a risk model for predicting postoperative pulmonary complications (ARISCAT) in a cohort of patients undergoing major emergency abdominal surgery at a Danish University Hospital.
ARISCAT was validated prospectively in a cohort of patients undergoing major emergency abdominal surgery between March 2017 and January 2019. Predicted PPCs by ARISCAT were compared with observed PPCs. ARISCAT was validated with calibration, discrimination and accuracy and in adherence to the TRIPOD statement.
The study included a total of 585 patients with a median age of 70 years. The majority of patients underwent emergency laparotomy without bowel resection. The predicted PPC frequency by ARISCAT was 24.9%, while the observed frequency of PPCs in the cohort was 36.1%. The slope of the calibration plot was 0.9546, the y axis interception was 0.1269 and the plot was well fitted to a linear slope. The Hosmer Lemeshow goodness-of-fit analysis showed good calibration (p > 0.25). ARISCAT showed good discrimination with AUC 0.83 (95% CI 0.79-0.86) on a receiver-operating characteristics curve and the accuracy was also good with a Brier score of 0.19.

35050362,Associations of Daily Steps and Step Intensity With Incident Diabetes in a Prospective Cohort Study of Older Women: The OPACH Study.,[],Diabetes care,"The primary aim was to assess associations between total steps per day and incident diabetes, whereas the secondary aim was to assess whether the intensity and/or cadence of steps is associated with incident diabetes.
Women without physician-diagnosed diabetes (n = 4,838; mean [SD] age 78.9 [6.7] years) were followed up to 6.9 years; 395 developed diabetes. Hip-worn ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometers worn for 1 week enabled measures of total, light-intensity, and moderate- to vigorous-intensity (MV-intensity) steps per day. Using Cox proportional hazards analysis we modeled adjusted change in the hazard rate for incident diabetes associated with total, light-intensity, and MV-intensity steps per day. We further estimated the proportion of the steps-diabetes association mediated by BMI.
On average, participants took 3,729 (SD 2,114) steps/day, of which 1,875 (791) were light-intensity steps and 1,854 ± 1,762 were MV-intensity. More steps per day were associated with a lower hazard rate for incident diabetes. Confounder-adjusted models for a 2,000 steps/day increment yielded hazard ratio (HR) 0.88 (95% CI 0.78-1.00; P = 0.046). After further adjustment for BMI, HR was 0.90 (95% CI 0.80-1.02; P = 0.11). BMI did not significantly mediate the steps-diabetes association (proportion mediated = 17.7% [95% CI -55.0 to 142.0]; P = 0.09]). The relationship between MV-intensity steps per day (HR 0.86 [95% CI 0.74-1.00]; P = 0.04) and incident diabetes was stronger than for light-intensity steps per day (HR 0.97 [95% CI 0.73-1.29]; P = 0.84).
These findings suggest that for older adults, more steps per day are associated with lower incident diabetes and MV-intensity steps are most strongly associated with a lower hazard of diabetes. This evidence supports that regular stepping is an important risk factor for type 2 diabetes prevention in older adults.",,,"On average, participants took 3,729 (SD 2,114) steps/day, of which 1,875 (791) were light-intensity steps and 1,854 ± 1,762 were MV-intensity.

35050355,Effect of Urolithin A Supplementation on Muscle Endurance and Mitochondrial Health in Older Adults: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,[],JAMA network open,"Aging is associated with a decline in mitochondrial function and reduced exercise capacity. Urolithin A is a natural gut microbiome-derived food metabolite that has been shown to stimulate mitophagy and improve muscle function in older animals and to induce mitochondrial gene expression in older humans.
To investigate whether oral administration of urolithin A improved the 6-minute walk distance, muscle endurance in hand and leg muscles, and biomarkers associated with mitochondrial and cellular health.
This double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial in adults aged 65 to 90 years was conducted at a medical center and a cancer research center in Seattle, Washington, from March 1, 2018, to July 30, 2020. Muscle fatigue tests and plasma analysis of biomarkers were assessed at baseline, 2 months, and 4 months. Six-minute walk distance and maximal ATP production were assessed using magnetic resonance spectroscopy at baseline and at the end of study at 4 months. The analysis used an intention-to-treat approach.
Participants were randomized to receive daily oral supplementation with either 1000 mg urolithin A or placebo for 4 months.
The primary end point was change from baseline in the 6-minute walk distance and change from baseline to 4 months in maximal ATP production in the hand skeletal muscle. The secondary end points were change in muscle endurance of 2 skeletal muscles (tibialis anterior [TA] in the leg and first dorsal interosseus [FDI] in the hand). Cellular health biomarkers were investigated via plasma metabolomics. Adverse events were recorded and compared between the 2 groups during the intervention period.
A total of 66 participants were randomized to either the urolithin A (n = 33) or the placebo (n = 33) intervention group. These participants had a mean (SD) age of 71.7 (4.94) years, were predominantly women (50 [75.8%]), and were all White individuals. Urolithin A, compared with placebo, significantly improved muscle endurance (ie, increase in the number of muscle contractions until fatigue from baseline) in the FDI and TA at 2 months (urolithin A: FDI, 95.3 [115.5] and TA, 41.4 [65.5]; placebo: FDI, 11.6 [147.4] and TA, 5.7 [127.1]). Plasma levels of several acylcarnitines, ceramides, and C-reactive protein were decreased by urolithin A, compared with placebo, at 4 months (baseline vs 4 mo: urolithin A, 2.14 [2.15] vs 2.07 [1.46]; placebo, 2.17 [2.52] vs 2.65 [1.86]). The mean (SD) increase from baseline in the 6-minute walk distance was 60.8 (67.2) m in the urolithin A group and 42.5 (73.3) m in the placebo group. The mean (SD) change from baseline to 4 months in maximal ATP production in the FDI was 0.07 (0.23) mM/s in the urolithin A group and 0.06 (0.20) mM/s in the placebo group; for the TA, it was -0.03 (0.10) mM/s in the urolithin A group and 0.03 (0.10) mM/s in the placebo group. These results showed no significant improvement with urolithin A supplementation compared with placebo. No statistical differences in adverse events were observed between the 2 groups.
This randomized clinical trial found that urolithin A supplementation was safe and well tolerated in the assessed population. Although the improvements in the 6-minute walk distance and maximal ATP production in the hand muscle were not significant in the urolithin A group vs the placebo group, long-term urolithin A supplementation was beneficial for muscle endurance and plasma biomarkers, suggesting that urolithin A may counteract age-associated muscle decline; however, future work is needed to confirm this finding.

35050353,Lung Cancer Screening by Race and Ethnicity in an Integrated Health System in Hawaii.,[],JAMA network open,"Racial and ethnic differences in lung cancer screening (LCS) completion and follow-up may be associated with lung cancer incidence and mortality rates among high-risk populations. Aggregation of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander racial and ethnic groups may mask the true underlying disparities in screening uptake and diagnostic follow-up, creating barriers for targeted, preventive health care.
To examine racial and ethnic differences in LCS completion and follow-up rates in a multiethnic population.
This population-based cohort study was conducted at a health maintenance organization in Hawaii. LCS program participants were identified using electronic medical records from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2019. Study eligibility requirements included being aged 55 to 79 years, a 30 pack-year smoking history, a current smoker or having quit within the past 15 years, at least 5 years past any lung cancer diagnosis and treatment, and cancer free. Data analysis was performed from June 2019 to October 2020.
Eligible for LCS.
Screening rates were analyzed by self-reported race and ethnicity and completion of a low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) test. Diagnostic follow-up results were based on the Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) staging system.
A total of 1030 eligible LCS program members had an order placed; their mean (SD) age was 65.5 (5.8) years, and 633 (61%) were men. The largest racial and ethnic groups were non-Hispanic White (381 participants [37.0%]), Native Hawaiian or part Native Hawaiian (186 participants [18.1%]), and Japanese (146 participants [14.2%]). Men and Filipino, Chinese, Japanese, and non-Hispanic White individuals had a higher proportion of screen orders for LDCT compared with women and individuals of the other racial and ethnic groups. The overall LCS completion rate was 81% (838 participants). There was a 14% to 15% screening completion rate gap among groups. Asian individuals had the highest screening completion rate (266 participants [86%]) followed by Native Hawaiian (149 participants [80%]) and non-Hispanic White individuals (305 participants [80%]), Pacific Islander (50 participants [79%]) individuals, and individuals of other racial and ethnic groups (68 participants [77%]). Within Asian subgroups, Korean (31 participants [94%]) and Japanese (129 participants [88%]) individuals had the highest completion rates followed by Chinese individuals (28 participants [82%]) and Filipino individuals (78 participants [79%]). Of the 54 participants with Lung-RADS stage 3 disease, 93% (50 participants) completed a 6-month surveillance LDCT test; of 37 individuals with Lung-RADS stage 4 disease, 35 (97%) were followed-up for additional procedures.
This cohort study found racial and ethnic disparities in LCS completion rates after disaggregation of Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and Asian individuals and their subgroups. These findings suggest that future research is needed to understand factors that may be associated with LCS completion and follow-up behaviors among these racial and ethnic groups.",,,,,10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.44381,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Oshiro', 'firstname': 'Caryn E S', 'initials': 'CES', 'affiliation': 'Kaiser Permanente Hawaii, Center for Integrated Health Care Research Honolulu, Hawaii.'}, {'lastname': 'Frankland', 'firstname': 'Timothy B', 'initials': 'TB', 'affiliation': 'Kaiser Permanente Hawaii, Center for Integrated Health Care Research Honolulu, Hawaii.'}, {'lastname': 'Mor', 'firstname': 'Joanne', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Kaiser Permanente Hawaii, Center for Integrated Health Care Research Honolulu, Hawaii.'}, {'lastname': 'Wong', 'firstname': 'Carmen P', 'initials': 'CP', 'affiliation': 'Kaiser Permanente Hawaii, Center for Integrated Health Care Research Honolulu, Hawaii.'}, {'lastname': 'Martinez', 'firstname': 'Yannica Theda', 'initials': 'YT', 'affiliation': 'Kaiser Permanente Hawaii, Center for Integrated Health Care Research Honolulu, Hawaii.'}, {'lastname': 'Aruga', 'firstname': 'Cheryl K K', 'initials': 'CKK', 'affiliation': 'Kaiser Permanente Hawaii, Hawaii Permanente Medical Group Honolulu, Honolulu, Hawaii.'}, {'lastname': 'Honda', 'firstname': 'Stacey', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Kaiser Permanente Hawaii, Center for Integrated Health Care Research Honolulu, Hawaii.\nKaiser Permanente Hawaii, Hawaii Permanente Medical Group Honolulu, Honolulu, Hawaii.'}]"
35050348,Use of Fluoro-[18F]-Deoxy-2-D-Glucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography to Predict Immunotherapy Treatment Response in Patients With Squamous Cell Oral Cavity Cancers.,[],JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery,"Neoadjuvant immunotherapy is a novel approach with the potential to improve outcomes for patients with oral cavity squamous cell cancer (OCSCC). Adverse events of varying severity are reported with immunotherapy, and a biomarker to predict response would be clinically useful to avoid toxic effects in those unlikely to benefit.
To correlate changes on fluoro-[18F]-deoxy-2-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) scans with primary tumor pathologic response and immunologic biomarkers in patients with OCSCC receiving neoadjuvant immunotherapy.
This was a retrospective analysis of serial FDG-PET/CT scans obtained prospectively as part of a phase 2 open-label randomized clinical trial investigating neoadjuvant immunotherapy in patients with untreated OCSCC between 2016 and 2019. Included were a total of 29 patients from a single academic medical center with untreated OCSCC (≥T2, or clinically node positive) randomized 1:1 to receive neoadjuvant therapy with single agent nivolumab or combination nivolumab and ipilimumab followed by surgery and standard of care adjuvant therapy.
The interventions in this study were FDG-PET/CT scans before (T0) and after (T1) preoperative immunotherapy.
Data collected from FDG-PET/CT scans included maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of primary OCSCC and cervical lymph nodes (LNs) at T0 and T1 and new LN uptake and uptake consistent with radiologic immune-related adverse events (irAEs) at T1. Primary OCSCC pathologic response reported as percentages of viable vs nonviable tumor. The number of CD8+ cells/mm2 was determined in the primary tumor biopsy specimen and at surgery.
There was no correlation between pathologic response and change in SUVmax in the primary OCSCC between T0 and T1. Out of 27 total participants, 13 had newly FDG-avid ipsilateral LNs at T1, most negative on pathology. A total of 9 had radiologic irAEs, most commonly sarcoid-like LN (7 of 27). No correlations were found between primary OCSCC SUVmax at T0 and CD8+ T-cell number in the primary tumor biopsy, and no correlations were found between primary OCSCC SUVmax at T1 and CD8+ T-cell number in the primary tumor at surgery.
There were no correlations between changes in FDG uptake after neoadjuvant immunotherapy and pathologic primary tumor response. Importantly, newly FDG-avid ipsilateral LNs following neoadjuvant immunotherapy were commonly observed but did not represent progressive disease or indicate pathologically disease positive nodes in most cases. These findings argue against altering surgical plans in this setting and suggest that the role of FDG-PET/CT may be limited as an early imaging biomarker for predicting pathologic response to preoperative immunotherapy for OCSCC.

35050342,Evaluation of Substantial Reduction in Elective Radiotherapy Dose and Field in Patients With Human Papillomavirus-Associated Oropharyngeal Carcinoma Treated With Definitive Chemoradiotherapy.,[],JAMA oncology,"Several de-escalation strategies for human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) have focused on deintensifying gross disease treatment. Reduction of radiotherapy dose and target volume to subclinical regions may achieve good clinical outcomes with favorable patient quality of life (QOL).
To determine outcomes from a systematic approach of reducing radiotherapy dose and target volume to the elective treatment regions in patients with HPV-associated OPC undergoing concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT).
This retrospective cohort study included 276 consecutive patients with HPV-positive OPC receiving CCRT from March 1, 2017, to July 31, 2019. Data were analyzed from February 23 to September 13, 2021.
Elective nodal and subclinical regions received 30 Gy of radiotherapy in 15 fractions, followed by a cone down of 40 Gy in 20 fractions to gross disease for a total dose of 70 Gy. The high retropharyngeal nodal basins in the node-negative neck and bilateral levels IB and V basins were omitted.
Patients were followed up to evaluate locoregional control as the primary outcome and distant metastasis-free survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival as secondary outcomes. Quality-of-life data were obtained at each visit when feasible.
Among the 276 patients included in the analysis, the median age was 61 (range, 36-87) years; 247 (89.5%) were men; and 183 (66.3%) had less than 10 pack-years of smoking history. Most patients (251 [90.9%]) were White. Overall, 87 (31.5%) had cT3-cT4 disease and 65 (23.5%) had cN2-cN3 disease per the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual. One hundred seventy-two patients (62.3%) completed 300-mg/m2 high-dose cisplatin therapy. During a median follow-up of 26 (range, 21-32) months, 8 patients developed locoregional recurrence, including 7 at the primary site or gross nodes that received a total dose of 70 Gy and 1 with a persistent node not previously identified as gross disease that received a total dose of only 30 Gy. The 24-month locoregional control was 97.0%; progression-free survival, 88.0%; distant metastasis-free survival, 95.2%; and overall survival, 95.1%. During treatment, 17 patients (6.2%) required a feeding tube. At 24 months, most of the QOL composite scores (jaw-related problems, pain, social contact, eating, speech, and swallow) were comparable or superior to baseline measures except for senses, dry mouth, muscular tension, and cognitive functioning, which improved over time but remained marginally worse than baseline.
This cohort study found that the evaluated de-escalation strategy for elective regions showed favorable clinical outcomes and QOL profiles.

However, to our knowledge, the association of multiprofessional preoperative assessment, information, and briefing with postoperative outcomes has not been evaluated.
To compare postoperative complications, length of hospital stay (LOS), readmissions, mortality, and costs per case among patients undergoing complex oncologic HNC surgery before and after the implementation of a comprehensive preoperative multiprofessional assessment and information day (MUPAID).
This retrospective, single-center case-control study was conducted at a tertiary referral head and neck anticancer center/university cancer institute and compared patients with HNC who were undergoing complex oncological surgeries between January 2012 and July 2018 before (control group) and after (intervention group) implementation of the institutional MUPAID. Data analysis was conducted between 2019 and 2020. The intervention group comprised patients who participated in the MUPAID beginning in February 2015. These patients were assessed by a multiprofessional team and provided with structured and comprehensive information on the surgical procedure and its functional, social, financial, and psychological effects, as well as the postoperative care, rehabilitation, and follow-up period. Patients in the control group had also undergone complex oncologic HNC surgery and were selected through surgical procedure codes.
The end points were postoperative rate and severity of complications, LOS, readmissions, mortality, and costs per case.
The study included 161 patients, 81 in the intervention (25 women [30.9%]) and 80 in the control group (18 women [22.5%]). The groups showed no relevant differences in sociodemographic, disease, and procedural characteristics. The intervention cohort presented with fewer major local and systemic complications (Clavien-Dindo score, III-V: 34.6% vs 52.5%; difference proportion, -0.179; 95% CI, -0.33 to -0.03), shorter median LOS (12 days [IQR, 10-16 days] vs 16 days [IQR, 11-20] days; effect size, 0.482; 95% CI Cohen d, 0.152-0.812) and decreased median charge per case ($50 848 [IQR, $42 510-$63 479] vs $69 602 [IQR, $45 631-$96 280]; effect size, 0.534; 95% CI Cohen d, 0.22-0.85).
The results of this case-control study suggest that MUPAID for patients who are undergoing complex oncologic HNC surgery is associated with shortened LOS and costs per case as well as decreased complications severity. These results are promising on a patient level in the potential to minimize individual treatment burden, as well as on an institutional and health care system level in the potential significant optimization of surgical outcomes and financial aspects.",,,,,10.1001/jamaoto.2021.4048,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Schmid', 'firstname': 'Manuela', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Nursing, Medical-Technical and Medical-Therapeutic Areas, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Giger', 'firstname': 'Roland', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Nisa', 'firstname': 'Lluís', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Mueller', 'firstname': 'Simon Andreas', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Schubert', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'School of Health Professions, Zurich University of Applied Science, Winterthur, Switzerland.\nInstitute of Nursing Science, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.'}, {'lastname': 'Schubert', 'firstname': 'Adrian Daniel', 'initials': 'AD', 'affiliation': 'Department of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.'}]"
35050320,Early Readout on Overall Survival of Patients With Melanoma Treated With Immunotherapy Using a Novel Imaging Analysis.,[],JAMA oncology,"Existing criteria to estimate the benefit of a therapy in patients with cancer rely almost exclusively on tumor size, an approach that was not designed to estimate survival benefit and is challenged by the unique properties of immunotherapy. More accurate prediction of survival by treatment could enhance treatment decisions.
To validate, using radiomics and machine learning, the performance of a signature of quantitative computed tomography (CT) imaging features for estimating overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced melanoma treated with immunotherapy.
This prognostic study used radiomics and machine learning to retrospectively analyze CT images obtained at baseline and first follow-up and their associated clinical metadata. Data were prospectively collected in the KEYNOTE-002 (Study of Pembrolizumab [MK-3475] Versus Chemotherapy in Participants With Advanced Melanoma; 2017 analysis) and KEYNOTE-006 (Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Two Different Dosing Schedules of Pembrolizumab [MK-3475] Compared to Ipilimumab in Participants With Advanced Melanoma; 2016 analysis) multicenter clinical trials. Participants included 575 patients with a diagnosis of advanced melanoma who were randomly assigned to training and validation sets. Data for the present study were collected from November 20, 2012, to June 3, 2019, and analyzed from July 1, 2019, to September 15, 2021.
KEYNOTE-002 featured trial groups testing intravenous pembrolizumab, 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg every 2 or every 3 weeks based on randomization, or investigator-choice chemotherapy; KEYNOTE-006 featured trial groups testing intravenous ipilimumab, 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks and intravenous pembrolizumab, 10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks based on randomization.
The performance of the signature CT imaging features for estimating OS at the month 6 posttreatment landmark in patients who received pembrolizumab was measured using an area under the time-dependent receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC).
A random forest model combined 25 imaging features extracted from tumors segmented on CT images to identify the combination (signature) that best estimated OS with pembrolizumab in 575 patients. The signature combined 4 imaging features, 2 related to tumor size and 2 reflecting changes in tumor imaging phenotype. In the validation set (287 patients treated with pembrolizumab), the signature reached an AUC for estimation of OS status of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.89-0.95). The standard method, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1, achieved an AUC of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.75-0.84) and classified tumor outcomes as partial or complete response (93 of 287 [32.4%]), stable disease (90 of 287 [31.3%]), or progressive disease (104 of 287 [36.2%]).
The findings of this prognostic study suggest that the radiomic signature discerned from conventional CT images at baseline and on first follow-up may be used in clinical settings to provide an accurate early readout of future OS probability in patients with melanoma treated with single-agent programmed cell death 1 blockade.",,,,,10.1001/jamaoncol.2021.6818,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Dercle', 'firstname': 'Laurent', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.\nDepartment of Radiology, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhao', 'firstname': 'Binsheng', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.\nDepartment of Radiology, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York.'}, {'lastname': 'Gönen', 'firstname': 'Mithat', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.'}, {'lastname': 'Moskowitz', 'firstname': 'Chaya S', 'initials': 'CS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.'}, {'lastname': 'Firas', 'firstname': 'Ahmed', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.\nDepartment of Radiology, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York.'}, {'lastname': 'Beylergil', 'firstname': 'Volkan', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.\nDepartment of Radiology, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York.'}, {'lastname': 'Connors', 'firstname': 'Dana E', 'initials': 'DE', 'affiliation': 'Foundation for the National Institutes of Health, North Bethesda, Maryland.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Hao', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.\nDepartment of Radiology, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York.'}, {'lastname': 'Lu', 'firstname': 'Lin', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.\nDepartment of Radiology, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York.'}, {'lastname': 'Fojo', 'firstname': 'Tito', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Columbia University Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, New York, New York.'}, {'lastname': 'Carvajal', 'firstname': 'Richard', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Columbia University Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center, New York, New York.'}, {'lastname': 'Karovic', 'firstname': 'Sanja', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Inova Center for Personalized Health and Schar Cancer Institute, Fairfax, Virginia.'}, {'lastname': 'Maitland', 'firstname': 'Michael L', 'initials': 'ML', 'affiliation': 'Inova Center for Personalized Health and Schar Cancer Institute, Fairfax, Virginia.\nUniversity of Virginia Cancer Center, Charlottesville.'}, {'lastname': 'Goldmacher', 'firstname': 'Gregory V', 'initials': 'GV', 'affiliation': 'Merck & Co, Inc, Kenilworth, New Jersey.'}, {'lastname': 'Oxnard', 'firstname': 'Geoffrey R', 'initials': 'GR', 'affiliation': 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.'}, {'lastname': 'Postow', 'firstname': 'Michael A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.\nDepartment of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.'}, {'lastname': 'Schwartz', 'firstname': 'Lawrence H', 'initials': 'LH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York.\nDepartment of Radiology, New York Presbyterian Hospital, New York, New York.'}]"

35050310,Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines for Extramammary Paget Disease.,[],JAMA oncology,"Extramammary Paget disease (EMPD) is a frequently recurring malignant neoplasm with metastatic potential that presents in older adults on the genital, perianal, and axillary skin. Extramammary Paget disease can precede or occur along with internal malignant neoplasms.
To develop recommendations for the care of adults with EMPD.
A systematic review of the literature on EMPD from January 1990 to September 18, 2019, was conducted using MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, and Cochrane Libraries. Analysis included 483 studies. A multidisciplinary expert panel evaluation of the findings led to the development of clinical care recommendations for EMPD.
The key findings were as follows: (1) Multiple skin biopsies, including those of any nodular areas, are critical for diagnosis. (2) Malignant neoplasm screening appropriate for age and anatomical site should be performed at baseline to distinguish between primary and secondary EMPD. (3) Routine use of sentinel lymph node biopsy or lymph node dissection is not recommended. (4) For intraepidermal EMPD, surgical and nonsurgical treatments may be used depending on patient and tumor characteristics, although cure rates may be superior with surgical approaches. For invasive EMPD, surgical resection with curative intent is preferred. (5) Patients with unresectable intraepidermal EMPD or patients who are medically unable to undergo surgery may receive nonsurgical treatments, including radiotherapy, imiquimod, photodynamic therapy, carbon dioxide laser therapy, or other modalities. (6) Distant metastatic disease may be treated with chemotherapy or individualized targeted approaches. (7) Close follow-up to monitor for recurrence is recommended for at least the first 5 years.
Clinical practice guidelines for EMPD provide guidance regarding recommended diagnostic approaches, differentiation between invasive and noninvasive disease, and use of surgical vs nonsurgical treatments. Prospective registries may further improve our understanding of the natural history of the disease in primary vs secondary EMPD, clarify features of high-risk tumors, and identify superior management approaches.",,,,,10.1001/jamaoncol.2021.7148,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Kibbi', 'firstname': 'Nour', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Redwood City, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Owen', 'firstname': 'Joshua L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Dermatology Service, South Texas Veterans Health Care System, San Antonio.'}, {'lastname': 'Worley', 'firstname': 'Brandon', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Florida Dermatology and Skin Cancer Centers, Lake Wales.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Jake X', 'initials': 'JX', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.'}, {'lastname': 'Harikumar', 'firstname': 'Vishnu', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.'}, {'lastname': 'Downing', 'firstname': 'Malia B', 'initials': 'MB', 'affiliation': 'Division of Dermatology, University of Kansas, Kansas City.'}, {'lastname': 'Aasi', 'firstname': 'Sumaira Z', 'initials': 'SZ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Redwood City, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Aung', 'firstname': 'Phyu P', 'initials': 'PP', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology (Dermatopathology), The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.'}, {'lastname': 'Barker', 'firstname': 'Christopher A', 'initials': 'CA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.'}, {'lastname': 'Bolotin', 'firstname': 'Diana', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Section of Dermatology, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois.'}, {'lastname': 'Bordeaux', 'firstname': 'Jeremy S', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, Department of Dermatology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.'}, {'lastname': 'Cartee', 'firstname': 'Todd V', 'initials': 'TV', 'affiliation': 'Division of Dermatology, Pennsylvania State College of Medicine, Hershey.'}, {'lastname': 'Chandra', 'firstname': 'Sunandana', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Northwestern University Medical Center, Chicago, Illinois.'}, {'lastname': 'Cho', 'firstname': 'Nancy L', 'initials': 'NL', 'affiliation': ""Department of Surgery, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard University, Boston, Massachusetts.""}, {'lastname': 'Choi', 'firstname': 'Jennifer N', 'initials': 'JN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.'}, {'lastname': 'Chung', 'firstname': 'Kee Yang', 'initials': 'KY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Cliby', 'firstname': 'William A', 'initials': 'WA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.'}, {'lastname': 'Dorigo', 'firstname': 'Oliver', 'initials': 'O', 'affiliation': ""Division of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Stanford Women's Cancer Center, Cancer Institute, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California.""}, {'lastname': 'Eisen', 'firstname': 'Daniel B', 'initials': 'DB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology, University of California Davis, Sacramento.'}, {'lastname': 'Fujisawa', 'firstname': 'Yasuhiro', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Golda', 'firstname': 'Nicholas', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology, University of Missouri School of Medicine, Columbia.'}, {'lastname': 'Halfdanarson', 'firstname': 'Thorvardur R', 'initials': 'TR', 'affiliation': 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.'}, {'lastname': 'Iavazzo', 'firstname': 'Christos', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Gynecologic Oncology, Metaxa Cancer Hospital, Piraeus, Greece.'}, {'lastname': 'Jiang', 'firstname': 'Shang I Brian', 'initials': 'SIB', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology, University of California San Diego, San Diego.'}, {'lastname': 'Kanitakis', 'firstname': 'Jean', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Dermatology, Ed.

35050303,Interplay Between Duration of Androgen Deprivation Therapy and External Beam Radiotherapy With or Without a Brachytherapy Boost for Optimal Treatment of High-risk Prostate Cancer: A Patient-Level Data Analysis of 3 Cohorts.,[],JAMA oncology,"Radiotherapy combined with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a standard of care for high-risk prostate cancer. However, the interplay between radiotherapy dose and the required minimum duration of ADT is uncertain.
To determine the specific ADT duration threshold that provides a distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) benefit in patients with high-risk prostate cancer receiving external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or EBRT with a brachytherapy boost (EBRT+BT).
This was a cohort study of 3 cohorts assembled from a multicenter retrospective study (2000-2013); a post hoc analysis of the Randomized Androgen Deprivation and Radiotherapy 03/04 (RADAR; 2003-2007) randomized clinical trial (RCT); and a cross-trial comparison of the RADAR vs the Deprivación Androgénica y Radio Terapía (Androgen Deprivation and Radiation Therapy; DART) 01/05 RCT (2005-2010). In all, the study analyzed 1827 patients treated with EBRT and 1108 patients treated with EBRT+BT from the retrospective cohort; 181 treated with EBRT and 203 with EBRT+BT from RADAR; and 91 patients treated with EBRT from DART. The study was conducted from October 15, 2020, to July 1, 2021, and the data analyses, from January 5 to June 15, 2021.
High-dose EBRT or EBRT+BT for an ADT duration determined by patient-physician choice (retrospective) or by randomization (RCTs).
The primary outcome was DMFS; secondary outcome was overall survival (OS). Natural cubic spline analysis identified minimum thresholds (months).
This cohort study of 3 studies totaling 3410 men (mean age [SD], 68 [62-74] years; race and ethnicity not collected) with high-risk prostate cancer found a significant interaction between the treatment type (EBRT vs EBRT+BT) and ADT duration (binned to <6, 6 to <18, and ≥18 months). Natural cubic spline analysis identified minimum duration thresholds of 26.3 months (95% CI, 25.4-36.0 months) for EBRT and 12 months (95% CI, 4.9-36.0 months) for EBRT+BT for optimal effect on DMFS. In RADAR, the prolongation of ADT for patients receiving only EBRT was not associated with significant improvements in DMFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 95% CI, 0.65-1.57); however, for patients receiving EBRT+BT, a longer duration was associated with improved DMFS (DMFS HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.36-0.87; P = .01). For patients receiving EBRT alone (DART), 28 months of ADT was associated with improved DMFS compared with 18 months (RADAR HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.17-0.80; P = .01).
These cohort study findings suggest that the optimal minimum ADT duration for treatment with high-dose EBRT alone is more than 18 months; and for EBRT+BT, it is 18 months or possibly less. Additional studies are needed to determine more precise minimum durations.",,,,,10.1001/jamaoncol.2021.6871,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Kishan', 'firstname': 'Amar U', 'initials': 'AU', 'affiliation':

35050301,Interplay of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors in organ-specific vessel maintenance.,[],The Journal of experimental medicine,"Vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) and their receptors (VEGFRs) are quintessential for the development and maintenance of blood and lymphatic vessels. However, genetic interactions between the VEGFRs are poorly understood. VEGFR2 is the dominant receptor that is required for the growth and survival of the endothelium, whereas deletion of VEGFR1 or VEGFR3 was reported to induce vasculature overgrowth. Here we show that vascular regression induced by VEGFR2 deletion in postnatal and adult mice is aggravated by additional deletion of VEGFR1 or VEGFR3 in the intestine, kidney, and pancreas, but not in the liver or kidney glomeruli. In the adult mice, hepatic and intestinal vessels regressed within a few days after gene deletion, whereas vessels in skin and retina remained stable for at least four weeks. Our results show changes in endothelial transcriptomes and organ-specific vessel maintenance mechanisms that are dependent on VEGFR signaling pathways and reveal previously unknown functions of VEGFR1 and VEGFR3 in endothelial cells.",,,,© 2022 Karaman et al.,10.1084/jem.20210565,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Karaman', 'firstname': 'Sinem', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Wihuri Research Institute, Biomedicum Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.\nTranslational Cancer Medicine Research Program, Faculty of Medicine, Biomedicum Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.\nIndividualized Drug Therapy Research Program, Faculty of Medicine, Biomedicum Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Paavonsalo', 'firstname': 'Satu', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Wihuri Research Institute, Biomedicum Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.\nTranslational Cancer Medicine Research Program, Faculty of Medicine, Biomedicum Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.\nIndividualized Drug Therapy Research Program, Faculty of Medicine, Biomedicum Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Heinolainen', 'firstname': 'Krista', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Wihuri Research Institute, Biomedicum Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.\nTranslational Cancer Medicine Research Program, Faculty of Medicine, Biomedicum Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Lackman', 'firstname': 'Madeleine H', 'initials': 'MH', 'affiliation': 'Individualized Drug Therapy Research Program, Faculty of Medicine, Biomedicum Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Ranta', 'firstname': 'Amanda', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Wihuri Research Institute, Biomedicum Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.\nTranslational Cancer Medicine Research Program, Faculty of Medicine, Biomedicum Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Hemanthakumar', 'firstname': 'Karthik A', 'initials': 'KA', 'affiliation': 'Wihuri Research Institute, Biomedicum Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Kubota', 'firstname': 'Yoshiaki', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anatomy, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Alitalo', 'firstname': 'Kari', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Wihuri Research Institute, Biomedicum Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.\nTranslational Cancer Medicine Research Program, Faculty of Medicine, Biomedicum Helsinki, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.'}]"

Bioorthogonal reactions between a pair of biologically reactive groups can rapidly and specifically take place in a mild physiological milieu without perturbing inherent biochemical processes. Attributed to their high selectivity and efficiency, bioorthogonal reactions can significantly decrease background signals in bioimaging. Compared with metal-catalyzed bioorthogonal click reactions, metal-free click reactions are more biocompatible without the metal catalyst-induced cytotoxicity. Although a great number of bioorthogonal chemistry-based strategies have been reported for cancer theranostics, a comprehensive review is scarce to highlight the advantages of these strategies. In this review, recent progress in cancer theranostics guided by metal-free bioorthogonal click chemistry will be depicted in detail.

We evaluated CSF metabolomic and proteomic profiles based on the compartments and the diagnosis of spinal LM, proved by MRI from 20 paired ventricular and lumbar CSF samples of LM patients, including 12 spinal LM (+) samples. In metabolome analysis, 9512 low-mass ions (LMIs) were identified-7 LMIs were abundant in all lumbar versus paired ventricular CSF samples, and 3 LMIs were significantly abundant in all ventricular CSF. In comparisons between spinal LM (+) CSF and LM (-) CSF, 105 LMIs were discriminative for spinal LM (+) CSF. In proteome analysis, a total of 1536 proteins were measured. A total of 18 proteins, including complement C3, were more highly expressed in all lumbar CSF, compared with paired ventricular CSF, while 82 proteins, including coagulation factor V, were higher in the ventricular CSF. Of 37 discriminative proteins, including uteroglobin and complement component C8 gamma chain, 4 were higher in all spinal LM (+) CSF versus spinal LM (-) CSF. We further evaluated metabolic pathways associated with these discriminative proteins using the Gene Ontology database. We found that 16/17 spinal LM (+) pathways, including complement activation, were associated with lumbar discriminative proteins, whereas only 2 pathways were associated with ventricular-discriminative proteins. In conclusion, we determined that metabolite and protein profiles differed between paired lumbar and ventricular CSF samples. The protein profiles of spinal LM (+) CSF showed more similarity with the lumbar CSF than the ventricular CSF. Thus, we suggest that CSF LMIs and proteins could reflect LM disease activity and that LM-associated differences in CSF are more likely to be present in the lumbar compartment.",,,,,10.3390/metabo12010080,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Kwon', 'firstname': 'Ji-Woong', 'initials': 'JW', 'affiliation': 'Neuro-Oncology Clinic, National Cancer Center, Goyang 10408, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Im', 'firstname': 'Ji Hye', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cancer Control, Graduate School of Cancer Science and Policy, National Cancer Center, Goyang 10408, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Kyue-Yim', 'initials': 'KY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cancer Control, Graduate School of Cancer Science and Policy, National Cancer Center, Goyang 10408, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Yoo', 'firstname': 'Byong Chul', 'initials': 'BC', 'affiliation': 'Cancer Diagnostics Branch, Division of Cancer Biology, Research Institute, National Cancer Center, Goyang 10408, Korea.\nDepartment of Cancer Biomedical Science, Graduate School of Cancer Science and Policy, National Cancer Center, Goyang 10408, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Jun Hwa', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Cancer Diagnostics Branch, Division of Cancer Biology, Research Institute, National Cancer Center, Goyang 10408, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Kyung-Hee', 'initials': 'KH', 'affiliation': 'Cancer Diagnostics Branch, Division of Cancer Biology, Research Institute, National Cancer Center, Goyang 10408, Korea.\nProteomics Core Facility, Research Core Center, Research Institute, National Cancer Center, Goyang 10408, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Jong Heon', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cancer Biomedical Science, Graduate School of Cancer Science and Policy, National Cancer Center, Goyang 10408, Korea.\nCancer Molecular Biology Branch, Division of Cancer Biology, Research Institute, National Cancer Center, Goyang 10408, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Shin', 'firstname': 'Sang Hoon', 'initials': 'SH', 'affiliation': 'Neuro-Oncology Clinic, National Cancer Center, Goyang 10408, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Yoo', 'firstname': 'Heon', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Neuro-Oncology Clinic, National Cancer Center, Goyang 10408, Korea.'}, {'lastname': 'Gwak', 'firstname': 'Ho-Shin', 'initials': 'HS', 'affiliation': 'Neuro-Oncology Clinic, National Cancer Center, Goyang 10408, Korea.\nDepartment of Cancer Control, Graduate School of Cancer Science and Policy, National Cancer Center, Goyang 10408, Korea.'}]"

When measurements of glucose and oxygen utilization by activated neural tissue indicated that glucose was consumed without an accompanied oxygen consumption, the investigators who performed those measurements also termed their discovery 'aerobic glycolysis'. Red blood cells do not contain mitochondria and, therefore, produce their energy needs via glycolysis alone. Other processes within the central nervous system (CNS) and additional organs and tissues (heart, muscle, and so on), such as ion pumps, are also known to utilize glycolysis only for the production of ATP necessary to support their function. Unfortunately, the phenomenon of 'aerobic glycolysis' is an enigma wherever it is encountered, thus several hypotheses have been produced in attempts to explain it; that is, whether it occurs in cancer cells, in activated neural tissue, or during postprandial or exercise metabolism. Here, it is argued that, where the phenomenon in neural tissue is concerned, the prefix 'aerobic' in the term 'aerobic glycolysis' should be removed. Data collected over the past three decades indicate that L-lactate, the end product of the glycolytic pathway, plays an essential role in brain energy metabolism, justifying the elimination of the prefix 'aerobic'. Similar justification is probably appropriate for other tissues as well.",,,,,10.3390/metabo12010072,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Schurr', 'firstname': 'Avital', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY 40202, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Passarella', 'firstname': 'Salvatore', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Human Oncology, University of Bari ""Aldo Moro"", 70124 Bari, Italy.'}]"

We previously conducted urinary metabolomic analyses using capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry and found a significant difference in various metabolites, especially polyamines, between patients with CRC and healthy controls (HC). We analyzed additional samples and confirmed consistency between the newly and previously analyzed data. In total, we included 36 HC, 34 adenoma (AD), and 214 CRC samples, which were used for subsequent analyses. Among the 132 quantified metabolites, 16 exhibited consistent differences in both datasets, which included polyamines, etc. Pathway analyses of the integrated data revealed significant differences in many metabolites, such as glutamine, and metabolites of the TCA (tricarboxylic acid cycle) and urea cycles. The discrimination ability of the combination of multiple metabolites among the three groups was evaluated, which yielded higher sensitivity than tumor markers.

There is continuous and bidirectional communication between gut microbiota and the host, conforming to a unique entity known as ""holobiont"". Among these crosstalk mechanisms, the gut microbiota synthesizes a broad spectrum of bioactive compounds or metabolites which exert pleiotropic effects on the human organism. Many of these microbial metabolites can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) or have significant effects on the brain, playing a key role in the so-called microbiota-gut-brain axis. An altered microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis is a major characteristic of many neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD).

Nevertheless, the significance of the de novo cholesterol synthesis pathway has been controversial in PC, indicating the need to reassess this pathway in PC. We utilized preclinical models and clinical specimens of PC patients and cell lines and utilized mass spectrometry-based sterol analysis. Further, we also performed in silico analysis to corroborate the significance of de novo cholesterol synthesis pathway in PC. Our results demonstrated alteration in free sterol levels, including free cholesterol, across in vitro, in vivo, and clinical specimens of PC. Especially, our sterol analyses established consistent alterations in free cholesterol across the different PC models.

Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) represent a special node that receives signals from the host and the environment and translates them into corresponding responses. Specific molecular communication systems such as metabolites are known to transmit information across the intestinal boundary. The gut microbiota or food-derived metabolites are extrinsic factors that influence the homeostasis of the intestinal epithelium, while mitochondrial and host-derived cellular metabolites determine the identity, fitness, and regenerative capacity of IECs. Little is known, however, about the role of intrinsic and extrinsic metabolites of IECs in the initiation and progression of pathological processes such as inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer as well as about their impact on intestinal immunity. In this review, we will highlight the most recent contributions on the modulatory effects of intestinal metabolites in gut pathophysiology, with a particular focus on metabolites in promoting intestinal inflammation or colorectal tumorigenesis.

Overall, 147 VOMs of several chemistries were identified in the intervention groups-including naphthalene derivatives, phenols, and organosulphurs-augmented in the LC group. In contrast, benzene and terpenic derivatives were found to be more prevalent in the CTRL group. The volatomic data obtained were processed using advanced statistical analysis, namely partial least square discriminative analysis (PLS-DA), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) methods. This resulted in the identification of nine uVOMs with a higher potential to discriminate LC patients from CTRL subjects. These were furan, o-cymene, furfural, linalool oxide, viridiflorene, 2-bromo-phenol, tricyclazole, 4-methyl-phenol, and 1-(4-hydroxy-3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-3-morpholinopropan-1-one. The metabolic pathway analysis of the data obtained identified several altered biochemical pathways in LC mainly affecting glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pyruvate metabolism, and fatty acid biosynthesis. Moreover, acetate and octanoic, decanoic, and dodecanoic fatty acids were identified as the key metabolites responsible for such deregulation. Furthermore, studies involving larger cohorts of LC patients would allow us to consolidate the data obtained and challenge the potential of the uVOMs as candidate biomarkers for LC.",,,,,10.3390/metabo12010036,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Taunk', 'firstname': 'Khushman', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Proteomics Lab, National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Ganeshkhind, SPPU Campus, Pune 411007, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Porto-Figueira', 'firstname': 'Priscilla', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'CQM-Centro de Química da Madeira, Centro de Ciências Exatas e da Engenharia, Universidade da Madeira, Campus Universitário da Penteada, 9020-105 Funchal, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Pereira', 'firstname': 'Jorge A M', 'initials': 'JAM', 'affiliation': 'CQM-Centro de Química da Madeira, Centro de Ciências Exatas e da Engenharia, Universidade da Madeira, Campus Universitário da Penteada, 9020-105 Funchal, Portugal.'}, {'lastname': 'Taware', 'firstname': 'Ravindra', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Proteomics Lab, National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Ganeshkhind, SPPU Campus, Pune 411007, India.'}, {'lastname': 'da Costa', 'firstname': 'Nattane Luíza', 'initials': 'NL', 'affiliation': 'Instituto de Informática, Alameda Palmeiras, Quadra D, Campus Samambaia, Universidade Federal de Goiás, Goiânia 74690-900, GO, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Barbosa', 'firstname': 'Rommel', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Instituto de Informática, Alameda Palmeiras, Quadra D, Campus Samambaia, Universidade Federal de Goiás, Goiânia 74690-900, GO, Brazil.'}, {'lastname': 'Rapole', 'firstname': 'Srikanth', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Proteomics Lab, National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Ganeshkhind, SPPU Campus, Pune 411007, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Câmara', 'firstname': 'José S', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'CQM-Centro de Química da Madeira, Centro de Ciências Exatas e da Engenharia, Universidade da Madeira, Campus Universitário da Penteada, 9020-105 Funchal, Portugal.\nFaculdade de Ciências Exatas e da Engenharia, Universidade da Madeira, Campus Universitário da Penteada, 9020-105 Funchal, Portugal.'}]"

Indeed, between 2008 and 2017, the odds of surviving a major traumatic injury in the UK increased by nineteen percent. However, the improved survival rates of severely-injured patients have placed an increased burden on the healthcare system, with major trauma a common cause of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions that last ≥10 days. Improved understanding of the factors influencing patient outcomes is now urgently needed. We investigated the serum metabolomic profile of fifty-five major trauma patients across three post-injury phases: acute (days 0-4), intermediate (days 5-14) and late (days 15-112). Using ICU length of stay (LOS) as a clinical outcome, we aimed to determine whether the serum metabolome measured at days 0-4 post-injury for patients with an extended (≥10 days) ICU LOS differed from that of patients with a short (<10 days) ICU LOS. In addition, we investigated whether combining metabolomic profiles with clinical scoring systems would generate a variable that would identify patients with an extended ICU LOS with a greater degree of accuracy than models built on either variable alone. The number of metabolites unique to and shared across each time segment varied across acute, intermediate and late segments. A one-way ANOVA revealed the most variation in metabolite levels across the different time-points was for the metabolites lactate, glucose, anserine and 3-hydroxybutyrate. A total of eleven features were selected to differentiate between <10 days ICU LOS vs. >10 days ICU LOS.

We aimed to determine the metabolomic signatures associated with weight control interventions in children with obesity. Forty children from the ""Intervention for Children and Adolescent Obesity via Activity and Nutrition (ICAAN)"" cohort were selected according to intervention responses. Based on changes in body mass index z-scores, 20 were responders and the remaining non-responders. Their serum metabolites were quantitatively analyzed using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry at baseline and after 6 and 18 months of intervention. After 18 months of intervention, the metabolite cluster changes in the responders and non-responders showed a difference on the heatmap, but significant metabolites were not clear. However, regardless of the responses, 13 and 49 metabolites were significant in the group of children with obesity intervention at 6 months and 18 months post-intervention compared to baseline.

Although citrulline and calprotectin have been suggested as AR biomarkers, these have limited clinical value. Using a mouse model of intestinal transplantation (ITx), we performed a proteome-wide analysis and investigated rejection-related proteome changes that may eventually be used as biomarkers. ITx was performed in allogenic (Balb/C to C57Bl) and syngeneic (C57Bl) combinations. Graft samples were obtained three and six days after transplantation (n = 4/time point) and quantitative proteomic analysis with iTRAQ-labeling and mass spectrometry of whole tissue homogenates was performed. Histology showed moderate AR in all allografts post-transplantation at day six. Nine hundred and thirty-eight proteins with at least three unique peptides were identified in the intestinal grafts. Eighty-six proteins varying by >20% between time points and/or groups had an alteration pattern unique to the rejecting allografts: thirty-seven proteins and enzymes (including S100-A8 and IDO-1) were significantly upregulated whereas forty-nine (among other chromogranin, ornithine aminotransferase, and arginase) were downregulated. Numerous proteins showed altered expression during intestinal AR, several of which were previously identified to be involved in acute rejection, although our results also identified previously unreported proteome changes.

Metabolomics studies have recently unraveled changes in metabolite composition in plasma and tissues during aging and have provided critical information to elucidate the molecular basis of the aging process. However, the metabolic changes in tissues responsible for food intake and lipid storage have remained unexplored. In this study, we aimed to investigate aging-related metabolic alterations in these tissues. To fill this gap, we employed NMR-based metabolomics in several tissues, including different parts of the intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum) and brown/white adipose tissues (BAT, WAT), of young (9-10 weeks) and old (96-104 weeks) wild-type (mixed genetic background of 129/J and C57BL/6) mice. We, further, included plasma and skeletal muscle of the same mice to verify previous results. Strikingly, we found that duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and WAT do not metabolically age. In contrast, plasma, skeletal muscle, and BAT show a strong metabolic aging phenotype. Overall, we provide first insights into the metabolic changes of tissues essential for nutrient uptake and lipid storage and have identified biomarkers for metabolites that could be further explored, to study the molecular mechanisms of aging.",,,,,10.3390/metabo12010017,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Qishun', 'initials': 'Q', 'affiliation': 'Gottfried Schatz Research Center for Cell Signaling, Metabolism and Ageing, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Medical University of Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Kerbl-Knapp', 'firstname': 'Jakob', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Gottfried Schatz Research Center for Cell Signaling, Metabolism and Ageing, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Medical University of Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Fangrong', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Gottfried Schatz Research Center for Cell Signaling, Metabolism and Ageing, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Medical University of Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria.\nKey Laboratory of Gastrointestinal Cancer (Fujian Medical University), Ministry of Education, Fuzhou 350001, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Korbelius', 'firstname': 'Melanie', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Gottfried Schatz Research Center for Cell Signaling, Metabolism and Ageing, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Medical University of Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Kuentzel', 'firstname': 'Katharina Barbara', 'initials': 'KB', 'affiliation': 'Gottfried Schatz Research Center for Cell Signaling, Metabolism and Ageing, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Medical University of Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Vujić', 'firstname': 'Nemanja', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Gottfried Schatz Research Center for Cell Signaling, Metabolism and Ageing, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Medical University of Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Akhmetshina', 'firstname': 'Alena', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Gottfried Schatz Research Center for Cell Signaling, Metabolism and Ageing, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Medical University of Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Hörl', 'firstname': 'Gerd', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Otto-Loewi Research Center, Physiological Chemistry, Medical University of Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Paar', 'firstname': 'Margret', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Otto-Loewi Research Center, Physiological Chemistry, Medical University of Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Steyrer', 'firstname': 'Ernst', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Gottfried Schatz Research Center for Cell Signaling, Metabolism and Ageing, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Medical University of Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Kratky', 'firstname': 'Dagmar', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Gottfried Schatz Research Center for Cell Signaling, Metabolism and Ageing, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Medical University of Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria.\nBioTechMed-Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria.'}, {'lastname': 'Madl', 'firstname': 'Tobias', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Gottfried Schatz Research Center for Cell Signaling, Metabolism and Ageing, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Medical University of Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria.\nBioTechMed-Graz, 8010 Graz, Austria.'}]"

Isavuconazole was approved by FDA as a primary therapy for Invasive Aspergillosis (IA) and Mucormycosis. The aim of this study is to look at the real-world use of Isavuconazole in patients with HM and evaluate their clinical outcomes and safety. (2) Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of HM patients at MD Anderson Cancer Center who had definite, probable or possible mold infections between 1 April 2016 and 31 January 2020 and were treated with Isavuconazole for a period of at least 7 days. Clinical and radiological findings were assessed at baseline and at 6 and 12 weeks of follow up. (3) Results: We included 200 HM patients with IFIs that were classified as definite (11), probable (63) and possible (126). Aspergillus spp was the most commonly isolated pathogen. The majority of patients (59%) received prophylaxis with anti-mold therapy and Isavuconazole was used as a primary therapy in 43% of patients, and as salvage therapy in 58%. The switch to Isavuconazole was driven by the failure of the primary therapy in 66% of the cases and by adverse effects in 29%. Isavuconazole was used as monotherapy in 30% of the cases and in combination in 70%. Adverse events possibly related to Isavuconazole were reported in eight patients (4%) leading to drug discontinuation. Moreover, a favorable response with Isavuconazole was observed in 40% at 6 weeks and in 60% at 12 weeks. There was no significant difference between isavuconazole monotherapy and combination therapy (",,,,,10.3390/jof8010074,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Dagher', 'firstname': 'Hiba', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Infectious Diseases, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hachem', 'firstname': 'Ray', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Infectious Diseases, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chaftari', 'firstname': 'Anne-Marie', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Infectious Diseases, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Jiang', 'firstname': 'Ying', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Infectious Diseases, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Ali', 'firstname': 'Shahnoor', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Infectious Diseases, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Deeba', 'firstname': 'Rita', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Department of Infectious Diseases, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Shah', 'firstname': 'Shivan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Infectious Diseases, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Raad', 'firstname': 'Issam', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Infectious Diseases, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.'}]"

Many of these have not been screened in bioassays. The aim of this study was to explore the potential of 5600 Cnidaria natural products (after excluding those known to derive from microbial symbionts), using a systematic approach based on chemical space, drug-likeness, predicted toxicity, and virtual screens. Previous drug-likeness measures: the rule-of-five, quantitative estimate of drug-likeness (QED), and relative drug likelihoods (RDL) are based on a relatively small number of molecular properties. We augmented this approach using reference drug and toxin data sets defined for 51 predicted molecular properties. Cnidaria natural products overlap with drugs and toxins in this chemical space, although a multivariate test suggests that there are some differences between the groups. In terms of the established drug-likeness measures, Cnidaria natural products have generally lower QED and RDL scores than drugs, with a higher prevalence of metabolites that exceed at least one rule-of-five threshold. An index of drug-likeness that includes predicted toxicity (ADMET-score), however, found that Cnidaria natural products were more favourable than drugs. A measure of the distance of individual Cnidaria natural products to the centre of the drug distribution in multivariate chemical space was related to RDL, ADMET-score, and the number of rule-of-five exceptions. This multivariate similarity measure was negatively correlated with the QED score for the same metabolite, suggesting that the different approaches capture different aspects of the drug-likeness of individual metabolites. The contrasting of different drug similarity measures can help summarise the range of drug potential in the Cnidaria natural product data set. The most favourable metabolites were around 210-265 Da, quite often sesquiterpenes, with a moderate degree of complexity. Virtual screening against cancer-relevant targets found wide evidence of affinities, with Glide scores <-7 in 19% of the Cnidaria natural products.",,,,,10.3390/md20010042,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Laguionie-Marchais', 'firstname': 'Claire', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'School of Natural Sciences and Ryan Institute, National University of Ireland Galway, H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Allcock', 'firstname': 'A Louise', 'initials': 'AL', 'affiliation': 'School of Natural Sciences and Ryan Institute, National University of Ireland Galway, H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Baker', 'firstname': 'Bill J', 'initials': 'BJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620-5250, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Conneely', 'firstname': 'Ellie-Ann', 'initials': 'EA', 'affiliation': 'School of Natural Sciences and Ryan Institute, National University of Ireland Galway, H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Dietrick', 'firstname': 'Sarah G', 'initials': 'SG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620-5250, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kearns', 'firstname': 'Fiona', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620-5250, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'McKeever', 'firstname': 'Kate', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'School of Natural Sciences and Ryan Institute, National University of Ireland Galway, H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Young', 'firstname': 'Ryan M', 'initials': 'RM', 'affiliation': 'School of Natural Sciences and Ryan Institute, National University of Ireland Galway, H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland.\nSchool of Chemistry, National University of Ireland Galway, H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Sierra', 'firstname': 'Connor A', 'initials': 'CA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620-5250, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Soldatou', 'firstname': 'Sylvia', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620-5250, USA.\nSchool of Chemistry, National University of Ireland Galway, H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland.'}, {'lastname': 'Woodcock', 'firstname': 'H Lee', 'initials': 'HL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Chemistry, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620-5250, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Johnson', 'firstname': 'Mark P', 'initials': 'MP', 'affiliation': 'School of Natural Sciences and Ryan Institute, National University of Ireland Galway, H91 TK33 Galway, Ireland.'}]"

The aim of this work is to familiarise the reader with x-CSI as a technique and to draw attention to how this technique will need to develop to be of clinical use for the described oncological applications. This article covers the conceptual differences between x-CSI and EI approaches, the advantages of x-CSI, constraints on x-CSI system design, and the achievements of x-CSI in AuNP quantification. The results of the review show there are still approximately two orders of magnitude between the AuNP concentrations used in RDEE applications and the demonstrated detection limits of x-CSI. Two approaches to overcome this were suggested: changing AuNP design or changing x-CSI system design. Optimal system parameters for AuNP detection and general spectral performance as determined by simulation studies were different to those used in the current x-CSI systems, indicating potential gains that may be made with this approach.",,,,,10.3390/jimaging8010004,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Pickford Scienti', 'firstname': 'Oliver L P', 'initials': 'OLP', 'affiliation': 'Joint Department of Physics, Institute of Cancer Research and Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, London SM2 5NG, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Darambara', 'firstname': 'Dimitra G', 'initials': 'DG', 'affiliation': 'Joint Department of Physics, Institute of Cancer Research and Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, London SM2 5NG, UK.'}]"

Due to initiated cases, it is difficult to diagnose and hard to detect the nodule in a lung at the early state. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are effectively applied for early state detection by considering CT-scanned images. Transferring patients from small hospitals to the cancer specialized hospital, Lerdsin Hospital, poses difficulties in information sharing because of the privacy and safety regulations. CD-ROM media was allowed for transferring patients' data to Lerdsin Hospital. Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files cannot be stored on a CD-ROM. DICOM must be converted into other common image formats, such as BMP, JPG and PNG formats. Quality of images can affect the accuracy of the CNN models. In this research, the effect of different image formats is studied and experimented. Three popular medical CNN models, VGG-16, ResNet-50 and MobileNet-V2, are considered and used for osteosarcoma detection. The positive and negative class images are corrected from Lerdsin Hospital, and 80% of all images are used as a training dataset, while the rest are used to validate the trained models. Limited training images are simulated by reducing images in the training dataset. Each model is trained and validated by three different image formats, resulting in 54 testing cases.

Despite recent advances in the treatment of older patients with GBM, survival is still only approximately 9 months compared to approximately 15 months for the general adult population, suggesting that further research is required to optimize management in the older population. The Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) has been shown to have a prognostic and predictive role in the management of older patients with other cancers, and domains of the CGA have demonstrated an association with outcomes in GBM in retrospective studies. Furthermore, the CGA and other geriatric assessment tools are now starting to be prospectively investigated in older GBM populations. This review aims to outline current treatment strategies for older patients with GBM, explore the rationale for inclusion of geriatric assessment in GBM management, and highlight recent data investigating its implementation into practice.",,,,,10.3390/curroncol29010032,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Chahal', 'firstname': 'Manik', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Medical Oncology, British Columbia Cancer-Vancouver Cancer Centre, Vancouver, BC V5Z 4E6, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Thiessen', 'firstname': 'Brian', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Division of Medical Oncology, British Columbia Cancer-Vancouver Cancer Centre, Vancouver, BC V5Z 4E6, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Mariano', 'firstname': 'Caroline', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Division of Medical Oncology, British Columbia Cancer-Vancouver Cancer Centre, Vancouver, BC V5Z 4E6, Canada.'}]"

Although the incidence of NAC-related complications after robotic NSM (RNSM) with immediate breast reconstruction (IBR) is lower than that after conventional NSM, it remains one of the most unwanted complications. We aimed to evaluate body composition-based risk factors for NAC-related complications after RNSM with IBR. Data of 92 patients with breast cancer who underwent RNSM with IBR using direct-to-implant or tissue expander from November 2017 to September 2020 were analyzed retrospectively. Risk factors for NAC-related complications were identified with a focus on body composition using preoperative transverse computed tomography at the third lumbar vertebra level. Postoperative complications were assessed for 6 months. The most common complication was NAC ischemia, occurring in 15 patients (16%). Multivariate analysis revealed a low skeletal muscle index/total adipose tissue index (SMI/TATI) ratio as an independent NAC ischemia risk factor.

Conventional chemotherapy (C) has been considered as an immunosuppressive agent and may thus reduce IRP's risk when used in combination with PD-1/L1 inhibitors. This study aimed to assess the risk of IRP with PD-1/L1 inhibitors plus chemotherapy (I+C) versus PD-1/L1 inhibitors alone (I) in solid cancer treatment.
Multiple databases were searched for RCTs before January 2021. This NMA was performed among I+C, I, and C to investigate IRP's risk. Subgroup analysis was carried out on the basis of different PD-1/L1 inhibitors and cancer types.
Thirty-one RCTs (19,624 patients) were included. The I+C group exhibited a lower risk of IRP in any grade (RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.38-0.95) and in grade 3-5 (RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.21-0.92) as opposed to the I group. The risk of any grade IRP with PD-1 plus chemotherapy was lower than that with PD-1 monotherapy (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28-0.89), although grade 3-5 IRP was similar.

People who are socially disadvantaged often have higher cancer-related mortality and are diagnosed with advanced cancers more often than other people. Such outcomes are linked to the compounding effects of stigma, discrimination, and other barriers, which create persistent inequities in access to care at all points in the cancer trajectory, preventing timely diagnosis and treatment, and further widening the health equity gap. In this commentary, we discuss how growing evidence suggests that people who are considered marginalized are not well-served by the cancer care sector and how the design and structure of services can often impose profound barriers to populations considered socially disadvantaged.

The gold standard for treatment of UES is open uretero-ileal reimplantation (UIR), which is often a challenging and complex procedure associated with significant morbidity. We report a challenging case of long severe bilateral UES (5 cm on the left side, 3 cm on the right side) after RARC in a 55 years old male patient who was previously treated in another institution and who came to our attention with kidney dysfunction and bilateral ureteral stents from the previous two years. Difficult multiple ureteral stent placement and substitutions had been previously performed in another hospital, with resulting urinary leakage. An open surgical procedure via an anterior transperitoneal approach was performed at our hospital, which took 10 h to complete, given the massive intestinal and periureteral adhesions, which required very meticulous dissection. A vascular surgeon was called to repair an accidental rupture that had occurred during the dissection of the external left iliac artery, involved in the extensive periureteral inflammatory process. Excision of a segment of the external iliac artery was accomplished, and an interposition graft using a reversed saphenous vein was performed. Bilateral ureteroneocystostomy followed, which required, on the left side, the interposition of a Casati-Boari flap harvested from the neobladder, and on the right side a neobladder-psoas-hitching procedure with intramucosal direct ureteral reimplantation. The patient recovered well and is currently in good health, as determined at his recent 24-month follow-up visit. No signs of relapse of the strictures or other complications were detected. Bilateral ureteral reimplantation after robotic radical cystectomy is a complex procedure that should be restricted to high-volume centers, where multidisciplinary teams are available, including urologists, endourologists, and general and vascular surgeons.",,,,,10.3390/curroncol29010014,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Mancini', 'firstname': 'Mariangela', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Urological Clinic, University Hospital of Padova, 35121 Padova, Italy.\nDepartment of Surgical, Oncological and Gastroenterological Sciences, University of Padova, 35121 Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Nguyen', 'firstname': 'Alex Anh Ly', 'initials': 'AAL', 'affiliation': 'Urological Clinic, University Hospital of Padova, 35121 Padova, Italy.\nDepartment of Surgical, Oncological and Gastroenterological Sciences, University of Padova, 35121 Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Taverna', 'firstname': 'Alessandra', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Urological Clinic, University Hospital of Padova, 35121 Padova, Italy.\nDepartment of Surgical, Oncological and Gastroenterological Sciences, University of Padova, 35121 Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Beltrami', 'firstname': 'Paolo', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Urological Clinic, University Hospital of Padova, 35121 Padova, Italy.\nDepartment of Surgical, Oncological and Gastroenterological Sciences, University of Padova, 35121 Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Zattoni', 'firstname': 'Filiberto', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Urological Clinic, University Hospital of Padova, 35121 Padova, Italy.\nDepartment of Surgical, Oncological and Gastroenterological Sciences, University of Padova, 35121 Padova, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Dal Moro', 'firstname': 'Fabrizio', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Urological Clinic, University Hospital of Padova, 35121 Padova, Italy.\nDepartment of Surgical, Oncological and Gastroenterological Sciences, University of Padova, 35121 Padova, Italy.'}]"

Recognizing this, there has been some effort to relabel cancer dyads as ""co-survivors"". However, many cancer patients are not comfortable being called a ""survivor"", and the same may apply to their partners. Cancer survivorship, we argue, could be enhanced by helping keep the bond between patients and their partners strong. This includes educating patients and partners about diverse coping strategies that individuals use when facing challenges to their health and wellbeing. We suggest that preemptive couples' counselling in cancer centers may benefit both patients and their partners.",,,,,10.3390/curroncol29010010,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'McGillivray', 'firstname': 'Hannah M K', 'initials': 'HMK', 'affiliation': 'Edinburgh Medical School, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH16 4SB, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Piccolo', 'firstname': 'Elisabetta E L', 'initials': 'EEL', 'affiliation': 'Independent Scholar, Surrey, BC V4A 9T5, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Wassersug', 'firstname': 'Richard J', 'initials': 'RJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Cellular and Physiological Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada.'}]"

Overall survival remains poor, and treatment only effectively occurs at the cost of high toxicity and late adverse effects. It has been reported that the neurokinin-1 receptor/ substance P complex plays an important role in cancer and proved to be a promising target. However, its role in RT has not yet been described. This study aims to determine whether the neurokinin-1 receptor is expressed in RT and whether neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) antagonists can serve as a novel therapeutic approach in treating RTs. By in silico analysis using the cBio Cancer Genomics Portal we found that RTs highly express neurokinin-1 receptor. We confirmed these results by RT-PCR in both tumor cell lines and in human tissue samples of various affected organs. We demonstrated a growth inhibitory and apoptotic effect of aprepitant in viability assays and flow cytometry. Furthermore, this effect proved to remain when used in combination with the cytostatic cisplatin. Western blot analysis showed an upregulation of apoptotic signaling pathways in rhabdoid tumors when treated with aprepitant. Overall, our findings suggest that NK1R may be a promising target for the treatment of RT in combination with other anti-cancer therapies and can be targeted with the NK1R antagonist aprepitant.",,,,,10.3390/curroncol29010008,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Kolorz', 'firstname': 'Julian', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Research Laboratories, Department of Pediatric Surgery, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, 80337 Munich, Germany.""}, {'lastname': 'Demir', 'firstname': 'Salih', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': ""Research Laboratories, Department of Pediatric Surgery, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, 80337 Munich, Germany.""}, {'lastname': 'Gottschlich', 'firstname': 'Adrian', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Center for Integrated Protein Science Munich (CIPSM) and Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine IV, University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, 80337 Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Beirith', 'firstname': 'Iris', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of General, Visceral, and Transplantation Surgery, University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, 81377 Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Ilmer', 'firstname': 'Matthias', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of General, Visceral, and Transplantation Surgery, University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, 81377 Munich, Germany.\nGerman Center for Translational Cancer Research (DKTK), Partner Site Munich, 81377 Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Lüthy', 'firstname': 'Daniel', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Research Laboratories, Department of Pediatric Surgery, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, 80337 Munich, Germany.""}, {'lastname': 'Walz', 'firstname': 'Christoph', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Ludwig Maximilians-University Munich, 80337 Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Dorostkar', 'firstname': 'Mario M', 'initials': 'MM', 'affiliation': 'Center for Neuropathology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, 81377 Munich, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Magg', 'firstname': 'Thomas', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatrics, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, 80337 Munich, Germany.""}, {'lastname': 'Hauck', 'firstname': 'Fabian', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': ""Department of Pediatrics, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, 80337 Munich, Germany.""}, {'lastname': 'von Schweinitz', 'firstname': 'Dietrich', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': ""Research Laboratories, Department of Pediatric Surgery, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, 80337 Munich, Germany.""}, {'lastname': 'Kobold', 'firstname': 'Sebastian', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Center for Integrated Protein Science Munich (CIPSM) and Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Department of Medicine IV, University Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, 80337 Munich, Germany.\nGerman Center for Translational Cancer Research (DKTK), Partner Site Munich, 81377 Munich, Germany.\nEinheit für Klinische Pharmakologie (EKLiP), Helmholtz Zentrum München, German Research Center for Environmental Health (HMGU), 85764 Neuherberg, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Kappler', 'firstname': 'Roland', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': ""Research Laboratories, Department of Pediatric Surgery, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, 80337 Munich, Germany.""}, {'lastname': 'Berger', 'firstname': 'Michael', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': ""Research Laboratories, Department of Pediatric Surgery, Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, 80337 Munich, Germany.""}]"

Compared with traditional chemotherapy, specific targeted therapy has a higher selectivity and fewer adverse reactions, providing a new treatment direction for advanced NSCLC patients. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR-TKIs) are the widely used targeted therapy for NSCLC patients. Their efficacy and prognosis are closely related to the mutation status of the EGFR gene. Clinically, detecting EGFR gene mutation is often limited by difficulty obtaining tissue specimens, limited detecting technology, and economic conditions, so it is of great clinical significance to find indicators to predict EGFR gene mutation status. Clinicopathological characteristics, tumor markers, liquid biopsy, and other predictors are less invasive, economical, and easier to obtain. They can be monitored in real-time, which is supposed to predict EGFR mutation status and provide guidance for the accurate, individualized diagnosis and therapy of NSCLC patients.

Substituent electronic effects on particle stability were investigated using various para-substituted thiophenols. The inductive and resonant effects of functional group modifications were strongly correlated with nanoparticle surface charge and hence their stability. Treatment with thiophenols diminished the negative surface charge of citrate-stabilized gold nanoparticles, but electron-withdrawing substituents limited the magnitude of this diminishment. It is proposed that this phenomenon arises by affecting the interplay of competing sulfur binding modes. This has wide-reaching implications for the design of biosensors using thiol-modified gold surfaces. A proof-of-concept multiplexed SERS biosensor was designed according to these findings using the two thiophenol compounds with the most electron-withdrawing substitutions: NO",,,,,10.3390/bios12010025,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'File', 'firstname': 'Nolan', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Sanguine Diagnostics and Therapeutics Inc., Omaha, NE 68106, USA.\nSchool of Chemistry, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH8 9YL, UK.'}, {'lastname': 'Carmicheal', 'firstname': 'Joseph', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Krasnoslobodtsev', 'firstname': 'Alexey V', 'initials': 'AV', 'affiliation': 'Department of Physics, University of Nebraska at Omaha, Omaha, NE 68182, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Japp', 'firstname': 'Nicole C', 'initials': 'NC', 'affiliation': 'Sanguine Diagnostics and Therapeutics Inc., Omaha, NE 68106, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Souchek', 'firstname': 'Joshua J', 'initials': 'JJ', 'affiliation': 'Sanguine Diagnostics and Therapeutics Inc., Omaha, NE 68106, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Chakravarty', 'firstname': 'Sudesna', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hollingsworth', 'firstname': 'Michael A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Sanguine Diagnostics and Therapeutics Inc., Omaha, NE 68106, USA.\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.\nDepartment of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.\nFred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.\nEppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Sasson', 'firstname': 'Aaron A', 'initials': 'AA', 'affiliation': 'Sanguine Diagnostics and Therapeutics Inc., Omaha, NE 68106, USA.\nDepartment of Surgery, Renaissance School of Medicine, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Natarajan', 'firstname': 'Gopalakrishnan', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kshirsagar', 'firstname': 'Prakash G', 'initials': 'PG', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Jain', 'firstname': 'Maneesh', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.\nFred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hayashi', 'firstname': 'Chihiro', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Junker', 'firstname': 'Wade M', 'initials': 'WM', 'affiliation': 'Sanguine Diagnostics and Therapeutics Inc., Omaha, NE 68106, USA.\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Kaur', 'firstname': 'Sukhwinder', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Batra', 'firstname': 'Surinder K', 'initials': 'SK', 'affiliation': 'Sanguine Diagnostics and Therapeutics Inc., Omaha, NE 68106, USA.\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.\nDepartment of Pathology and Microbiology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.\nFred and Pamela Buffett Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.'}]"

Solutions with adhesive separating foil and an Ag/Au chip were compared with the previously used two-paint separating polymer and pure gold chip. These solutions were tested using the example of a biosensor for cathepsin D (Cath D), which consisted of pepstatin A (a Cath D inhibitor) immobilized via a cysteamine linker using the NHS/EDC protocol. Four material versions of the Cath D biosensor proved adequate in terms of range of linearity, LOQ, precision and recovery. All four versions of the biosensor were used for the determination of Cath D in the blood serum patients with glioblastoma and control samples, producing very similar results and showing an elevated biomarker concentration in the case of cancer.

A Preliminary Study.,"['anxiety', 'breast cancer', 'depression', 'hopelessness', 'stress', 'surgery']","Behavioral sciences (Basel, Switzerland)","This study aimed to investigate psychiatric symptomatology in a sample of patients affected by breast cancer undergoing surgery, evaluating the potential mediators on perceived stress levels, depression and hopelessness. The study was conducted on eighty-five patients with breast cancer, admitted consecutively to the Breast Unit of the IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, between May 2018 and December 2019. Sociodemographic (age of diagnosis, gender, marital and occupational status, educational level, having children) and clinical (type and side of surgery, previous breast surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy and axillary dissection) characteristics were investigated through a semi-structured interview. The following rating scales were administered: Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Hopelessness Scale, and Perceived Stress Scale. Our findings indicate that the presence of children and of a partner was associated with a lower total score on the clinical dimensions evaluated. Furthermore, we found demolitive surgery to be a mediator between perceived stress and hopelessness, while history of previous breast surgery was found to be a mediator between demolitive surgery and perceived stress. In conclusion, patients affected by breast cancer undergoing more complex and demolitive surgery or with history of previous breast surgery should be mostly monitored from a psychological and psychiatric point of view from the beginning of treatments to evaluate the first manifestations of psychiatric symptomatology.",,,,,10.3390/bs12010009,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Baldelli', 'firstname': 'Ilaria', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgical Sciences and Integrated Diagnostics (DISC), University of Genoa, 16132 Genoa, Italy.\nIRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132 Genoa, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Gari', 'firstname': 'Matteo', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132 Genoa, Italy.\nDepartment of Neuroscience, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Genetics, Maternal and Child Health (DINOGMI), Section of Psychiatry, University of Genoa, 16132 Genoa, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Aguglia', 'firstname': 'Andrea', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132 Genoa, Italy.\nDepartment of Neuroscience, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Genetics, Maternal and Child Health (DINOGMI), Section of Psychiatry, University of Genoa, 16132 Genoa, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Amerio', 'firstname': 'Andrea', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132 Genoa, Italy.\nDepartment of Neuroscience, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Genetics, Maternal and Child Health (DINOGMI), Section of Psychiatry, University of Genoa, 16132 Genoa, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Berrino', 'firstname': 'Valeria', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgical Sciences and Integrated Diagnostics (DISC), University of Genoa, 16132 Genoa, Italy.\nIRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132 Genoa, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Santori', 'firstname': 'Gregorio', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgical Sciences and Integrated Diagnostics (DISC), University of Genoa, 16132 Genoa, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Friedman', 'firstname': 'Daniele', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgical Sciences and Integrated Diagnostics (DISC), University of Genoa, 16132 Genoa, Italy.\nIRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132 Genoa, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Serafini', 'firstname': 'Gianluca', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132 Genoa, Italy.\nDepartment of Neuroscience, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Genetics, Maternal and Child Health (DINOGMI), Section of Psychiatry, University of Genoa, 16132 Genoa, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Amore', 'firstname': 'Mario', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'IRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132 Genoa, Italy.\nDepartment of Neuroscience, Rehabilitation, Ophthalmology, Genetics, Maternal and Child Health (DINOGMI), Section of Psychiatry, University of Genoa, 16132 Genoa, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Raposio', 'firstname': 'Edoardo', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgical Sciences and Integrated Diagnostics (DISC), University of Genoa, 16132 Genoa, Italy.\nIRCCS Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, 16132 Genoa, Italy.'}]"

There is an urgent need to develop novel breast cancer therapies to overcome the shortcomings of conventional surgery and chemotherapy, which include poor drug efficiency, damage to normal tissues, and increased side effects. Drug delivery systems based on injectable hydrogels have recently gained remarkable attention, as they offer encouraging solutions for localized, targeted, and controlled drug release to the tumor site. Such systems have great potential for improving drug efficiency and reducing the side effects caused by long-term exposure to chemotherapy. The present review aims to provide a critical analysis of the latest developments in the application of drug delivery systems using stimuli-responsive injectable hydrogels for breast cancer treatment. The focus is on discussing how such hydrogel systems enhance treatment efficacy and incorporate multiple breast cancer therapies into one system, in response to multiple stimuli, including temperature, pH, photo-, magnetic field, and glutathione.

Given the clinical importance of emergent viral variants with increased transmission, there is an urgent need to understand the early stages of viral replication and transcription. We used single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridisation (smFISH) to quantify positive sense RNA genomes with 95% detection efficiency, while simultaneously visualising negative sense genomes, subgenomic RNAs, and viral proteins. Our absolute quantification of viral RNAs and replication factories revealed that SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA is long-lived after entry, suggesting that it avoids degradation by cellular nucleases. Moreover, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 replication is highly variable between cells, with only a small cell population displaying high burden of viral RNA. Unexpectedly, the B.1.1.7 variant, first identified in the UK, exhibits significantly slower replication kinetics than the Victoria strain, suggesting a novel mechanism contributing to its higher transmissibility with important clinical implications.",,,,"© 2022, Lee et al.",10.7554/eLife.74153,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Jeffrey Y', 'initials': 'JY', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, The University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Wing', 'firstname': 'Peter Ac', 'initials': 'PA', 'affiliation': 'Nuffield Department of Medicine, The University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) Oxford Institute (COI), The University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Gala', 'firstname': 'Dalia S', 'initials': 'DS', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, The University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Noerenberg', 'firstname': 'Marko', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, The University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.\nMRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, The University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Järvelin', 'firstname': 'Aino I', 'initials': 'AI', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, The University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Titlow', 'firstname': 'Joshua', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, The University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhuang', 'firstname': 'Xiaodong', 'initials': 'X', 'affiliation': 'Nuffield Department of Medicine, The University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Palmalux', 'firstname': 'Natasha', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, The University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Iselin', 'firstname': 'Louisa', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, The University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Thompson', 'firstname': 'Mary Kay', 'initials': 'MK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, The University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Parton', 'firstname': 'Richard M', 'initials': 'RM', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, The University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Prange-Barczynska', 'firstname': 'Maria', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Nuffield Department of Medicine, The University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.\nLudwig Institute for Cancer Research, The University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Wainman', 'firstname': 'Alan', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, The University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Salguero', 'firstname': 'Francisco J', 'initials': 'FJ', 'affiliation': 'UK Health Security Agency, UKHSA-Porton Down, Salisbury, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Bishop', 'firstname': 'Tammie', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Nuffield Department of Medicine, The University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.\nLudwig Institute for Cancer Research, The University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Agranoff', 'firstname': 'Daniel', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Infectious Diseases, University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust, Brighton, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'James', 'firstname': 'William', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, The University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.\nJames & Lillian Martin Centre, Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, The University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Castello', 'firstname': 'Alfredo', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, The University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.\nMRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, The University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'McKeating', 'firstname': 'Jane A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'Nuffield Department of Medicine, The University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.\nChinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS) Oxford Institute (COI), The University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Davis', 'firstname': 'Ilan', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry, The University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.'}]"

35049438,Alpha-solanine anti-tumor effects in non-small cell lung cancer through regulating the energy metabolism pathway.,"['Alpha-solanine', 'Energy Metabolism pathway', 'Metabolomics', 'NSCLC', 'Network Pharmacology']",Recent patents on anti-cancer drug discovery,"Lung cancer is a malignant tumor with a high incidence in China, especially non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is the main threat to human life, with terrible morbidity and mortality. The research on the treatment and mechanism of NSCLC has been the forefront and hotspot of research. Recent patents shows that alpha-solanine (α-solanine) exhibits the best anti-cancer activity, although its target and related mechanism remain to be elucidated.
This study aims to explore the possible targets and mechanisms of α-solanine in the treatment of NSCLC through network pharmacology and experimental verification.
Network pharmacology was applied to screen the possible targets of α-solanine on NSCLC, construct core networks, and perform GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis, to predict the mechanism of α-solanine against NSCLC. Experiments were implemented to verify the results of network pharmacology in vitro. The A549 and PC-9 cells were exposed to α-solanine to assess the antitumor effect. Cell apoptosis was determined by the Annexin-V/PI assay. Targeted energy metabolomics was used to further validate the results in network pharmacology and energy metabolism pathway-related proteins were detected by immunofluorescence and western blot.
Network pharmacology showed that there were 130 potential targets of α-solanine and NSCLC. GO and KEGG analysis showed that the energy metabolism pathway is the main pathway for α-solanine to exert anti-tumor effects on NSCLC. Experimental results showed that α-solanine inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and promoted cell apoptosis. At the same time, after α-solanine treatment, the expression of the energy metabolism pathway-related proteins including GPI, ALDOA, TPI1, PKLR, LDHA and ALDH3 was reduced. In addition, α-solanine also affects the amino acid metabolism of A549 and PC-9 cells.
Based on a combination of network pharmacological prediction and experimental verification, α-solanine may exert anti-NSCLC effects by regulating the energy metabolism pathway.","Based on a combination of network pharmacological prediction and experimental verification, α-solanine may exert anti-NSCLC effects by regulating the energy metabolism pathway.",,"Network pharmacology showed that there were 130 potential targets of α-solanine and NSCLC.

The anticancer efficacy of the ethanolic extract from pericarps of Garcinia mangostana was investigated in human prostate cancer cells (PC3), melanoma cells (B16F10), breast cancer cells (MCF7) and glioblastoma (U87) cell lines.
3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to measure cell viability. propidium iodide (PI) staining and analysis on a flow cytometer was used to identify apoptosis. Action on cell migration was evaluated by scratch assay and gelatin zymography. Furthermore, the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was measured. Moreover, we investigated the synergistic efficacy with several combinations of Garcinia mangostana extract (GME) with doxorubicin.
GME reduced cell viability in malignant cell dose and time-dependently. GME-induced sub-G1 peak in flow cytometry histogram of treated cells control representing apoptotic cell death is involved in GME toxicity. Furthermore, GME exhibited inhibitory effects on the migration ability of U87 cells, which was accompanied by inhibition in the activity and expression of MMP2 (matrix metalloproteinase-2). Besides, GSH level and SOD activity was significantly reduced while there was an increase in ROS and MDA concentration following 24 hr GME treatment. Moreover, combination of GME (1.5-25μg/mL) with Dox (6 µg/mL) displayed synergistic efficacy and cell growth inhibition.
In conclusion, GME could cause cell death in PC3, MCF7, U87, and B16F10 cell lines, in which apoptosis plays an imperative role. Plant extract decreased the migration ability of the cells by inhibiting the activity and expression of Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).

Various conventional techniques like surgery, radiation and chemotherapy are employed but possess limitations such as organ toxicity, infection, nausea, vomiting, etc. Also, several nanotechnology-based synthetic vehicle delivery systems like liposomes, nanoparticles, etc. are used but they lack targeting efficiency that results in poor propulsion and control. Therefore, there is a need for naturally-driven drug carriers to overcome such limitations. Sperm-based drug delivery is the new area for targeted delivery that offers self-propulsion to tumor sites, higher biocompatibility, longer lifespan and increased tissue penetration with enhanced localization. Drug-loaded sperm cells are harnessed with micro/nanomotor that will guide them to the intended target site.

After obtaining approval from the Ethics Review Committee (2020-261), 683 adult patients who underwent open radical surgery for uterine, cervical, or pancreatic cancer under general anesthesia using inhalational anesthetics at Kyushu University hospital between December 2012 and March 2020 were included in this retrospective study. The odds ratio (OR) for the occurrence of POS between the two groups (sevoflurane and desflurane) was calculated. Multivariable-adjusted analysis was performed using possible factors affecting POS. Furthermore, propensity score (PS) matching was conducted using these factors. The multivariable-adjusted OR for the occurrence of shivering in the desflurane group (62 occurrences/356 patients) was 1.06 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-1.62, ",,,,,10.1089/ther.2021.0029,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Shirozu', 'firstname': 'Kazuhiro', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, Kyushu University Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Nobukuni', 'firstname': 'Keiko', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Operating Rooms, Kyushu University Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Umehara', 'firstname': 'Kaoru', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Operating Rooms, Kyushu University Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Nagamatsu', 'firstname': 'Masako', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, Kyushu University Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Higashi', 'firstname': 'Midoriko', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.'}, {'lastname': 'Yamaura', 'firstname': 'Ken', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.'}]"

Part B, Reviews","Regenerative medicine based on stem cell research has the potential to provide advanced health care for human beings. Recent studies demonstrate that stem cells in human urine can serve as an excellent source of graft cells for regenerative therapy, mainly due to simple, low-cost, and noninvasive cell isolation. These cells, termed human urine-derived stem cells (USCs), are highly expandable and can differentiate into various cell lineages. They share many biological properties with mesenchymal stem cells, such as potent paracrine effects and immunomodulation ability. The advantage of USCs has motivated researchers to explore their applications in regenerative medicine, including genitourinary regeneration, musculoskeletal repair, skin wound healing, and disease treatment. Although USCs have showed many positive outcomes in preclinical studies, and although the possible applications of USCs for animal therapy have been reported, many issues need to be addressed before clinical translation. This article provides a comprehensive review of USC biology and recent advances in their application for tissue regeneration. Challenges in the clinical translation of USC-based therapy are also discussed. Impact statement Recently, stem cells isolated from urine, referred to as urine-derived stem cells (USCs), have gained much interest in the field of regenerative medicine. Many advantages of human USCs have been found for cell-based therapy: (i) the cell isolation procedure is simple and low cost; (ii) they have remarkable proliferation ability, multidifferentiation potential, and paracrine effects; and (iii) they facilitate tissue regeneration in many animal models. With the hope to facilitate the development of USC-based therapy, we describe the current understanding of USC biology, summarize recent advances in their applications, and discuss future challenges in clinical translation.",,,,,10.1089/ten.teb.2021.0142,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Yi-Zhou', 'initials': 'YZ', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering, Orthopedic Research Institute, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'He', 'firstname': 'Tao', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering, Orthopedic Research Institute, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu, China.\nDepartment of Breast Surgery, West China School of Medicine/West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Cui', 'firstname': 'Jing', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering, Orthopedic Research Institute, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Jiang', 'firstname': 'Yan-Lin', 'initials': 'YL', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering, Orthopedic Research Institute, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zeng', 'firstname': 'Jun-Feng', 'initials': 'JF', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering, Orthopedic Research Institute, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Wen-Qian', 'initials': 'WQ', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering, Orthopedic Research Institute, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Xie', 'firstname': 'Hui-Qi', 'initials': 'HQ', 'affiliation': 'Laboratory of Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering, Orthopedic Research Institute, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy and Cancer Center, West China Hospital, Sichuan University and Collaborative Innovation Center of Biotherapy, Chengdu, China.'}]"

35049245,Leukocytes infiltration correlates intratumoral microvessel density and influence overall and late-phase disease-free survival in hepatocellular carcinoma.,[],Medicine,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a severe type of primary liver cancer with high postoperative recurrence. The prognosis predictability of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (TILs) for patients who underwent HCC resection has been widely reported. However, limited information is available about TIL trafficking, which is also crucial for HCC patients.We included tumor tissue samples and clinical data from 89 HCC patients in this study and performed immunohistochemistry for CD3, CD8, FoxP3, and CD31. TILs were measured using an algorithm for quantification of tumor immune stroma (QTiS). Intratumoral microvessels were counted using Weidner's method. We first examined correlations among them and analyzed their relationships with clinical and survival data.Intratumoral microvessel density (iMVD) was significantly correlated with infiltration of CD3+ (r = 0.338, P = .001) and CD8+ (r = 0.320, P = .002) cells, but not FoxP3+ (r = 0.153, P = .152) cells. After multivariate analysis, higher infiltration of CD3+ (P = .038) independently showed significant predictability on better overall survival after resection of HCC. Although no influence of CD3+ (P = .386) and CD8+ (P = .648) cells were found on general disease-free survival, infiltration of CD3+ (P = .012), tumor size (P = .032) and albumin (P = .007) cells independently predicted late-phase disease-free survival. No significant relationships regarding iMVD, and infiltration of FoxP3+ cells with overall and disease-free survival were found.Our data suggest that increased iMVD could enrich tumor-infiltrating CD3+ cells. Infiltrated CD3+ cells could help to better predict both the overall and late-phase disease-free survival after resection of HCC.",,,,"Copyright © 2021 the Author(s).

35049242,Increased risk of bladder cancer in young adult men with hyperlipidemia: A population-based cohort study.,[],Medicine,"A high-cholesterol diet increases the risk of bladder cancer. The purpose of this nationwide longitudinal population-based retrospective cohort study is to investigate whether hyperlipidemia is a risk factor for bladder cancer.Data from Taiwan National Health Insurance Database were analyzed. The primary study end point was the occurrence of newly diagnosed bladder cancer. The relative risk of bladder cancer in a hyperlipidemia cohort was compared with that in an age- and gender-matched non-hyperlipidemia cohort by using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Cox regression analyses were further adjusted by the propensity score.Our data revealed that the hyperlipidemia cohort (n = 33,555) had a significantly higher subsequent risk of bladder cancer than did the non-hyperlipidemia cohort (n = 33,555) (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.37, P = .005) after propensity score adjustment. Subgroup analyses revealed that men in the hyperlipidemia cohort had a significantly higher subsequent risk of bladder cancer than did those in the non-hyperlipidemia cohort (adjusted HR = 1.36, P = .040). However, the risk of bladder cancer was not significantly different between women in the hyperlipidemia cohort and those in the non-hyperlipidemia cohort. Subgroup analyses further revealed that the risk of bladder cancer was significantly higher in men aged 20 to 39 years in the hyperlipidemia cohort than in those in the non-hyperlipidemia cohort (adjusted HR = 5.45, P = .029).In conclusion, hyperlipidemia is a risk factor for bladder cancer in young adult men.",,,,"Copyright © 2021 the Author(s).

35049231,Successful treatment using immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy for metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary origin with bulky abdominal mass: A case report.,[],Medicine,"Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) means that the primary focus cannot be found after preliminary clinical evaluation. It accounts for 2.3% to 5% of newly diagnosed cancer cases. Due to the lack of standard treatment, CUP is usually associated with poor prognosis and is the third to fourth most common cause of cancer-related deaths.
We report the case of a 42-year-old female patient who was admitted to the hospital for intermittent right abdominal pain and abdominal distension. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a large abdominal mass of unknown origin, which was difficult to resect due to its close relationship with surrounding tissues. Twenty days later, the patient had enlarged left supraclavicular lymph nodes, and percutaneous biopsy revealed squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tissue and blood samples showed immune-related mutations and PD-L1 expression.
The patient was diagnosed with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary origin, with a bulky abdominal mass.
The patient was treated with carboplatin, albumin-binding paclitaxel, and immune checkpoint inhibitor (carilizumab). After 6 cycles, the patient was switched to maintenance treatment with carilizumab.
The general condition of the patient improved, and the lesion was significantly reduced. The treatment efficacy was assessed as partial remission according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. The patient benefited from immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy.
There is no recommended standard treatment for most CUPs, which leads to their poor prognoses. By performing NGS for patients and targeting immune-related positive predictors, immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy may prolong the overall survival of patients. This case report suggests that immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy is feasible and effective in patients with CUP.",,,,"Copyright © 2021 the Author(s).

The radiological features of brain metastases (BMs) have rarely been reported. Hemorrhage is frequently noted in BMs from thyroid cancer. This study aimed to investigate the clinico-radiological features of BMs from thyroid cancer and to determine the risk factors to predict BM hemorrhage.We retrospectively evaluated the MR images of 35 patients with BMs from thyroid cancer at our hospital from 2013 to 2020. The number, size, site, presence of extra-cranial metastasis, presence of perilesional edema, intra-tumoral hemorrhage, enhancement pattern, and presence of diffusion restriction on MRI were described. We further classified the thyroid cancers into hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic groups to investigate the factors associated with hemorrhage.54.29% of patients with thyroid BMs (19/35) had neurologic symptoms. 94.29% of patients (33/35) had extra-cranial metastases. The most common histology of primary thyroid cancer was papillary thyroid cancer (71.43%, 25/35), followed by anaplastic thyroid cancer (22.86%, 8/35). Thyroid cancer BMs were located mostly in the supra-tentorium (51.43%, 18/35) or both the supra and infra-tentorium (45.71%, 16/35). 60% of patients (21/35) showed hemorrhage within the BMs. The strongest predictor for BM hemorrhage was tumor size (variable importance: 50).Thyroid cancer BMs exhibit a bleeding tendency.

35049227,A novel risk signature with 6 RNA binding proteins for prognosis prediction in patients with glioblastoma.,[],Medicine,"Recent studies suggested that RNA binding proteins (RBPs) were related to the tumorigenesis and progression of glioma. This study was conducted to identify prognostic RBPs of glioblastoma (GBM) and construct an RBP signature to predict the prognosis of GBM.Univariate Cox regression analysis was carried out to identify the RBPs associated with overall survival of GBM in the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), GSE16011, and Repository for Molecular Brain Neoplasia data (Rembrandt) datasets, respectively. Overlapping RBPs from the TCGA, GSE16011, and Rembrandt datasets were selected. The biological role of prognostic RBPs was assessed by Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and protein-protein interaction analyses. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to construct an RBP-related risk signature. The prognostic value of RBP signature was measured by Kaplan-Meier method and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve. A nomogram based on independent prognostic factors was established to predict survival for GBM. The CGGA cohort was used as the validation cohort for external validation.This study identified 27 RBPs associated with the prognosis of GBM and constructed a 6-RPBs signature. Kaplan-Meier curves suggested that high-risk score was associated with a poor prognosis. Area under the curve of 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival was 0.618, 0.728, and 0.833 for TCGA cohort, 0.655, 0.909, and 0.911 for GSE16011 cohort, and 0.665, 0.792, and 0.781 for Rembrandt cohort, respectively. A nomogram with 4 parameters (age, chemotherapy, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter status, and risk score) was constructed. The calibration curve showed that the nomogram prediction was in good agreement with the actual observation.The 6-RBPs signature could effectively predict the prognosis of GBM, and our findings supplemented the prognostic index of GBM to a certain extent.",,,,"Copyright © 2021 the Author(s).

35049225,GPR116 overexpression correlates with poor prognosis in gastric cancer.,[],Medicine,"The G protein-coupled receptor 116 (GPR116) is an adhesion subtype of the G protein-coupled receptor family and has been reported to be involved in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Moreover, it has been shown to predict poor prognosis in breast and colorectal cancers. However, little is known about the role of GPR116 in gastric cancer (GC). In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression and clinical prognostic significance of GPR116 in GC.The mRNA expression levels of GPR116 in GC were analyzed using Gene Expression Omnibus and UALCAN databases, and GPR116 protein expression in GC tissues was detected using immunohistochemistry. The relationship between GPR116 expression and prognosis in patients with GC was analyzed and further validated using the Kaplan-Meier Plotter database. The correlation between GPR116 and the differentially expressed genes identified was analyzed using the LinkedOmics database. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using WebGestalt. The results revealed that GPR116 expression was significantly upregulated in GC tissues, which was positively correlated with tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging and tumor invasion. Prognostic analysis suggested that high GPR116 expression contributed to poor overall survival in GC patients. Multivariate Cox analysis indicated that GPR116 overexpression was an independent prognostic indicator in patients with GC (HR = 1.855, 95% CI 1.021-3.370, P = .043). Enrichment analysis showed that GPR116 co-expression genes were mainly involved in extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, cell adhesion, PI3K-Akt signaling, DNA replication, and cell cycle pathways. In conclusion, GPR116 was highly expressed in GC tissues and associated with poor prognosis in patients with GC, Thus GPR116 may be a novel prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target for GC treatment.",,,,"Copyright © 2021 the Author(s).

35049220,The clinical effects of ultrasound-guided microwave ablation in the treatment of primary hepatic carcinoma: Protocol for a retrospective clinical observation.,[],Medicine,"Despite the continuous advancement of liver cancer diagnosis technology and level, there are still nearly two-thirds of patients with primary liver cancer that are already advanced at the time of diagnosis. Ultrasound-guided microwave ablation, as a palliative treatment for intermediate and advanced liver cancer, is currently recognized internationally Standard treatment for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. However, recently, some scholars hold that ultrasound-guided microwave ablation does not guarantee complete inactivation of tumor lesions.
This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ultrasound-guided microwave ablation in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma through retrospective analysis. This study will follow a clinical research method with consecutive enrollment. The overall survival rate, objective tumor remission rate, serum indices and incidence of adverse effects after treatment will be counted for patients.
At present, there are no good treatment options for intermediate and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, there is a strong demand to explore the individualized multidisciplinary combined treatment model based on ultrasound-guided microwave ablation.

BDH1 is a key enzyme that regulates the metabolism and synthesis of ketone bodies. This study sought to explore the prognostic relevance of BDH1 mRNA expression in liver cancer.We utilized the Cancer Genome Atlas datasets to analyze the relationship between BDH1 expression and clinical outcomes. We used Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox analyses to explore the relevance of BDH1 mRNA levels to patient prognosis. Further gene set enrichment analysis was conducted as a means of comparing differences in gene expression as a function of BDH1 expression.Liver cancer samples exhibited significantly decreased BDH1 mRNA expression, and that this downregulation was correlated with a number of clinicopathological variables including gender, histologic grade, stage, TNM classification, and both overall and relapse-free survival. We further determined that BDH1 mRNA expression was an independent predictor of liver cancer patient prognosis. A subsequent gene set enrichment analysis found genes affected by BDH1 expression to be those enriched in pathways relating to MYC and wnt/β-catenin signaling.Our preliminary findings demonstrate for the first time that low expression of BDH1 mRNA is a potentially valuable independent prognostic indicator for liver cancer detection.",,,,"Copyright © 2021 the Author(s).

35049209,A new spray-type adhesion barrier (AdSpray) improves condition for surgical treatment in the reversal of Hartmann procedure: A case report.,[],Medicine,"Hartmann procedure (HP) often causes severe postoperative adhesions in the pelvic space; therefore, the reversal of Hartmann procedure (RHP) is a challenging surgery. A new spray-type antiadhesion agent, AdSpray, has been reported to be useful in three-dimensional fields such as the liver. However, there are no reports of its use in HP. We present a case of a male patient with rectal cancer who underwent laparoscopic HP with AdSpray to prevent postoperative adhesions.
A 52-year-old man presented with melena and constipation.
Colonoscopy revealed an almost obstructive type II tumor at the rectosigmoid colon, and histopathological examination revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Enhanced abdominal computed tomography revealed slightly enlarged regional lymph nodes but no ascites around the tumor, and there was no metastasis to the liver or lungs. Therefore, we diagnosed clinical stage T4aN1bM0 rectosigmoid colon cancer. Intraoperatively, a metastatic tumor of the liver surface and a high degree of valve retention in the oral colon were identified.
After performing laparoscopic HP with AdSpray, we scheduled a laparoscopic RHP with staged hepatic surgery for synchronous liver metastasis from colorectal cancer 1 month later.
No postoperative inflammatory adhesions were observed in the pelvis or around the rectal stump, allowing us to perform RHP by a single-incision laparoscopic surgery from the stoma site without any problem. The operation time for RHP was 80 minutes; the patient was in good general condition after the operation, and he was discharged on postoperative day 7.
In laparoscopic HP, Adspray was easy to use for three-dimensional fields such as the pelvis and effectively prevented postoperative inflammatory adhesions.

The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacies of different methods on fertility preservation in patients with early-stage EC.
We searched the major online databases (PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) to collect the research literature on fertility preservation therapy in patients with early-stage well-differentiated EC aged ≤ 40 years from January 1999 to October 2019. The inclusion was performed using the R software (version R3.5.3) meta-analysis of a single rate. The efficacy of the following three fertility preservation treatments was evaluated from four aspects, the complete remission rate (CRR), recurrence rate (ReR), pregnancy rate (PregR), and live birth rate (LBR): a) taking oral progestin only therapy, b) hysteroscopic resection combined with progestin/levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS)/GnRH-a, c) LNG-IUS or combined with progestin/GnRH-a.

35049196,Community intervention study of viscera massage in overweight/obese type 2 diabetes high-risk population.,[],Medicine,"Prediabetes is an intermediate metabolic state between normoglycemia and diabetes. Without intervention, prediabetes often progresses to diabetes and prediabetes is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, renal disease, and dementia. Lifestyle modification play a major role in controlling prediabetes. But lifestyle interventions are often with poor compliance and side effects of drugs are often be dislike by people. As a non-invasive therapy with no side effects, abdominal massage (AM), also called viscera massage in China, has been used to treat prediabetes and obesity-associated diseases. The gut microbiota has been recognized as an important factor in the development of metabolic diseases. Individuals with prediabetes have aberrant intestinal microbiota character. Colonic transport time and stool consistency are strongly associated with gut microbiota. Viscera massage can ease constipation by reducing colonic transport time and promoting intestinal motility. We can infer that viscera massage can modulate composition of gut microbiota affects human metabolism. So, in this trial, we will explore the mechanism of viscera massage on prediabetes from the perspective of intestinal microbiota.
Eighty prediabetes individuals will be recruited for this study. Eighty prediabetes individuals will be divided into lifestyle intervention group and viscera massage + lifestyle intervention group by a simple random method. Each group will have 40 individuals. The manipulation of the viscera massage + lifestyle intervention group will be mainly carried out through rubbing the abdomen, kneading abdomen, vibrating abdomen, and pressing the abdomen, 30 minutes per time, once a day, with 2 days off every 5 days. Lifestyle interventions will be performed by combining pushing healthy lifestyle guidance information through Wechat application and giving face-to-face advice together daily. The lifestyle intervention group will receive healthy lifestyle intervention only. All the intervention will be conducted for 4 weeks. Weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-height ratio will be measured at the last day of every week. Triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting blood-glucose, 2-hour post-meal blood glucose (2hPG) and glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting insulin and insulin resistance index will be tested at the first day and last day of the intervention course. The fecal samples of subjects will be gathered at the first day and last day of the intervention course and will be performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic detection.

A 69-year-old male patient was referred to our department for further investigation of elevated hepatobiliary enzymes. He presented with no symptoms besides intermittent fever of 38°C. He had an operative history of CABG using the RGEA.
Abdominal CT and esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed an ampullary tumor and biopsy specimen from the lesion revealed adenocarcinoma. CT angiography revealed the rGDA instead of a normal common HA.
We performed a safe PD, preserving the rGDA and the RGEA to maintain hepatic and cardiac perfusion.
Owing to the presence of a refractory pancreatic fistula, the length-of-hospital stay was extended, and he was discharged on postoperative day 72 without vascular complications. At present, the patient is in good physical condition and does not present with cardiovascular complications as well as tumor recurrence at 6 months after surgery.
This is possibly the first case of a patient who underwent PD and has a proper HA following a GDA arising from a superior mesenteric artery (rGDA) and has a previous operative history of CABG using the gastroepiploic artery. The coexistence of the history of cardiovascular surgery made PD for this patient considerably more challenging.In the case of a rare anatomical anomaly, a coronary artery bypass via the RGEA should not be considered as an obstacle when R0 resection is achievable.",,,,"Copyright © 2021 the Author(s).

35049170,"The association between polymorphism of the long noncoding RNA, Plasmacytoma variant translocation 1, and the risk of gastric cancer.",[],Medicine,"Genetic polymorphisms of plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 can affect various tumors including gastro-intestinal, sexual hormone sensitive cancers and lymphoma. Accumulated evidence have shown that plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 acts as an oncogene and tumor suppressor in various cancers. In fact, the rs13255292 and rs2608053 single nucleotide polymorphisms of plasmacytoma variant translocation 1are known to affect lymphoma; however, their effects on gastric cancer are primarily unknown. In this study, we evaluated the association between these plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 polymorphisms and the risk of gastric cancer.In the present study, 462 patients diagnosed with gastric cancer and 377 cancer-free controls were enrolled. The TaqMan genotyping assay was used to analyze the association between rs13255292 and rs2608053 single nucleotide polymorphisms and the risk of gastric cancer.The rs2608053 dominant model (CT + TT) was associated with a decreased risk of gastric cancer in T3 + T4 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.61, confidence interval (CI) = 0.41 - 0.92, P = .019), and stage III Gastric cancer subgroups (OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.38 - 0.91, P = .017) compared to the CC genotype. When stratified analysis by sex was carried out, the rs13255292 dominant model (CT + TT) had a significant association with an increased risk of gastric cancer in the female negative lymph node metastasis gastric cancer subgroup, compared to the CC genotype (OR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.16 - 3.30, P = .012). The recessive model (TT) of rs13255292 was associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer in the male T3 + T4 gastric cancer subgroups compared to the CC + CT genotype (OR = 3.82, 95% CI = 1.02 - 14.33, P = .047). The dominant model (CT + TT) of rs2608053 was related to a decreased risk of gastric cancer in male T3 + T4 (OR = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.33 - 0.98, P = .042) and stage III gastric cancer subgroups (OR = 0.49, 95% CI = 0.27 - 0.89, P = .020) compared to the CC genotype.The rs13255292 and rs2608053 single nucleotide polymorphisms in plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 may contribute to susceptibility of gastric cancer.

35049156,[Campaign of labour inspections on the implementation of protection measures against carcinogenic agents in fuel station workers].,"['benzene', 'biological monitoring', 'environmental monitoring', 'fuel station workers', 'labour inspections']",Giornale italiano di medicina del lavoro ed ergonomia,"Following the reduction in levels of exposure to benzene over the last few decades, the cancer risk of refuelers currently represents an occupational hygiene issue potentially underestimated by employers and workers themselves. Based on the literature data, the occurrence of adverse effects of neoplastic nature can not actually be excluded in this professional category, since it is not possible to define a threshold dose. In the period 2016 - 2019, an extensive focused campaign of labour inspections was conducted in the province of Bari by the OSH inspection services of the Health Local Authority in order to verify the compliance with the legislation on the workers' protection from carcinogenic agents at fuel stations. In particular, the obligations referring risk assessment, workplace hygiene, environmental monitoring, personal protective equipment (PPE), health surveillance, biological monitoring and recording of exposure to carcinogens were verified. Although these obligations were documentarily fulfilled by almost all the 162 plants inspected in the province of Bari, several critical issues were found in the approach to carcinogenic risk, including, more frequently, the lack of suitable changing rooms with relative lockers for clothing, the scarce use of gloves when dispensing fuel, the absence or incompleteness of the carcinogenic risk assessment documents, the failed or incorrect execution of biological monitoring. Data of the environmental monitoring carried out by the companies confirm that the current exposures to benzene of fuel distributors are considerably below the limit values set by the Italian legislation. The most frequently used biological exposure indicator was trans, trans-muconic urinary acid (TTMA-U). In order to reduce as much as possible the health risks for refuelers, it is needed that employers, workers and occupational physicians pay more attention to their respective duties, ensuring corrective or ameliorative interventions focused on assessment of the risk of carcinogens, supply and use of PPE, design of workplaces, health surveillance and biological monitoring of workers. The poor value of the end-of-shift TTMA-U as a biological indicator of exposure to low-dose benzene is also confirmed.
A seguito della riduzione dei livelli di esposizione a benzene nel corso degli ultimi decenni, il rischio cancerogeno degli addetti al rifornimento di carburante rappresenta oggi un problema di igiene del lavoro potenzialmente sottovalutato dai datori di lavoro e dagli stessi lavoratori. I dati di letteratura non consentono peraltro di escludere la possibilità di effetti avversi di natura neoplastica in tale categoria professionale, non essendo possibile definire una dose soglia. Nel periodo 2016 - 2019, sul territorio della provincia di Bari, è stato condotto da parte dei competenti Organi di Vigilanza un esteso piano mirato di vigilanza atto a verificare il rispetto della normativa in materia di protezione dei lavoratori da agenti cancerogeni presso gli impianti di distribuzione carburante per autotrazione. Sono stati verificati in particolare gli obblighi in materia di valutazione dei rischi, igiene dei luoghi di lavoro, monitoraggio ambientale, dispositivi di protezione individuali (DPI), sorveglianza sanitaria, monitoraggio biologico, registri di esposizione ad agenti cancerogeni. Sebbene tali obblighi siano risultati assolti dal punto di vista documentale dalla quasi totalità dei 162 impianti ispezionati nella provincia di Bari, diverse criticità sono state riscontrate nell’approccio al rischio cancerogeno, tra le quali, con maggiore frequenza,la mancanza di idonei locali ad uso spogliatoio con relativi armadietti per gli indumenti, lo scarso impiego di guanti in fase di erogazione carburante, la assenza o incompletezza dei documenti di valutazione del rischio cancerogeno, la mancata o errata esecuzione del monitoraggio biologico. Gli esiti dei monitoraggi ambientali effettuati dalle aziende confermano che le attuali esposizioni a benzene degli addetti alla distribuzione di carburante sono notevolmente al di sotto dei valori limite fissati dalla normativa italiana. L’indicatore biologico di esposizione più frequentemente utilizzato è risultato l’acido trans, trans-muconico urinario (TTMA-U). Al fine di contribuire a ridurre il più possibile i rischi per la salute per gli addetti al rifornimento di carburante, è necessaria da parte dei datori di lavoro, dei lavoratori e dei Medici competenti una maggiore attenzione ai rispettivi obblighi, con interventi correttivi o migliorativi mirati alle attività di valutazione del rischio da agenti cancerogeni, fornitura ed utilizzo dei DPI, progettazione dei luoghi di lavoro, sorveglianza sanitaria e monitoraggio biologico. Si conferma inoltre lo scarso valore del TTMA-U di fine turno quale indicatore biologico di esposizione a benzene in caso di bassi livelli espositivi.",,,,Copyright© by GIMLE.,,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Napolano', 'firstname': 'Flavio', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Azienda Sanitaria Locale di Bari, Dipartimento di Prevenzione, Servizio Prevenzione e Sicurezza degli Ambienti di Lavoro.'}, {'lastname': 'Corfiati', 'firstname': 'Marisa', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Azienda Sanitaria Locale di Bari, Dipartimento di Prevenzione, Servizio Prevenzione e Sicurezza degli Ambienti di Lavoro.'}, {'lastname': 'Vaira', 'firstname': 'Alessandro', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Azienda Sanitaria Locale di Bari, Dipartimento di Prevenzione, Servizio Prevenzione e Sicurezza degli Ambienti di Lavoro.'}, {'lastname': 'Giangaspero', 'firstname': 'Girolamo', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Azienda Sanitaria Locale di Bari, Dipartimento di Prevenzione, Servizio Prevenzione e Sicurezza degli Ambienti di Lavoro.'}, {'lastname': ""D'Ongia"", 'firstname': 'Marino', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Azienda Sanitaria Locale di Bari, Dipartimento di Prevenzione, Servizio Prevenzione e Sicurezza degli Ambienti di Lavoro.'}, {'lastname': 'Di Leone', 'firstname': 'Giorgio', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Azienda Sanitaria Locale di Bari, Dipartimento di Prevenzione, Servizio Prevenzione e Sicurezza degli Ambienti di Lavoro.'}, {'lastname': 'Trani', 'firstname': 'Giuseppe', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Azienda Sanitaria Locale di Bari, Dipartimento di Prevenzione, Servizio Prevenzione e Sicurezza degli Ambienti di Lavoro.'}, {'lastname': 'Longo', 'firstname': 'Fulvio', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Azienda Sanitaria Locale di Bari, Dipartimento di Prevenzione, Servizio Prevenzione e Sicurezza degli Ambienti di Lavoro.'}, {'lastname': 'Marcuccio', 'firstname': 'Paolo', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'Azienda Sanitaria Locale di Bari, Dipartimento di Prevenzione, Servizio Prevenzione e Sicurezza degli Ambienti di Lavoro.'}]"

The findings of quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction and methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting assays elicited that miR-424-5p was poorly expressed in HCC tissues and cells while highly methylated. Meanwhile, upon demethylation, miR-424-5p expression levels were partly recovered in HCC cells. In addition, miR-424-5p upregulation reduced cell viability and elevated apoptosis of HCC cells, in parallel with increased N-cadherin and decreased E-cadherin levels. Dual-luciferase reporter assay further validated that miR-424-5p bound to the kinesin family member 2A (KIF2A), and miR-424-5p overexpression downregulated KIF2A. In addition, KIF2A overexpression reversed the miR-424-5p-driven changes in terms of cell viability, apoptosis and EMT-related protein levels. Furthermore, xenograft tumors were established via injection of Huh7 cells, followed by miR-424-5p overexpression in vivo, which inhabited KIF2A downregulation and attenuated tumor growth along with decreased Ki67 positive expression, diminished N-cadherin and elevated E-cadherin levels. Overall, our findings supported the conclusion that miR-424-5p promoter methylation reduced miR-424-5p expression and upregulated KIF2A, thereby promoting HCC EMT.",,,,"© 2022 The Authors.

Encompass (38 patients) and DSPS (38 patients) were used for patient immobilization, and HyperArc plans with three to four non-coplanar beams were generated to deliver 25 to 35 Gy in three to five fractions. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) was performed on patients before and after the treatment. Moreover, the difference in patient position between the two CBCT images was considered as the IME. The margins to compensate for IME were calculated using the van Herk margin formula.
For Encompass, the mean values of IME in the translational setup were 0.1, 0.2, and 0.0 mm in the anterior-posterior, superior-inferior, and left-right directions, respectively, and the mean values of IME about rotational axes were -0.1, 0.0, and 0.0° for the Pitch, Roll, and Yaw rotations, respectively.

35049118,A method for time-independent film dosimetry: Can we obtain accurate patient-specific QA results at any time postirradiation?,[],Journal of applied clinical medical physics,"The aim of this work was twofold. (1) To investigate and present a comparison between EBT3 and EBT-XD in terms of postirradiation color changes. (2) Create an automated workflow to allow radiochromic film (EBT3/XD) to be scanned and converted to dose accurately at any postirradiation time.
Ten GafChromic EBT-XD calibration films were exposed in 2 Gy increments up to 18 Gy. Calibrates were then scanned at 5-min intervals postirradiation over 24 h using an AutoHotKey script, resulting in 288 TIFF images. Following the 24-h scanning period, a MATLAB script was used to automatically read the tiff images and create a series of 288 calibration curves distinct in time which is termed as the ""Temporal Calibration Model"" (TCM). The model is saved as a series of polynomial fit coefficients to net optical density as a function of dose, timestamped in 5-min increments. Ten patient-specific film measurements (5 × EBT-XD and 5 × EBT3) were then carried out and scanned using the same 5-min scan intervals from 5 min postirradiation to 24 h postirradiation. The TCM was then automatically applied using eFilmQA software to convert the patient-specific QA films to dose by applying the relevant calibration curve from the TCM, corresponding to the arbitrary postirradiation time that the film was scanned. Each dose plane at postirradiation scan intervals of 5 min up to 20 h was then compared to the ground-truth dose plane using gamma analysis.
Gamma pass rates using the TCM at time t, normalized to the pass rate after 20 h postirradiation, were found to have a maximum coefficient of variation of 3% over any postirradiation time. Conversely, not using the TCM resulted in coefficients of variation of up to 39%. Clinical implementation of this method showed an average accuracy of 2.8% when comparing the clinical result to the TCM result.
We have developed a methodology that allows radiochromic film to be accurately used as a dosimeter at any arbitrary scan postirradiation time, whereas previously, waiting periods of 16-24 h before readout were needed to ensure the postirradiation changes had stabilized. The creation of a TCM can enable results from radiochromic film measurements to be obtained quickly postirradiation. Using a conventional single calibration curve generated at 20 h postirradiation can result in gamma pass-rate difference of up to 75% for measurement films scanned at a much shorter postirradiation time.",,,"Gamma pass rates using the TCM at time t, normalized to the pass rate after 20 h postirradiation, were found to have a maximum coefficient of variation of 3% over any postirradiation time.

Our procedures have five major components: (1) acquiring both free-breathing (FB) and DIBH computed tomography (CT) at simulation to quantify the rise of the anterior surface, (2) defining uniformly a large region of interest (ROI) to accommodate large variations in patient anatomy and treatment techniques, (3) performing two-step setup in FB by first aligning the arm and chin to minimize breast deformation and reproduce local lymphnode positions and then aligning the ROI, (4) aligning the vertical shift precisely from FB to DIBH, and (5) capturing a new on-site reference image at DIBH to separate residual setup errors from the DIBH motion monitoring uncertainties. Moreover, a new clinical workflow was developed for patient data preparation using 4 OSI offline workstations without interruption of SGRT treatment at 22 OSI online workstations. This procedure/workflow is suitable for all photon planning techniques, including 2-field, 3-field, 4-field, partial breast irradiation (PBI), and volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with or without bolus.
Since 2019, we have developed and applied the uniform breast SGRT DIBH procedure with optimized clinical workflow and ensured treatment accuracy among the nine clinics within our institution. About 150 breast DIBH patients are treated daily and two major upgrades are achieved smoothly throughout our institution, owing to the uniform and versatile procedure, adequate staff training, and efficient workflow with effective clinical supports and backup strategies.
The uniform and versatile breast SGRT DIBH procedure and workflow have been developed to ensure smooth and optimal clinical operations, simplify clinical staff training and clinical troubleshooting, and allow high-quality SGRT delivery in a busy multi-center institution.","The uniform and versatile breast SGRT DIBH procedure and workflow have been developed to ensure smooth and optimal clinical operations, simplify clinical staff training and clinical troubleshooting, and allow high-quality SGRT delivery in a busy multi-center institution.",,"Since 2019, we have developed and applied the uniform breast SGRT DIBH procedure with optimized clinical workflow and ensured treatment accuracy among the nine clinics within our institution.

Communication and coordination are challenging and the patients' responsibilities to take on more active roles in their own care are increasing.
This study aimed to investigate associations between patient activation level and participation in cancer care, sociodemographic characteristics, clinical data, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and helpfulness of received information.
In this cross-sectional population-based study, patients completed questionnaires on patient activation, perceived participation, HRQoL, helpfulness of received information and sociodemographic characteristics. Responses to the patient activation measures (PAMs) were classified into four levels (higher levels indicating more activation). Data on age, sex and cancer diagnosis were collected from the Swedish Cancer Register.
Data from 682 patients were analysed. On comparing patients at PAM levels 1 and 4, the latter reported significantly higher possibilities to influence care decisions (46.6% vs. 20.8%) and to ask questions regarding treatment and care (93.4% vs. 68.4%). Patients at PAM level 4 reported wanting to influence decision-making to a higher extent, compared with patients at other PAM levels, and reported clinically significantly higher HRQoL. No significant differences were found regarding sociodemographic characteristics.
We found strong associations between perceived patient participation and activation levels, with limited possibility for participation among those with lower activation levels.
Discussions with patient representatives have raised the importance of participation. The preliminary findings were presented and discussed in a workshop with representatives from 21 cancer patient advocacy groups.","We found strong associations between perceived patient participation and activation levels, with limited possibility for participation among those with lower activation levels.",,"Data from 682 patients were analysed.

To describe the characteristics of cases with discordant T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) scores in patients with BCa and further verify the accuracy of the VI-RADS scoring system and the necessity of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) sequence.
Retrospective.
A total of 106 patients (include 16.5% female) with bladder cancer.
T2WI (fast spin echo), DWI (echo planer imaging), and DCE (gradient echo).
Some cases are difficult to score according to the system, mainly when the T2WI (category 4) and DWI (category 2) sequence scores are discordant, termed the discordant group below. The complementary group will be termed concordant group. Each MRI sequence was reviewed respectively according to the 5-point VI-RADS scoring system by three observers. The diagnostic ability of sequences for evaluating muscle invasion by BCa was calculated using histopathology as the reference standards.
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, DeLong test, intraclass correlation coefficient. A P value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant.
Fourteen cases (13.2%) had discordant VI-RADS scoring system. In the discordant group, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of DCE was 0.875, while the T2WI and DWI showed limited diagnostic performance (AUCs = 0.50). In the concordant group, there was no significant difference in diagnostic efficacy between the overall VI-RADS (AUC: 0.950) and the combination of T2WI and DWI (AUC: 0.946) (P = 0.56). Among all patients, the AUC of overall VIRADS was 0.939 with a 3 or greater cutoff value.
The DCE was crucial in the discordant group for evaluating muscle-invasiveness, while DCE may not be necessary for the concordant group. The VI-RADS scoring system performed with overall good diagnostic performance in evaluating muscle-invasiveness in BCa patients.

To investigate whether DA represents a distinct genetic subtype and to investigate the somatic relationship between the ductal and acinar components of mixed cancers.
In 17 radical prostatectomy specimens ductal and acinar tumor components from the same tumor foci were dissected. DNA was extracted and genomic sequencing performed. After exclusion of two cases with low cell yield, 15 paired samples remained for analysis.
In 12 of 15 cases a common somatic denominator was identified, while three cases had clonally separate components. In DA, TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusions were detected in 47% (7/15), clonal FOXA1 alterations in 33% (5/15) and SPOP alterations in 27% (4/15) of cases. In one case KIAA1549-BRAF fusion was identified. Genome doubling events, resulting in an increased ploidy, were identified in the DA in 53% (8/15) of cases, but not seen in any AA.

Microscopic examination of a preliminary set of five cases revealed well-delimitated tumours located in the dermis with frequent extension to the subcutaneous tissue. Tumours presented a massive and nodular architecture and consisted of a proliferation of basaloid cells. A biphasic pattern sometime resulting in tumour cell nests, (""cell balls"") was present. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the expression of cytokeratins (CK) 15, 17 and PHLDA1. In addition, numerous Cytokeratin 20-positive Merkel cells were detected. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed a FOXK1::GRHL1 chimeric transcript in 3 cases and a FOXK1::GRHL2 fusion in 2 cases. In a second series for validation (n=88), FOXK1::GRHL1/2 fusion transcripts were detected by RT-qPCR or FISH in an 12 additional trichogerminomas and not in any other follicular tumour entities or basal cell carcinoma cases (n= 66). Additional RNA-seq analysis in trichogerminoma cases without detected FOXK1::GRHL1/2 rearrangements revealed GPS2::GRHL1 fusion transcripts in two cases, GPS2::GRHL2 in one and GPS2::GRHL3 fusion transcript in one case. Therefore, our study strongly suggests that GRHL1/2/3 gene rearrangements might represent the oncogenic driver in trichogerminoma, a subset of follicular tumours characterized by immature features and numerous Merkel cells.

Both transcriptional and epigenetic aberrations are essentially connected with cancer stemness. The engagement of bromodomain (BrD) proteins - a family of epigenetic factors - has been presented in the pathogenesis of several tumor types, although their association with cancer stemness remains largely unknown. Here, we harnessed TCGA and GEO databases and used several bioinformatic tools (i.e. Oncomine, PrognoScan, GEPIA2, TIMER2.0, TISIDB, GSEA, R2 platform) to characterize the association between the BrD family members' expression and cancer stemness in solid tumors. Our results demonstrate that significant upregulation of ATAD2 and SMARCA4, and downregulation of SMARCA2 is consistently associated with enriched cancer stem cell-like phenotype, respectively.

However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Transglutaminase (TG)2 is a calcium ion (Ca2+)-dependent enzyme with an important role in neuronal cell outgrowth and differentiation and in neurotoxin activity and is modulated by organophosphates.
We studied TG2 activity modulation by CPO and PSP during differentiation in C6 glioma cells. We studied the effects of CPO or PSP treatment with or without the TG2 inhibitor Z-DON and identified potential TG2 protein substrates via mass spectrometry.
PSP and CPO did not affect cell viability but affected TG2 activity in differentiating cells. Our results indicate that the organophosphate-induced amine incorporation activity of TG2 may have a direct effect on neuronal outgrowth, differentiation, and cell survival by modifying several essential microtubule proteins, including tubulin. Inhibiting TG2 reduced neurite length but not cell survival.

However, it has not been defined as a causal side effect of cisplatin. Here we report on a patient with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer who developed a cardiotoxic event induced by cisplatin that manifested primarily as arrhythmia.
Intensive cardiac monitoring through electrocardiogram was performed to estimate the severity degree and clinical condition of arrhythmia.
The frequency and severity of the arrhythmia had a strong temporal relationship with the administration of cisplatin, that made it likely that cisplatin was responsible for the cardiotoxicity observed.
In the present case report, we discuss the potential factors that may provide pivotal contributions to the patient's susceptibility to cardiotoxicity and review the published studies regarding the cardiotoxic influence of cisplatin.

To go further into this assumption, the diagnoses made, and treatments performed at one of Germany's largest head and neck cancer centres were evaluated.
This study consisted of one single centre and involved a retrospective review of all patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent HNSCC. The diagnosis and treatment methods used in the pre-COVID-19 time period between March 1st, 2019, and March 1st, 2020, were analysed and compared with the COVID-19 time period from April 1st, 2020, until April 1st, 2021. The primary objective was defined as the number of malignant diagnoses and the secondary objectives as the disease stage and the time to therapy.
A total of 612 patients (160♀; mean 63 yrs.) were included. 319 patients (52%) were treated in the pre-COVID-19 time. The two groups did not differ in terms of age (p=0.304), gender (p=0.941), presence of recurrent disease (p=0.866), tumour subsite (p=0.194) or the duration from presentation to the multidisciplinary tumour board until start of therapy (p=0.202).

We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to estimate the causal effects of fasting insulin, 2-hour glucose, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and type-2 diabetes with colorectal cancer.
Genome-wide association study summary data were used to identify genetic variants associated with circulating levels of fasting insulin (n = 34), 2-hour glucose (n = 13), fasting glucose (n = 70), HbA1c (n = 221), and type-2 diabetes (n = 268). Using two-sample MR, we examined these variants in relation to colorectal cancer risk (48,214 cases and 64,159 controls).
In inverse-variance models, higher fasting insulin levels increased colorectal cancer risk (odds ratio [OR] per 1-standard deviation [SD]=1.65, 95% CI = 1.15-2.36). We found no evidence of any effect of 2-hour glucose (OR per 1-SD = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.86-1.21) or fasting glucose (OR per 1-SD = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.88-1.23) concentrations on colorectal cancer risk. Genetic liability to type-2 diabetes (OR per 1-unit increase in log odds = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.01-1.07) and higher HbA1c levels (OR per 1-SD = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.00-1.19) increased colorectal cancer risk, although these findings may have been biased by pleiotropy. Higher HbA1c concentrations increased rectal cancer risk in men (OR per 1-SD = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.05-1.40), but not in women.
Our results support a causal effect of higher fasting insulin, but not glucose traits or type-2 diabetes, on increased colorectal cancer risk.

35048990,Dicer dependent tRNA derived small RNAs promote nascent RNA silencing.,[],Nucleic acids research,"In mammalian cells, small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) negatively regulate gene expression in a pathway known as RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi can be categorized into post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), which involves the cleavage of target messenger RNA (mRNA) or inhibition of translation in the cytoplasm, and transcriptional gene silencing (TGS), which is mediated by the establishment of repressive epigenetic marks at target loci. Transfer RNAs (tRNAs), which are essential for translation, can be processed into small ncRNAs, termed tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs). The biogenesis of tsRNAs and their role in gene expression regulation has not yet been fully understood. Here, we show that Dicer dependent tsRNAs promote gene silencing through a mechanism distinct from PTGS and TGS. tsRNAs can lead to downregulation of target genes by targeting introns via nascent RNA silencing (NRS) in nuclei. Furthermore, we show that Ago2 slicer activity is required for this mechanism. Synthetic tsRNAs can significantly reduce expression of a target gene at both RNA and protein levels. Target genes regulated by NRS are associated with various diseases, which further underpins its biological significance. Finally, we show that NRS is evolutionarily conserved and has the potential to be explored as a novel synthetic sRNA based therapeutic.",,,,© The Author(s) 2022.

As TNGR matures, a systematic evaluation of existing processes and documents is necessary to evaluate whether the registry is operating as intended. The main supporting documents: protocol and data dictionary, were comprehensively reviewed in a series of meetings over a 10-month period by an international working group. In parallel, individual consultations with local institutions regarding a benchmarking quality-of-care report were conducted. Four consensus areas for improvement emerged: updating operational definitions, appraisal of the recruitment process, refinement of data elements, and improvement of data quality and reporting.

35048973,Variational autoencoding of gene landscapes during mouse CNS development uncovers layered roles of Polycomb Repressor Complex 2.,[],Nucleic acids research,"A prominent aspect of most, if not all, central nervous systems (CNSs) is that anterior regions (brain) are larger than posterior ones (spinal cord). Studies in Drosophila and mouse have revealed that Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 (PRC2), a protein complex responsible for applying key repressive histone modifications, acts by several mechanisms to promote anterior CNS expansion. However, it is unclear what the full spectrum of PRC2 action is during embryonic CNS development and how PRC2 intersects with the epigenetic landscape. We removed PRC2 function from the developing mouse CNS, by mutating the key gene Eed, and generated spatio-temporal transcriptomic data. To decode the role of PRC2, we developed a method that incorporates standard statistical analyses with probabilistic deep learning to integrate the transcriptomic response to PRC2 inactivation with epigenetic data. This multi-variate analysis corroborates the central involvement of PRC2 in anterior CNS expansion, and also identifies several unanticipated cohorts of genes, such as proliferation and immune response genes. Furthermore, the analysis reveals specific profiles of regulation via PRC2 upon these gene cohorts. These findings uncover a differential logic for the role of PRC2 upon functionally distinct gene cohorts that drive CNS anterior expansion. To support the analysis of emerging multi-modal datasets, we provide a novel bioinformatics package that integrates transcriptomic and epigenetic datasets to identify regulatory underpinnings of heterogeneous biological processes.",,,,© The Author(s) 2022.

35048968,TRIM21 suppresses CHK1 activation by preferentially targeting CLASPIN for K63-linked ubiquitination.,[],Nucleic acids research,"Expression of the E3 ligase TRIM21 is increased in a broad spectrum of cancers; however, the functionally relevant molecular pathway targeted by TRIM21 overexpression remains largely unknown. Here, we show that TRIM21 directly interacts with and ubiquitinates CLASPIN, a mediator for ATR-dependent CHK1 activation. TRIM21-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination of CLASPIN counteracts the K6-linked ubiquitination of CLASPIN which is essential for its interaction with TIPIN and subsequent chromatin loading. We further show that overexpression of TRIM21, but not a TRIM21 catalytically inactive mutant, compromises CHK1 activation, leading to replication fork instability and tumorigenesis. Our findings demonstrate that TRIM21 suppresses CHK1 activation by preferentially targeting CLASPIN for K63-linked ubiquitination, providing a potential target for cancer therapy.",,,,© The Author(s) 2022.

35048959,Human lactate dehydrogenase A undergoes allosteric transitions under pH conditions inducing the dissociation of the tetrameric enzyme.,"['allosteric regulation', 'enzyme kinetics', 'lactate dehydrogenase', 'lactic acid', 'liver']",Bioscience reports,"The aerobic energetic metabolism of eukaryotic cells relies on the glycolytic generation of pyruvate, which is subsequently channelled to the oxidative phosphorylation taking place in mitochondria. However, under conditions limiting oxidative phosphorylation pyruvate is coupled to alternative energetic pathways, e.g. its reduction to lactate catalysed by lactate dehydrogenases (LDHs). This biochemical process is known to induce a significant decrease of cytosolic pH, and is accordingly denoted lactic acidosis. Nevertheless, the mutual dependence of LDHs action and lactic acidosis is far from being fully understood. Using human LDH-A, here we show that when exposed to acidic pH this enzyme is subjected to homotropic allosteric transitions triggered by pyruvate. Conversely, human LDH-A features Michaelis-Menten kinetics at pH values equal to 7.0 or higher. Further, citrate, isocitrate, and malate were observed to activate human LDH-A, both at pH 5.0 and 6.5, with citrate and isocitrate being responsible for major effects. Dynamic light scattering experiments revealed that the occurrence of allosteric kinetics in human LDH-A is mirrored by a consistent dissociation of the enzyme tetramer, suggesting that pyruvate promotes tetramer association under acidic conditions. Finally, using the human liver cancer cell line HepG2 we isolated cells featuring cytosolic pH equal to 7.3 or 6.5, and we observed a concomitant decrease of cytosolic pH and lactate secretion. Overall, our observations indicate the occurrence of a negative feedback between lactic acidosis and human LDH-A activity, and a complex regulation of this feedback by pyruvate and by some intermediates of the Krebs cycle.",,,,Copyright 2022 The Author(s).,10.1042/BSR20212654,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Pasti', 'firstname': 'Alberto Pietro', 'initials': 'AP', 'affiliation': 'University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Rossi', 'firstname': 'Valentina', 'initials': 'V', 'affiliation': 'University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Di Stefano', 'firstname': 'Giuseppina', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Brigotti', 'firstname': 'Maurizio', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.'}, {'lastname': 'Hochkoeppler', 'firstname': 'Alejandro', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.'}]"
35048954,Oral Contraceptive Use in BRCA1 and BRCA2 Mutation Carriers: Absolute Cancer Risks and Benefits.,[],Journal of the National Cancer Institute,"To help BRCA1/2 mutation carriers make informed decisions regarding use of combined-type oral contraceptive preparation (COCP), absolute risk-benefit estimates are needed for COCP-associated cancer.
For a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 women, we calculated the increased or decreased cumulative incidence of COCP-associated (breast/ovarian/endometrial) cancer, examining 18 scenarios with differences in duration and timing of COCP use, uptake of prophylactic surgeries and menopausal hormone therapy.
COCP use initially increased breast cancer risk, and decreased ovarian/endometrial cancer risk long-term. For 10,000 BRCA1 mutation carriers ten years of COCP use from age 20-30 years resulted in 66 additional COCP-associated cancer cases by the age of 35 years, on top of 625 cases expected for never users. By the age of 70 years such COCP use resulted in 907 fewer cancer cases than the expected 9,093 cases in never users. Triple-negative breast cancer estimates resulted in 196 additional COCP-associated cases by age 40 years, on top of 1,454 expected. For 10,000 BRCA2 mutation carriers using COCP from age 20-30 years, 80 excess cancer cases were estimated by age 40 years on top of 651 expected cases; by the age of 70 years we calculated 382 fewer cases compared to the 6,156 cases expected. The long-term benefit of COCP use diminished after risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) followed by menopausal hormone therapy use.
While COCP use in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers initially increases breast/ovarian/endometrial cancer risk, it strongly decreases lifetime cancer risk. RRSO and menopausal hormone therapy use appear to counteract the long-term COCP-benefit.","While COCP use in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers initially increases breast/ovarian/endometrial cancer risk, it strongly decreases lifetime cancer risk.

35048945,Emulating a target trial of the comparative effectiveness of clomiphene citrate and letrozole for ovulation induction.,"['clomiphene citrate', 'infertility', 'letrozole', 'ovulation induction', 'polycystic ovarian syndrome']","Human reproduction (Oxford, England)","What are the comparative pregnancy outcomes in women who receive up to six consecutive cycles of ovulation induction with letrozole versus clomiphene citrate?
The risks of pregnancy, livebirth, multiple gestation, preterm birth, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission and congenital malformations were higher for letrozole compared with clomiphene in participants with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), though no treatment differences were observed in those with unexplained infertility.
Randomized trials have reported higher pregnancy and livebirth rates for letrozole versus clomiphene among individuals with PCOS, but no differences among those with unexplained infertility. None of these trials were designed to study maternal or neonatal complications.
We emulated a hypothetical trial of the comparative effectiveness of letrozole versus clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction among all women, then stratified by PCOS and unexplained infertility status. We used real-world data from a large healthcare claims database in the USA (2011-2015).
We analyzed data from 18 120 women who initiated letrozole and 49 647 women who initiated clomiphene during 2011-2014, and who were aged 18-45 years with no history of diabetes, thyroid disease, liver disease or breast cancer and had no fertility treatments for 3 months before trial initiation. The treatment strategies were clomiphene citrate or letrozole for six consecutive cycles. The outcomes were pregnancy, livebirth, multiple gestation, preterm birth, small for gestational age (SGA), NICU admission and major congenital malformations. We estimated the probability of each outcome under each strategy via pooled logistic regression and used standardization to adjust for confounding and selection bias due to loss to follow-up.
The estimated probabilities of pregnancy, livebirth and neonatal outcomes were similar under each strategy, both overall and among individuals with unexplained infertility. Among women with PCOS, the probability of pregnancy was 43% for letrozole vs 37% for clomiphene (risk difference [RD] = 6.0%; 95% CI: 4.4, 7.7) in the intention-to-treat analyses. The corresponding probability of livebirth was 32% vs 29% (RD = 3.1%; 95% CI: 1.5, 4.8). In per protocol analyses, the risk of multiple gestation was 19% vs 9%, the risk of preterm birth was 20% vs 15%, the risk of SGA was 5% vs 3%, the risk of NICU admission was 22% vs 16% and the risk of congenital malformation was 8% vs 2% among those with a livebirth.
We cannot completely rule out the possibility of residual confounding by body mass index or duration of infertility. However, we adjusted for proxies identified in administrative data and results did not change.
Our findings suggest that for women with unexplained infertility, the two treatments result in comparable probabilities of a livebirth. For women with PCOS, letrozole appears slightly more effective for attaining a livebirth. Neonatal outcomes were similar for the two treatments among women with unexplained infertility; we did not confirm the hypothesized higher risk of adverse neonatal outcomes for clomiphene versus letrozole. The risks of adverse neonatal outcomes were slightly greater among women with PCOS who were treated with letrozole versus clomiphene. It is likely that these effects are partially mediated through an increased risk of multiple gestation among women who received letrozole.

However, how to achieve efficient co-delivery of two or more drugs with different physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties for synergistic therapy is still a huge challenge. In particular, it is even more difficult to efficiently co-deliver a hydrophilic drug and a hydrophobic drug into one nanosystem. Herein, inspired by the natural Watson-Crick base pair molecular recognition in nucleic acids, a reduction-sensitive uracil prodrug of doxorubicin (U-SS-DOX) is synthesized and performs supramolecular co-assembly with cytarabine (Ara-C). Interestingly, the hydrophilic Ara-C molecules could readily co-assemble with U-SS-DOX, and multiple hydrogen bonds are found in the nanoassembly with an ultra-high drug loading rate. Moreover, 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindotricarbocyanine iodide (DiR) is used as a fluorescent probe to investigate the pharmacokinetics of U : C NPs. It turns out that the DiR-labeled U : C NPs significantly prolong the systemic circulation and promote the tumor-specific accumulation of DiR when compared with DiR solution. Furthermore, the supramolecular nanoassembly demonstrates potent satisfactory therapeutic effects in treating both solid and non-solid tumors ",,,,,10.1039/d1nh00590a,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Chang', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Wuya College of Innovation, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, 110016, P.

Nurses need to better understand beliefs, hopes, and values of parents to holistically support them, which may have an impact on grief and depression. Thus, the aim of this paper was to highlight the social and spiritual dimensions of parental experiences on end-of-life care of their child with cancer.
A narrative literature review was conducted by systematically searching databases (CINAHL Complete, Academic Search Elite, MEDLINE) for relevant literature. The contents of included studies were critically appraised regarding their methodological quality.
Eleven studies were included. In terms of the social dimension, three categories emerged that are important for parents: Being a Parent, Being in Relationship with the Child, and Being in Relationship with Health Professionals. Parents tried to maintain normality and joy for their child, but also kept control over the situation. They wanted to protect their child from suffering but also felt the need to talk to them about dying. Parents had ambivalent experiences with helpful but also burdensome staff. The spiritual dimension comprised two main categories, Hope and Faith and a Unique Bond. Hope was found to be an important source of strength, while Faith was only mentioned by some parents. For parents the emotional connection with their child constituted a source of meaning as well as a foundation, on which they based their decisions on.

Although the researchers have tried to minimize the conflict using statistical meta-analysis, because of its shortcomings, there is still a need to evaluate the correlation between HPV and BC using any additional method.
This study was launched to investigate the correlation between HPV and BC through the application of Bradford Hill criteria postulates.
Population-wide studies associating HPV with BC were searched using the PubMed database. Then, the information of HPV burden in BC, normal/benign samples was analyzed, and ultimately Bradford Hill criteria postulates were applied on the collected evidence to explore the relationship between HPV and BC.

TAMs constitute a major cell type of cancer-related inflammation, commonly enhancing tumor growth. They are profoundly involved in glioma pathogenesis contributing to many cancer hallmarks such as angiogenesis, survival, metastasis, and immunosuppression. Efficient targeting of TAMs presents a promising approach to tackle glioma progression. Several targeting options involve chemokine signaling axes inhibitors and antibodies, anti-angiogenic factors, immunomodulatory molecules, surface immunoglobulins blockers, receptor and transcription factor inhibitors, as well as microRNAs (miRNAs), administered either as standalones or in combination with other conventional therapies.

The hypoxic tumor is a chaotic battle and adaptive landscape. When put in hypoxic environments, cells undergo several biological reactions, including activation of signaling pathways that control proliferation, angiogenesis, and death. These pathways have been adapted by cancer cells to allow tumors to survive and even develop in hypoxic conditions, and poor prognosis is associated with tumor hypoxia. The most relevant transcriptional regulator in response to hypoxia, Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α), has been shown to modulate hypoxic gene expression and signaling transduction networks significantly. The significance of non-coding RNAs in hypoxic tumor regions has been revealed in an increasing number of studies over the past few decades. In regulating hypoxic gene expression, these hypoxia-responsive ncRNAs play pivotal roles. Hypoxia, a general characteristic of the tumor's microenvironment, significantly affects the expression of genes and is closely associated with the development of cancer. Indeed the number of known hypoxia-associated lncRNAs has increased dramatically, demonstrating the growing role of lncRNAs in cascades and responses to hypoxia signaling. Decades of research have helped us create an image of the shift in hypoxic cancer cells' DNA repair capabilities. Emerging evidence suggests that hypoxia can trigger genetic instability in cancer cells because of microenvironmental tumor stress. Researchers have found that critical genes' expression is coordinately repressed by hypoxia within the DNA damage and repair pathways. In this study, we include an update of current knowledge on the presentation, participation, and potential clinical effect of ncRNAs in tumor hypoxia, DNA damage reactions, and genomic instability, with a specific emphasis on their unusual cascade of molecular regulation and malignant progression induced by hypoxia.",,,,"Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.",10.2174/1566524022666220120123557,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Ray', 'firstname': 'Suman Kumar', 'initials': 'SK', 'affiliation': 'Independent researcher, India.'}, {'lastname': 'Mukherjee', 'firstname': 'Sukhes', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Biochemistry.

The unique traits of stem cells (SCs) such as self-renewal, differentiation, tumor tropism, the release of bioactive molecules, and immunosuppression have opened a new window for utilizing SCs as a novel tool in cancer treatment. In this regard, engineered SCs can secrete anti-cancer proteins or express enzymes used in suicide gene therapy which locally induce apoptosis in neoplastic cells via the bystander effect. These cells also stand as proper candidates to serve as careers for drug-loaded nanoparticles or to play suitable hosts for oncolytic viruses. Moreover, they harbor great potential to be employed in immunotherapy and combination therapy. However, tactful strategies should be devised to allow easier transplantation and protection of SCs from in vivo immune responses. In spite of the great hope concerning SCs application in cancer therapy, there are shortcomings and challenges to be addressed.

Our aim was to develop a CSCrelated signature to assess the prognosis of PAAD patients for the optimization of treatment.
Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between pancreatic tumor and normal tissue in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were screened out, and the weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was employed to identify the CSC-related gene sets. Then, univariate, Lasso Cox regression analyses and multivariate Cox regression were applied to construct a prognostic signature using the CSC-related genes. Its prognostic performance was validated in TCGA and ICGC cohorts. Furthermore, Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to identify independent prognostic factors in PAAD, and a prognostic nomogram was established.
The Kaplan-Meier analysis, ROC curve and C-index indicated the good performance of the CSC-related signature at predicting overall survival (OS). Univariate Cox regression and multivariate Cox regression revealed that the CSC-related signature was an independent prognostic factor in PAAD. The nomogram was superior to the risk model and AJCC stage in predicting OS. In terms of mutation and tumor immunity, patients in the high-risk group had higher tumor mutation burden (TMB) scores than patients in the low-risk group, and the immune score and the ESTIMATE score were significantly lower in the high-risk group. Moreover, according to the results of principal component analysis (PCA) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), the low-risk and high-risk groups displayed different stemness statuses based on the risk model.

Also known as type II cell death, it is a process in which cells degrade their damaged organelles and macromolecular substances by lysosomes. Autophagy is reported to be involved in the development of multiple tumor types, including esophageal carcinoma (ESCA). Autophagy-related genes (ARGs) are those genes proved to be closely related to, or in control of, autophagy. We aimed to identify a model for predicting prognosis based on ARGs, using gene expression profiles and clinical data of ESCA patients from an online database. We identified 28 ARGs as having significantly different activity in ESCA cells compared with normal cells. Among them, four genes were less active, and 24 genes were more active in cancer. Seven ARGs were screened to construct the prognostic model. The effectiveness of the model in predicting the prognosis of ESCA patients was confirmed by standard statistical methods.

Methods and Results We performed a multicenter, prospective cohort study of 3255 patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease (CAD) to investigate whether CKD modifies the prognostic utility of cardiovascular biomarkers. Serum levels of cardiovascular and renal biomarkers, including soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high-sensitivity cardiac troponin-I (hs-cTnI), cystatin C, and placental growth factor, were measured in 1301 CKD and 1954 patients without CKD. The urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) was measured in patients with CKD. The primary outcome was 3-point MACE (3P-MACE) defined as a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. The secondary outcomes were all-cause death, cardiovascular death, and 5P-MACE defined as a composite of 3P-MACE, heart failure hospitalization, and coronary/peripheral artery revascularization. After adjustment for clinical confounders, sFlt-1, NT-proBNP, and hs-cTnI, but not other biomarkers, were significantly associated with 3P-MACE, all-cause death, and cardiovascular death in the entire cohort and in patients without CKD. These associations were still significant in CKD only for NT-proBNP and hs-cTnI. NT-proBNP and hs-cTnI were also significantly associated with 5P-MACE in CKD. The UACR was not significantly associated with any outcomes in CKD. NT-proBNP and hs-cTnI added incremental prognostic information for all outcomes to the model with potential clinical confounders in CKD. Conclusions NT-proBNP and hs-cTnI were the most powerful prognostic biomarkers in patients with suspected or known CAD and concomitant CKD.",,,,,10.1161/JAHA.121.023464,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname':

35048653,Assessing aCCess to Investigations in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (ACCID): results from an international survey.,[],European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,"Multiple investigations are available to aid the diagnosis and monitoring of disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Fecal calprotectin (FC) is an established surrogate for intestinal inflammatory activity. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) including thiopurine metabolites, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels and antidrug antibody measurements are a step toward personalized medicine in IBD, but face access barriers. We aimed to assess test availability and barriers for these investigations in European practice.
Five-hundred questionnaires were distributed to workshop participants at the 11th Congress of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO). Access to FC, TDM for thiopurines and anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, as well as factors associated with usage and barriers to access were recorded.
Responses were obtained from 195 attendees from 38 countries across a range of practices, healthcare settings and levels of experience. FC was available to 92.3% while access to anti-TNF (78.9%, P = 0.02 vs.  thiopurine TDM, P = 0.0002 vs.  FC) and thiopurine TDM (67.7%, P = 0.0001) were less widespread. Cost was a frequently cited barrier to test access or usage, with access having a significant West-East and North-South divide across all three investigations. The strongest independent predictor of access to all tests was healthcare spending per capita (P = 0.005 for FC; P < 0.0001 for both TDM).
FC, anti-TNF and thiopurine TDM are increasingly incorporated as part of routine practice in IBD care across Europe and have the potential to impact positively on patient care. However, access barriers remain of which we found test cost the most significant with the investment required to reduce these barriers.","FC, anti-TNF and thiopurine TDM are increasingly incorporated as part of routine practice in IBD care across Europe and have the potential to impact positively on patient care.

Although the coexistence pattern of neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine components in definitive MiNEN is thought to overlap, there may be a coexistent pattern of both components, such as superficial carcinoma adjacent to NEN. The present study evaluated the histopathological findings of the coexistence pattern of superficial carcinomas adjacent to NENs in the esophagogastrointestinal tract.
From 2000 to 2019, 35 serial NEN resections of the esophagus (n = 9), stomach (n = 3), and large intestine (n = 23), respectively, were performed at Gunma University Hospital. Borderline areas between NEN and resident superficial epithelium were observed in the 35 serial NEN cases as well as two additional cases from affiliated hospitals.
Among the 35 serial NEN samples, squamous cell carcinomatous/dysplastic components were identified 77.8% (7/9 cases) of esophageal NENs, and adenocarcinomatous areas were seen in 66.7% (2/3 cases) of gastric NENs and 26% (6/23 cases) of colorectal NENs. Thus, all superficial carcinomatous components adjacent to NENs were observed as squamous cell carcinoma/dysplasia in esophagus and adenocarcinoma in stomach and large intestine, which showed histological characteristics as the resident epithelial pattern in each organ.

Curzerene can inhibit the progression of non-small-cell lung cancer, but its role in glioma has not been reported. The purpose of this study was to clarify the effect of curzerene on glioma progression and further explore its potential mechanism.
The expression of glutathione S-transferase A4 (GSTA4) in glioblastoma and the effect of curzerene on the expression of GSTA4 and matrix metalloproteinase 9 and the activation of the mTOR pathway were detected by Western blotting and RT-PCR, and the effects of curzerene treatment on glioma malignant character were detected by cell biological assays. The in vivo antitumor effects of curzerene were analyzed in a nude mouse xenograft model.
Curzerene was found to inhibit the expression of GSTA4 mRNA and protein in U251 and U87 glioma cells, and this effect correlated with a downregulation of the proliferation of these cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Invasion and migration were also inhibited, and curzerene treatment correlated with induction of apoptosis. Curzerene inhibited the activation of the mTOR pathway and the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9, and it correlated with increased 4-hydroxynonenal levels. In vivo, curzerene was found to significantly inhibit tumor growth in nude mice and to prolong the survival time of tumor-bearing nude mice.
In conclusion, inhibition of GSTA4 correlates with positive outcomes in glioma models, and thus, this molecule is a candidate drug for the treatment of glioma.","In conclusion, inhibition of GSTA4 correlates with positive outcomes in glioma models, and thus, this molecule is a candidate drug for the treatment of glioma.",,"Curzerene was found to inhibit the expression of GSTA4 mRNA and protein in U251 and U87 glioma cells, and this effect correlated with a downregulation of the proliferation of these cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner.

While defects in gene expression and RNA metabolism have been linked with age-associated human neuropathies, it is not clear how the changes that occur in aging neurons contribute to loss of gene expression homeostasis. R-loops are RNA-DNA hybrids that typically form co-transcriptionally via annealing of the nascent RNA to the template DNA strand, displacing the non-template DNA strand. Dysregulation of R-loop homeostasis has been associated with both transcriptional impairment and genome instability. Importantly, a growing body of evidence links R-loop accumulation with cellular dysfunction, increased cell death, and chronic disease onset. Here, we characterized the R-loop landscape in aging Drosophila melanogaster photoreceptor neurons and showed that bulk R-loop levels increased with age. Further, genome-wide mapping of R-loops revealed that transcribed genes accumulated R-loops over gene bodies during aging, which correlated with decreased expression of long and highly expressed genes. Importantly, while photoreceptor-specific down-regulation of Top3β, a DNA/RNA topoisomerase associated with R-loop resolution, lead to decreased visual function, over-expression of Top3β or nuclear-localized RNase H1, which resolves R-loops, enhanced positive light response during aging.

Accumulating evidence has demonstrated the roles of circular RNAs in cancer. This study aimed to investigate the expression and function of circFAM64A in TNBC. The GSE101124 dataset from the GEO database was examined to identify the differentially expressed circular RNAs in TNBC. RT-qPCR and western blot analyses were performed to measure gene expression. TNBC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and cell cycle were assessed using cell counting kit-8, EdU, flow cytometry, wound healing, and transwell invasion experiments. Bioinformatics analysis, RIP, RNA pulldown, and luciferase reporter assays were used to investigate the regulatory mechanism of circFAM64A. In this study, CircFAM64A expression was significantly upregulated in TNBC tissues and cells compared with normal tissues and cells. Overexpression of circFAM64A increased the proliferative, migratory, and invasive capacities of TNBC cells and promoted cell cycle progression. Mechanistically, circFAM64A acted as a molecular sponge for miR-149-5p, and miR-149-5p directly targeted the Cdc10-dependent transcript 1 (CDT1) 3'UTR. Moreover, the high expression of CDT1 is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. Rescue experiments demonstrated that circFAM64A sponged miR-149-5p to increase CDT1 expression, thereby promoting cellular processes in TNBC. Overall, CircFAM64A plays an oncogenic role in TNBC by interacting with miR-149-5p to increase CDT1 expression.",,,,© 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.,10.1002/tox.23466,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Maimaiti', 'firstname': 'Yusufu', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': ""Department of Breast and Thyroid Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.\nDepartment of General Surgery, People's Hospital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Xinjiang, China.""}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Ning', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Breast and Thyroid Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Yunke', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Breast and Thyroid Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhou', 'firstname': 'Jing', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Breast and Thyroid Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Song', 'firstname': 'Haiping', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Breast and Thyroid Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Shuntao', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Department of Breast and Thyroid Surgery, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China.'}]"

Two daylong audio recordings were collected on weekends, when both parents were at home. Paternal, maternal, and infant speech variables were quantified through automatic and manual analyses. Most infants experienced Spanish and English within child-directed speech, and language mixing was common in mothers and fathers. Adjusting for demographic variables, infants heard 50.4% less talk from men compared to women, and 43.4% less parentese from fathers compared to mothers. However, when controlling for overall speech amount, the rate of parentese use did not differ between mothers and fathers, demonstrating that, contrary to the stereotype, fathers in Latinx families adjust their speech in verbal interactions with their infants. An asymmetry emerged, where paternal parentese was associated with paternal knowledge of language development but not with paternal involvement in childcare responsibilities; the opposite was true for paternal speech amount. Controlling for maternal contributions, paternal parentese was predictive of concurrent parent-infant turn-taking and infant language vocalizations, demonstrating its important role in infant language development.",,,,© 2022 International Congress of Infant Studies.,10.1111/infa.12450,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Ferjan Ramírez', 'firstname': 'Naja', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Department of Linguistics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Hippe', 'firstname': 'Daniel S', 'initials': 'DS', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Correa', 'firstname': 'Lili', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Department of Linguistics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Andert', 'firstname': 'Josephine', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.'}, {'lastname': 'Baralt', 'firstname': 'Melissa', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Department of Modern Languages, Center for Children and Families, Florida International University, Miami, Florida, USA.'}]"

This study is targeted at exploring the effect of circ_0002623 on bladder cancer (BCa) progression and its mechanism. Circ_0002623 was screened out by analyzing the expression profile of circRNAs in BCa tissues. Circ_0002623, miR-1276 and SMAD2 mRNA expression levels in clinical sample tissues and cell lines were detected through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). After circ_0002623 was overexpressed or silenced in BCa cells, the cell proliferation, migration and cell cycle were evaluated by CCK-8, BrdU, Transwell assay and flow cytometry. Tumor xenograft model was used to validate the biological function of circ_0002623 in vivo. Bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay were conducted for analyzing and confirming, respectively, the targeted relationship between circ_0002623 and miR-1276, as well as between miR-1276 and SMAD2. The regulatory effects of circ_0002623 and miR-1276 on the expression levels of TGF-β, WNT1 and SMAD2 in BCa cells were detected by Western blot. We reported that, in BCa tissues and cell lines, circ_0002623 was up-regulated, whereas miR-1276 was down-regulated. Circ_0002623 positively regulated BCa cell proliferation, migration and cell cycle progression. Additionally, circ_0002623 could competitively bind with miR-1276 to increase the expression of SMAD2, the target gene of miR-1276. Furthermore, circ_0002623 could regulate the expression of TGF-β and WNT1 via modulating miR-1276 and SMAD2.

Nevertheless, perceived stigma is not very well understood in Asia. This study investigated across six developing Asian countries: 1) the prevalence of perceived stigma among advanced cancer patients, 2) its risk factors, and 3) its association with patient treatment preferences.
This cross-sectional study recruited patients receiving oncology care across major hospitals in Bangladesh, China, India, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Vietnam. Participants (N = 1358) were adults diagnosed with stage IV metastatic solid cancer who completed self-reported surveys. Multi-variable logistic regression and ordered logit models examined the associations with perceived stigma and variables of interest.
Across the countries, 35%, 95% CI [32%, 38%] of patients reported experiencing at least one facet of cancer-related stigma often or always, while 60% [57%, 63%] reported it occurring occasionally. Top-endorsed facets of perceived stigma across the Asian countries suggest a distinct pattern. Having knowingly engaged in health-risk behaviours (OR = 2.03-2.24, 95% CI [1.14-1.19, 3.43-4.41]), unemployment (2.64 [1.67, 4.19]) and body image change (1.57 [1.00, 2.45]) were associated with higher odds of perceived stigma, while time mitigated perceived stigma (0.49-0.65 [0.30-0.45, 0.76-0.92]). Perceived stigma was associated with lower odds of preference for life-extending treatments, although the associations did not hold up in the adjusted model.

In this study, we examined CBX3 protein expression in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded normal mucosae, hyperplastic polyps, low-and high-grade adenomas, and CRC tissue samples using immunohistochemistry. The associations of CBX3 expression levels with clinicopathological parameters, mismatch repair (MMR) protein expression, and kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) and B-raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) mutations were analyzed. Our results showed that CBX3 protein was negatively expressed in normal mucosae and hyperplastic polyps, as well as in most low-grade adenomas. Interestingly, CBX3 protein was positively expressed in most high-grade adenomas and CRC tissues. CBX3 expression level was associated with tumor differentiation (p = 0.012), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.024), TNM stage (p = 0.008) and survival (p = 0.029). CBX3 expression was associated with MMR protein expression (p = 0.011) and KRAS mutation (p = 0.013), but not with BRAF mutation (p = 0.097).

We report the first crystal structure of PfPMX zymogen containing a novel fold of its prosegment. A unique twisted loop from the prosegment and arginine 244 from the mature enzyme are involved in zymogen inactivation; such mechanism, not previously reported, might be common for apicomplexan proteases similar to PfPMX. The maturation of PfPMX zymogen occurs through cleavage of its prosegment at multiple sites. Our data provide thorough insights into the mode of binding of a substrate and a potent inhibitor 49c to PfPMX. We present molecular details of inactivation, maturation, and inhibition of PfPMX that should aid in the development of potent inhibitors against pepsin-like aspartic proteases from apicomplexan parasites.

MNKs regulate eIF4E phosphorylation and activity in tumor but not normal cells, and are potentially safe targets for the treatment of various cancers. Our work reveals that tomivosertib, a potent and highly selective dual MNK1/2 inhibitor, preferentially sensitizes gastric cancer to chemotherapy via suppressing MNK-eIF4E-β-catenin. We firstly demonstrate that tomivosertib displays higher efficacy than other MNK inhibitors in inhibiting gastric cancer cells. In addition, tomivosertib significantly augments the inhibitory effects of 5-FU and paclitaxel but not everolimus, suggesting that tomivosertib preferentially sensitizes gastric cancer to chemotherapy. We next show that eIF4E overexpression and phosphorylation coordinately regulate β-catenin signaling in gastric cancer. Rescue studies confirm that tomivosertib inhibits gastric cancer via targeting MNK- eIF4E-β-catenin. Finally, we demonstrate that the in vitro functional and mechanism observations are translatable to in vivo gastric cancer model in mice. Tomivosertib is now in phase 2 clinical trials.

However, its precise function and the relevant molecular mechanism in breast cancer have not yet been elucidated. In this study, analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data revealed that MARK2 expression was markedly upregulated in breast cancer tissues, and high expression of MARK2 was correlated with poor survival. Functional assays showed that MARK2 deletion or inhibition suppressed aerobic glycolysis and cell growth as well as induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, MARK2 stimulates mTOR-mediated hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) transcription activity and represses p53-transcription activity in breast cancer cells. TCGA data revealed that MARK2 expression was positively correlated with mTOR, Raptor, S6K1, glucose transporter 1, lactate dehydrogenase, HIF-1α, and 4E-BP1 expression, whereas negatively correlated with p53, p21, and Bax in breast cancer tissue.

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is one such progressive and fatal interstitial fibrotic disease that is often characterized by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins leading to stiff lung tissue and impaired gas exchange. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying IPF progression remain largely unknown. In this study, we determined the role of Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor, in the differentiation of human lung fibroblasts (HLFs) in vitro and in an animal model of bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis. We observed that the expression of RUNX1 was significantly increased in the lungs of BLM-injected mice as compared to saline-treated mice. Furthermore, HLFs stimulated with transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) showed significantly higher RUNX1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, and compartmentalization in the nucleus. Inhibition of RUNX1 in HLFs (using siRNA) showed a significant reduction in the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts as evidenced by reduced expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), TGF-β and ECM proteins such as fibronectin 1 (FN1), and collagen 1A1 (COL1A1). Mechanistic studies revealed that the increased expression of RUNX1 in TGF-β-stimulated lung fibroblasts is due to enhanced mRNA stability of RUNX1 through selective interaction with the RNA-binding profibrotic protein, human antigen R (HuR). Collectively, our data demonstrate that increased expression of RUNX1 augments processes involved in lung fibrosis including the differentiation of fibroblasts into collagen-synthesizing myofibroblasts.

VAS design objectives included: 1) robust and atraumatic fixation elements, 2) kink resistant conduit to adjust to fetal movement and growth, 3) one-way pressure valve to facilitate bladder cycling, and 4) echogenic deployment visualization aids. The force to dislodge the novel Vortex shunt was compared with existing commercially available shunts in a bench-top porcine bladder model. Sonographic echogenicity was evaluated with ultrasound-guided deployment, and the shunt valve pressure measured.
A prototype novel Vortex shunt was developed using braided nitinol ""umbrella-type"" ends with a kink-resistant stem incorporating an internal one-way valve. The peak force required to dislodge the Vortex shunt was significantly higher than commercially available shunts (p<0.01). Shunt deployment in the bench-top model was easily confirmed with ultrasound guidance and the brisk decompression of the inflated porcine bladder thereafter. In-vitro valve gauge pressure testing mirrored bladder pressures in human LUTO cases.
In-vitro testing shows that the Vortex shunt may improve deployment, sonographic visualization, kink resistance, and dynamic size adjustment.

35048372,Evolutionary diversification of the canonical Wnt signaling effector TCF/LEF in chordates.,"['\nCiona\n', 'amphioxus', 'comparative genomics', 'cyclostome', 'lamprey']","Development, growth & differentiation","Wnt signaling is essential during animal development and regeneration, but also plays an important role in diseases such as cancer and diabetes. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway is one of the most conserved signaling cascades in the animal kingdom, with the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) proteins the major mediators of Wnt/β-catenin-regulated gene expression. In comparison to invertebrates, vertebrates possess a high diversity of TCF/LEF family genes, implicating this as a possible key change to Wnt signaling at the evolutionary origin of vertebrates. However, the precise nature of this diversification is only poorly understood. The aim of this study is to clarify orthology, paralogy and isoform relationships within the TCF/LEF gene family within chordates via in silico comparative study of TCF/LEF gene structure, molecular phylogeny and gene synteny. Our results support the notion that the four TCF/LEF paralog subfamilies in jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) evolved via the two rounds of whole-genome duplication that occurred during early vertebrate evolution. Importantly, gene structure comparisons and synteny analysis of jawless vertebrate (cyclostome) TCFs suggest that a TCF7L2-like form of gene structure is a close proxy for the ancestral vertebrate structure. In conclusion, we propose a detailed evolutionary path based on a new pre-whole-genome duplication vertebrate TCF gene model. This ancestor gene model highlights the chordate and vertebrate innovations of TCF/LEF gene structure, providing the foundation for understanding the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in vertebrate evolution.",,,,This article is protected by copyright.

We examined associations of self-reported walking pace with risk of incident HF and HF subtypes of preserved (HFpEF) and reduced (HFrEF) ejection fractions, among 25,183 postmenopausal women, ages 50-79 years. At enrollment into the Women's Health Initiative cohort in 1993-1998, this subset of women was free of HF, cancer, or the inability to walk one block, with self-reported information on walking pace and walking duration. Multivariable Cox regression was used to examine associations of walking pace (casual <2 mph [referent], average 2-3 mph, and fast >3 mph) with incident HF. We also examined the joint association of walking pace and duration with incident HF.
There were 1455 incident adjudicated acute decompensated HF hospitalization cases during a median of 16.9 years of follow-up. There was a strong inverse association between walking pace and overall risk of HF (HR = 0.73, 95% CI [0.65, 0.83] for average vs. casual walking; HR = 0.66, 95%CI [0.56, 0.78] for fast vs. casual walking). There were similar associations of walking pace with HFpEF (HR = 0.73, 95%CI [0.62, 0.86] average vs. casual; HR = 0.63, 95%CI [0.50, 0.80] for fast vs. casual) and with HFrEF (HR = 0.72, 95%CI [0.57, 0.91] for average vs. casual; HR = 0.74, 95%CI [0.54, 0.99] for fast vs. casual). The risk of HF associated with fast walking with less than 1 h/week walking duration was comparable with the risk of HF among casual and average walkers with more than 2 h/week walking duration.
Walking pace was inversely associated with risks of overall HF, HFpEF, and HFrEF in postmenopausal women. Whether interventions to increase the walking pace in older adults will reduce HF risk and whether fast pace will compensate for the short duration of walking warrants further study.","Walking pace was inversely associated with risks of overall HF, HFpEF, and HFrEF in postmenopausal women.

We postulate that individualized dosing reduces the incidence of neutropenia. The aims of this study were to 1) investigate the costs of pemetrexed-related neutropenia and 2) to determine the pharmacoeconomic benefits of individualized dosing of pemetrexed in terms of budget impact, yearly cost savings and reduction in severe neutropenia. Retrospective data on the treatment of ≥grade 3 neutropenia during pemetrexed-based chemotherapy were collected from three Dutch hospitals to determine the mean health care consumption during a neutropenic episode. Subsequently, Monte Carlo simulations were performed using a validated pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model to predict the neutropenia incidence during four cycles for standard dosing of pemetrexed and individualized dosing. The mean costs per neutropenia and the expected neutropenia incidence were combined to calculate the budget impact and cost savings. We found that the average costs per pemetrexed-associated neutropenic episode to be € 1,490. The neutropenia incidence for the standard and individualized pemetrexed dosing strategies were 12.7 and 9.9%, respectively. This resulted in total expected neutropenia-related costs of approximately € 3.0 million and €2.4 million, respectively. Taking the number of patients eligible for pemetrexed treatment into account, individualized dosing could result in saving €686,000 on a yearly basis in the Netherlands alone.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are defined as core regulators in the occurrence and progression of multiple cancers, including gastric carcinoma. Mounting evidence has indicated that NR2F2-AS1 can inhibit several malignant tumors. However, the function and potential mechanism of NR2F2-AS1 remain unclear. In the current study, we found that NR2F2-AS1 was weakly expressed in gastric cancer cells in comparison with normal cells. The study has further disclosed that ectopic of NR2F2-AS1 repressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT whereas it promoted cell apoptosis in gastric carcinoma. Subsequently, our results confirmed that miR-320b was negatively regulated and that suppression of miR-320b alleviated the malignant behaviors of GC cells. More importantly, PDCD4 was a target of miR-320b. Mechanistically, NR2F2-AS1 modulated the expression level of PDCD4 by sponging miR-320b. Finally, rescue assays demonstrated that NR2F2-AS1 down-regulated PDCD4 expression to restrain the development of gastric cancer by competitively binding to miR-320b.

35048333,Identification and differential expression of microRNAs in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells with high and low tumorigenicities.,"['MDCK cells', 'Sequence capture', 'Tumorigenicity', 'miRNA expression']",Genes & genomics,"Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells are widely used for vaccine production, however, the safety of MDCK cells needs to be considered seriously because of high tumorigenicity. Micro RNAs (miRNAs) that are involved in the tumorigenicity of MDCK cells have been never been reported.
To reveal the role of miRNA in the tumorigenic phenotype of MDCK cell line.
The miRNA expression profiles of two monoclonal MDCK cells (M09CL and M35CL) with low tumorigenicity and one MDCK cell line (M73P) with high tumorigenicity were characterized and investigated by using small RNA-seq technology.
A total of 5 known miRNAs and 5 novel miRNAs were highly expressed in M73P. In addition, 4 known miRNAs and 4 novel miRNAs were highly expressed in M09CL and M35CL. The target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs were significantly enriched in several biological processes, and the majority of these genes were involved in pathways in cancer and the MAPK signaling pathway. Through interaction analysis, 4 up-regulated miRNAs (cfa-miR-452, cfa-miR-8826, cfa-miR-224, and cfa-miR-2387) and their crucial target genes related to the tumor regulation network were identified. Results indicated these 4 miRNAs might play crucial roles in the tumorigenesis of MDCK cells.
Our findings, which were based on the functional prediction of miRNAs and target genes, suggested that miRNAs might influence the tumorigenicity of MDCK cells by regulating target genes. Moreover, the results provided important data for understanding the miRNA-mediated regulatory networks that control the tumorigenicities of MDCK cells.","Our findings, which were based on the functional prediction of miRNAs and target genes, suggested that miRNAs might influence the tumorigenicity of MDCK cells by regulating target genes.

Through interaction analysis, 4 up-regulated miRNAs (cfa-miR-452, cfa-miR-8826, cfa-miR-224, and cfa-miR-2387) and their crucial target genes related to the tumor regulation network were identified. Results indicated these 4 miRNAs might play crucial roles in the tumorigenesis of MDCK cells.",© 2021.

35048322,Two cases of pancreatic colloid carcinoma with different pathogenesis: case report and review of the literature.,"['Adenocarcinoma derived from intraductal papillary neoplasm', 'Pancreatic colloid carcinoma', 'Pancreatic cystic tumor']",Clinical journal of gastroenterology,"The two patterns of pathogenesis for pancreatic colloid carcinoma are reported; (1) progression from ordinary ductal adenocarcinoma, a subtype of invasive pancreatic ductal carcinoma, and (2) progression from papillary adenocarcinoma derived from intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) or mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN). Whether these two conditions are the same disease remains controversial. Case Report 1. An 81-year-old woman was evaluated for an increased carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) value (130 U/mL) detected at 4-year follow-up after distal pancreatectomy for IPMN. Based on the image findings, a local recurrence of IPMN was diagnosed, and the patient underwent a remnant total pancreatectomy. Histopathologic findings showed marked mucus production from the tumor, also noteworthy because mucous nodule formation occurs in more than 80% of tumor. Fibrosis around the mucous cavity was noted, and a low papillary lesion was found in part of the cyst wall, which was contiguous to a flat, basal area; its nucleus was enlarged and heterogeneous in size, which is considered to be a component of intraductal papillary mucinous (IPMC). Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with pancreatic colloid carcinoma derived from IPMN. Case report 2 a 71-year-old man was evaluated for jaundice. Based on the image findings, a diagnosis of pancreatic head cancer was made, and a substomach preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. Histologically, marked mucus production and floating cuboidal masses of atypical cells without mucinous nodules were seen. Mucinous nodule formation is observed in more than 80% of tumor, but there was no IPMN component, which led to the diagnosis of pancreatic colloid carcinoma. In conclusion, there might be two types of colloid carcinoma of the pancreas, and further study is needed to determine whether these diseases are truly the same or not.",,,,© 2021.

35048316,Preliminary Effects of Mindfulness Training on Inflammatory Markers and Blood Pressure in Young Adult Survivors of Cancer: Secondary Analysis of a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial.,"['Biomarkers', 'Blood pressure', 'Cytokines', 'Mindfulness', 'Neoplasms', 'Young adult']",International journal of behavioral medicine,"This was a secondary analysis of a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) among young adult (YA) survivors of cancer, which showed preliminary evidence for improving psychosocial outcomes. Secondary outcomes assessed were the feasibility of collecting biological data from YAs and preliminary effects of MBSR on markers of inflammation and cardiovascular function.
Participants were randomized to 8-week MBSR or a waitlist control condition. Participants provided whole blood spot samples for analysis of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6 as well as blood pressure data in-person at baseline and 16-week follow-up. Feasibility was assessed with rates of providing biological data. Linear mixed effects modeling was used to evaluate preliminary effects of MBSR on inflammatory markers and blood pressure over time.
Of 126 total participants enrolled, 77% provided biological data at baseline (n = 48/67 MBSR, n = 49/59 control). At 16 weeks, 97% of the 76 retained participants provided follow-up biological data (n = 34/35 MBSR, n = 40/41 control). Relative to the control group, MBSR was associated with decreased systolic blood pressure (p = 0.042, effect sizes (ES) = 0.45) and decreased diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.017, ES = 0.64). There were no changes in CRP or IL-6.
This was the first study to explore the feasibility of collecting biological data from YA survivors of cancer and assess preliminary effects of MBSR on inflammatory and cardiovascular markers in an RCT. Minimally invasive biological data collection methods were feasible. Results provide preliminary evidence for the role of MBSR in improving cardiovascular outcomes in this population, and results should be replicated.","This was the first study to explore the feasibility of collecting biological data from YA survivors of cancer and assess preliminary effects of MBSR on inflammatory and cardiovascular markers in an RCT.

There is an urgent need for controlling lymph node metastasis, but it has proven challenging so far. Here, we implemented LASSO analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas database to identify genes related to lymph node metastasis and prognosis, and 15 genes were selected. We constructed a functional protein association network and univariate Cox regression to identify significant genes. The results showed that BAHD1 could be predictive of lymph node metastasis as well as prognosis. In vitro studies demonstrated that BAHD1 exerted appreciable effects on the proliferation, migration, and invasion capacity of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, downregulation of BAHD1 induced cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. Additionally, the mRNA levels of CCND1, CDK1 and YWHAZ were decreased upon BAHD1 silencing. These findings indicate that the expression of BAHD1 is essential in the progression of breast cancer, which may provide novel therapeutic and diagnostic clues and insights into the prevention of lymph node metastasis in breast cancer.",,,,"© 2022.

35048281,Arthrospira platensis-Mediated Green Biosynthesis of Silver Nano-particles as Breast Cancer Controlling Agent: In Vitro and In Vivo Safety Approaches.,"['AgNPs', 'Anti-proliferative', 'Anticancer', 'Breast cancer', 'Green synthesis']",Applied biochemistry and biotechnology,"Biogenic silver nanoparticles (bio-AgNPs) is one of the most fascinating nanomaterials used for several biomedical purposes. In the current study, we biosynthesized AgNPs (bio-AgNPs) using Arthrospira platensis (A-bio-AgNPs), Microcystis aeruginosa (M-bio-AgNPs), and Chlorella vulgaris (C-bio-AgNPs) active metabolites and evaluated their anticancer efficacy against breast cancer. The recovered bio-AgNPs were characterized using scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM). In addition, their safety profiles were monitored in vitro on PBMCs cells and in vivo on Albino mice. The obtained results indicated the safety usage of bio-AgNPs at concentrations of 0.1 mg/ml on PBMCs cells and 1.5 mg/ml on the Albino mice. The bio-AgNPs displayed dose-dependent cytotoxic effects against HepG-2, CaCO-2, and MCF-7 cell lines by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and arresting the treated cells in G0/G1 and sub G0 phases. In addition, A-bio-AgNPs induced breast cancer cellular apoptosis by downregulating the expression of survivin, MMP7, TGF, and Bcl2 genes. Upon A-bio-AgNPs treatment, a significant reduction in tumor growth and prolonged survival rates were recorded in breast cancer BALB/c model. Furthermore, A-bio-AgNPs treatment significantly decreased the Ki-67 protein marker from 60% (in the untreated group) to 20% (in the treated group) and increased caspase-3 protein levels to 65% (in treated groups) comparing with 45% (in doxorubicin-treated groups).",,,,"© 2021.

35048270,Systemic Essential Metal and Metalloid Levels in Patients with Benign Breast Disease and Breast Cancer.,"['Breast tumors', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Copper', 'Fibrocystic disease', 'Manganese']",Biological trace element research,"The objective of the present study is evaluation of serum and hair levels of essential metals and metalloids in women with benign breast disease and breast cancer in order to define similar and distinct patterns that may mediate the link between these pathologies. A total of 310 adult women aged 20-80 years old were enrolled in the present study. Of those, 103 patients had benign (fibrocystic) breast disease, 107 patients had breast cancer (stage II), and 100 women were healthy and with absence of breast pathology. Trace metal and metalloid levels in hair and serum were evaluated by inductively coupled argon plasma mass-spectrometry (ICP-MS). The data demonstrate that breast cancer patients were characterized by significantly higher hair Cr and V levels, as well as reduced Cu and Mn content as compared to both benign breast disease patients and controls. In contrast, serum Cu levels in women with breast cancer exceeded those in the controls and benign breast disease cases. Patients with both benign and malignant breast tumors were characterized by lower serum Mn levels as compared to the control values. Serum Cu/Zn and especially Cu/Mn were found to be significantly increased in cancer patients. Significantly reduced hair and serum Se levels were noted only in women with fibrocystic disease. Based on the analysis of two biosamples, it is proposed that malignant breast tumor development is associated with the reduction of systemic Mn and Zn levels, and a concomitant elevation of Cu concentrations.",,,,"© 2022.

For in vitro experiments, T24 cells were stimulated with Andro (0-40 µmol/L) and 5637 cells were stimulated with Andro (0 to 80 µmol/L). Cell growth, migration, and infiltration were assessed using cell counting kit-8, colony formation, wound healing, and transwell assays. Apoptosis rate was examined using flow cytometry. In in vivo study, the antitumor effect of Andro (10 mg/kg) was evaluated by 5637 tumor-bearing mice, and levels of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT related-proteins were determined by immunoblotting.
Andro suppressed growth, migration, and infiltraion of bladder cancer cells (P⩽0.05 or P⩽0.01). Additionally, Andro induced intrinsic mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in bladder cancer cell lines. Furthermore, Andro inhibited bladder cancer growth in mice (P⩽0.01). The expression of p65, p-AKT were suppressed by Andro treatment in vitro and in vivo (P⩽0.05 or P⩽0.01).

35048234,The Optimized Formulation of Tamoxifen-Loaded Niosomes Efficiently Induced Apoptosis and Cell Cycle Arrest in Breast Cancer Cells.,"['apoptosis induction', 'breast cancer', 'nano drug-delivery', 'tamoxifen']",AAPS PharmSciTech,"The aim, as proof of concept, was to optimize niosomal formulations of tamoxifen in terms of size, morphology, encapsulation efficiency, and release kinetics for further treatment of the breast cancer (BC). Different assays were carried out to evaluate the pro-apoptotic and cytotoxicity impact of tamoxifen-loaded niosomes in two BC cells, MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3. In this study, tamoxifen was loaded in niosomes after optimization in the formulation. The formulation of niosomes supported maximized drug entrapment and minimized their size. The novel formulation showed improvement in storage stability, and after 60 days only, small changes in size, polydispersity index, and drug entrapment were observed. Besides, a pH-dependent release pattern of formulated niosomes displayed slow release at physiological pH (7.4) and a considerable increase of release at acidic pH (5.4), making them a promising candidate for drug delivery in the BC treatment. The cytotoxicity study exhibited high biocompatibility with MCF10A healthy cells, while remarkable inhibitory effects were observed after treatment of cancerous lines, MDA-MB-231, and SKBR3 cells. The IC50 values for the tamoxifen-loaded niosomes were significantly less than other groups. Moreover, treatment with drug-loaded niosomes significantly changed the gene expression pattern of BC cells. Statistically significant down-regulation of cyclin D, cyclin E, VEGFR-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 genes and up-regulation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 were observed. These results were in correlation with cell cycle arrest, lessoned migration capacity, and increased caspase activity and apoptosis induction in cancerous cells. Optimization in the formulation of tamoxifen-loaded niosomes can make them a novel candidate for drug delivery in BC treatment.",,,,"© 2022.

35048224,Effectiveness of Lenvatinib Versus Sorafenib for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Patients with Hepatic Decompensation.,"['Chemotherapy', 'Child–Pugh classification', 'Liver cancer', 'Survival', 'Targeted therapy']",Digestive diseases and sciences,"Lenvatinib and sorafenib are currently available to treat patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, since the clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of lenvatinib and sorafenib included only patients with Child-Pugh class A, little is known about the effectiveness of the treatments in patients with hepatic decompensation. We compared the effectiveness of lenvatinib and sorafenib in decompensated patients with unresectable HCC.
Consecutive patients who were classified as Child-Pugh class B or C and received lenvatinib or sorafenib as first-line systemic therapy for unresectable HCC between November 2018 and April 2020 at a tertiary referral center were included in this retrospective study. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), and the secondary outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS), time-to-progression, best overall tumor response, and safety profiles.
Among 94 patients, 34 received lenvatinib and 60 received sorafenib. The median OS was 4.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9-5.2): 4.2 months (95% CI, 2.9-5.3) for lenvatinib and 4.1 months (95% CI, 2.7-6.4) for sorafenib. The treatment regimen was not associated with significant improvement in OS after adjusting for covariables (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.92; 95% CI, 0.54-1.54; P = 0.74). The treatment regimen was not an independent predictor of PFS (lenvatinib vs. sorafenib; aHR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.48-1.24; P = 0.28). HRs were maintained even after balancing with the inverse probability treatment weighting method. Objective response rates were 11.8% and 6.7% in patients receiving lenvatinib and sorafenib, respectively (P = 0.45). Ten patients in both groups (five in the lenvatinib group and five in the sorafenib group) underwent dose modification due to adverse events, and significant difference was not observed between the treatment groups (P = 0.49).

We hypothesized that the time trends of benign colonic precursor lesions would reveal similar patterns.
The present study was designed to test this hypothesis in a large nationwide sample of the US population undergoing colonoscopy in community-based endoscopy centers.
The Inform Diagnostics database is an electronic repository of histopathologic records of patients distributed throughout the USA. A cross-sectional study analyzed the detection rates of sessile serrated adenomas (SSA), hyperplastic polyps (HP), tubular adenomas (TA), traditional serrated adenomas (TSA), or adenocarcinomas (colorectal cancer, CRC) in 2,910,174 colonoscopies done 2008-2020.
During the 13-year time period, the rate of SSA showed a significant rise, both in patients younger and older than 55 years. HP and TA both showed a significant decline during the same time period. The trends of CRC in the older age group decreased significantly between 2008 (or its peak in 2012) and 2020. The trends of CRC in the younger age group increased significantly between 2008 and its peak in 2017.
The age-specific time trends of benign and malignant colonic neoplasia are characterized by dissimilar temporal patterns. Such dissimilarity could suggest that besides a set of shared risk factors that affect all types of colonic neoplasia alike, there is yet another set of environmental risk factors that specifically influence malignant transformation.",,,"During the 13-year time period, the rate of SSA showed a significant rise, both in patients younger and older than 55 years.

However, the relationship between PCR and postoperative complications remains an important unsolved problem. The objective of this study was to determine whether PCR was associated with the rate of postoperative complications.
This meta-analysis was implemented following the recommendations from Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. We searched electronic literature by PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. Major outcomes of interest included anastomotic leakage, surgical-site infection, reoperation, and any postoperative complications. Other outcomes comprised postoperative hemorrhage, ileus, and mortality.
Eleven thousand two hundred ninety patients in 9 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis revealed that patients with PCR did not have a higher risk of anastomotic leakage (OR = 1.22, 95% CI 0.92-1.62, p = 0.17), reoperation (OR = 1.13, 95% CI 0.93-1.37, p = 0.22), and any postoperative complications (OR = 1.02, 95% CI 0.91-1.15, p = 0.72) than patients with non-PCR. However, the meta-analysis showed that the PCR group was superior to the non-PCR group in terms of surgical-site infection (9.38% vs. 12.44%OR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.47-0.98; p = 0.04).

As inclusion and exclusion criteria for the studies, only controlled clinical trials (randomized or not) were considered. The risk of bias of each included study was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. Of the 129 potentially eligible studies, only 2 were included, both randomized controlled clinical trials; however, one used platelet-rich plasma and another leukocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin. Overall, both autologous platelet concentrates had no effect on the outcome assessed.

We aimed to assess the specific and combined effects of leisure-time and occupational physical activities on CRC risk among Japanese adults.
Using Cox proportional hazard models, we tested whether walking time, sports activity, body posture during work, and job type-or the combination of these variables-were associated with CRC incidence in a prospective cohort of 26,897 Japanese adults aged 40-79 years.
During a median 17-year follow-up (1990-2009) period, we ascertained 423 incident cases of CRC (267 colon and 156 rectum cancer). Time spent walking suggested a dose-response inverse relationship with CRC risk (p-trend = 0.051). Manual labor was associated with lower CRC risk when compared to office work with HRs (95% CIs) of 0.74 (0.56-0.97) for CRC and 0.68 (0.48-0.96) for colon cancer. Compared to sitting, moving during work tended to be inversely associated with rectal cancer risk, especially after censoring early incident cases within 3 years after baseline; HR (95% CI) = 0.63 (0.40-0.99). Combining walking and job type suggested mutual and synergistic benefits on the risk of colon cancer (p-interaction = 0.03). Compared to office workers walking < 1 h/day, the HR (95% CI) of colon cancer was 0.48 (0.23-0.98), 0.61 (0.42-0.89), and 0.59 (0.41-0.87) in office workers walking ≥ 1 h/day, non-office workers walking < 1 h/day, and non-office workers walking ≥ 1 h/day, respectively.

To date, ≤ 100 genes with somatic alterations have been found to inter-connectively promote neoplastic transformation through specific pathways. The process of colorectal carcinogenesis via genome landscape is reviewed on the basis of an adenoma-to-carcinoma sequence, as shown by serial histological and epidemiological observations.
The relevant literatures from PubMed (1980-2021) have been reviewed for this article.
The major routes of CRC development, chromosomal instability (CIN), microsatellite instability (MSI), and the serrated route either via CIN or MSI, proceed through the respective molecular pathway of colorectal carcinogenesis. Particular aspects of CRC carcinogenesis can also be determined by evaluating familial CRCs (FCRC) and genotype-phenotype correlations. Specific causative gene alterations still leave to be identified in several FCRCs. Otherwise, recently verified FCRC can be particularly notable, for example, EPCAM-associated Lynch syndrome, polymerase proofreading-associated polyposis, RNF43-associated polyposis syndrome or NTHL1 tumour syndrome, and hereditary mixed polyposis syndrome. The oncogenic landscape is described, including representative pathway genes, the three routes of carcinogenesis, familial CRCs, genotype-phenotype correlations, the identification of causative genes, and consensus molecular subtypes (CMS).
Whole genome research using multi-gene panels (MGPs) has facilitated high through-put detection of previously unidentified genes involved in colorectal carcinogenesis.

Particular aspects of CRC carcinogenesis can also be determined by evaluating familial CRCs (FCRC) and genotype-phenotype correlations. Specific causative gene alterations still leave to be identified in several FCRCs. Otherwise, recently verified FCRC can be particularly notable, for example, EPCAM-associated Lynch syndrome, polymerase proofreading-associated polyposis, RNF43-associated polyposis syndrome or NTHL1 tumour syndrome, and hereditary mixed polyposis syndrome. The oncogenic landscape is described, including representative pathway genes, the three routes of carcinogenesis, familial CRCs, genotype-phenotype correlations, the identification of causative genes, and consensus molecular subtypes (CMS).","© 2021.

Medline and Embase searches to identify published clinical trials, cohort studies, reviews, clinical practise guidelines and meta-analyses to design expert opinion-based follow-up schedules.
In four different systematic reviews, we previously identified 1375 men with Leydig, 435 with Sertoli, 239 with granulosa cell lesions and 146 with spermatocytic tumours. Local recurrence after testis-sparing surgery (TSS) was observed in 7%, < 1% and 5% of men with Leydig, Sertoli and granulosa cell tumours: no reports were available regarding recurrence after TSS in men with spermatocytic tumours. Distant recurrence was observed in 6%, 4%, 4% and 7% of the first four tumour types, respectively: metastasis was never reported in granulosa cell tumours of juvenile type. For patients with metastatic disease, complete response after surgical resection was reported in 10%, 18%, 43% and 4%. Complete response after chemotherapy was reported in 5%, 0%, 29% and 4%.

35048194,Dietary fat and fatty acids in relation to risk of colorectal cancer.,"['Colorectal cancer', 'Dietary fat', 'Monounsaturated fatty acids from animal sources', 'Prospective cohort']",European journal of nutrition,"Epidemiologic evidence for specific types and sources of dietary fat and individual fatty acid with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk remains inconclusive. We aimed to comprehensively examine the associations of intakes of specific types (saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and trans) and sources (animal, dairy, and vegetable) of dietary fat and individual fatty acid with CRC risk.
We prospectively followed 65,550 women from the Nurses' Health Study (1986-2014) and 45,684 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2014). Dietary intake was assessed every 4 years using food frequency questionnaires. Self-reported CRC cases were confirmed through medical record review. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) for intakes of dietary fats and fatty acids and CRC risk.
During 2,705,560 person-years of follow-up, 2726 incident CRC cases were confirmed. Intake of monounsaturated fat tended to be positively associated with the risk of CRC (HR comparing extreme quintiles 1.22; 95% CI 1.01, 1.47; p = 0.06 for trend). This positive association was mainly driven by monounsaturated fatty acids from animal sources (MUFA-As) (HR comparing extreme quintiles 1.23; 95% CI 1.02, 1.49; p = 0.02 for trend). The positive association between MUFA-As and CRC was attenuated after adjusting for red and processed meat consumption (HR comparing extreme quintiles 1.17; 95% CI 0.95, 1.44; p = 0.13 for trend). We did not find clear associations between other types and sources of dietary fat or individual fatty acid and CRC risk.
Higher intake of MUFA-As was associated with higher CRC risk. This could be partly explained by confounding due to other components of red and processed meat.",,,"During 2,705,560 person-years of follow-up, 2726 incident CRC cases were confirmed.

35048188,Trends and outcomes of minimally invasive surgery for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).,"['GIST', 'Large tumors', 'Minimally invasive surgery', 'Neoadjuvant']",Surgical endoscopy,"Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is increasingly being utilized for the resection of gastrointestinal cancers. National trends for perioperative and oncologic outcomes of MIS for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are unknown. We hypothesized that with increased use of MIS, the perioperative outcomes and survival for GIST are preserved.
The National Cancer Database (2010-2016) was utilized to assess perioperative and oncologic outcomes for GIST of the stomach and small bowel. Kaplan-Meier method and log rank test were used to compare survival outcomes.
Data from 8923 gastric and 3683 small bowel resections were analyzed. Over the study period, MIS became the prevalent modality for gastrectomies (2010: robotic: 2.4%, laparoscopic: 26.1%, open: 71.5% vs. 2016: robotic: 9.6%, laparoscopic: 48.8%, open: 41.6%; p < 0.001), with a smaller increase in enterectomies (2010: robotic: 1%, laparoscopic: 17.3%, open: 81.6% vs. 2016: robotic: 3.9%, laparoscopic: 27.2%, open: 68.9%; p < 0.001). Age and Charlson comorbidity index were similar among groups. MIS approaches were associated with fewer readmissions and lower 90 day mortality for gastrectomies and similar rates for enterectomies. MIS did not compromise patient survival even in patients who underwent neoadjuvant treatment or harbored tumors ≥ 10 cm.
Minimally invasive surgery is increasingly being utilized for resection of gastric and small bowel GIST, with improved postoperative outcomes. In this retrospective review, overall survival after minimally invasive or open surgery was comparable, even in challenging scenarios of neoadjuvant treatment or large tumors (≥ 10 cm).","Minimally invasive surgery is increasingly being utilized for resection of gastric and small bowel GIST, with improved postoperative outcomes. In this retrospective review, overall survival after minimally invasive or open surgery was comparable, even in challenging scenarios of neoadjuvant treatment or large tumors (≥ 10 cm).",,"Data from 8923 gastric and 3683 small bowel resections were analyzed.

Moreover, they show a great potential in terms of non-invasive, longitudinal monitoring of cancer patients. CTCs have been extensively studied in breast cancer (BC) and were shown to present a significant phenotypic plasticity connected with initiation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Apart from conferring malignant properties, EMT affects CTCs recovery rate, making a significant portion of CTCs from patients' samples undetected. Wider application of methods and markers designed to isolate and identify mesenchymal CTCs is required to expand our knowledge about the clinical impact of mesenchymal CTCs. Therefore, here we provide a comprehensive review of clinical significance of mesenchymal CTCs in BC together with statistical analysis of previously published data, in which we assessed the suitability of a number of methods/markers used for isolation of CTCs with different EMT phenotypes, both in in vitro spike-in tests with BC cell lines, as well as clinical samples. Results of spiked-in cell lines indicate that, in general, methods not based on epithelial enrichment only, capture mesenchymal CTCs much more efficiently that CellSearch",,,,© 2022.

35048182,ZBTB28 inhibits breast cancer by activating IFNAR and dual blocking CD24 and CD47 to enhance macrophages phagocytosis.,"['Breast cancer', 'CD24', 'CD47', 'IFNAR', 'Phagocytosis', 'ZBTB28']",Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in female. Until now, advanced breast cancer is still lack effective treatment strategies and reliable prognostic markers. In the present article, we introduced the physiologic and pathologic functions and regulation mechanisms of ZBTB28, a tumor suppressor gene, in breast cancer. ZBTB28 is frequently silenced in breast cancer due to promoter CpG methylation, and its expression is positively correlated with breast cancer patient survival. The antineoplastic effect of ZBTB28 in breast cancer was elucidated through a series of in vitro and in vivo measurements, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), and growth of xenografts. Furthermore, ZBTB28 can directly regulate IFNAR to activate interferon-stimulated genes and potentiate macrophage activation. Ectopic ZBTB28 expression in breast cancer cells was sufficient to downregulate CD24 and CD47 to promote phagocytosis of macrophages, demonstrating that ZBTB28 was beneficial for the combination treatment of anti-CD24 and anti-CD47. Collectively, our results reveal a mode of action of ZBTB28 as a tumor suppressor gene and suggest that ZBTB28 is an important regulator of macrophage phagocytosis in breast cancer, holding promise for the development of novel therapy strategies for breast cancer patients.",,,,"© 2022.

35048178,Pediatric apps: what are they for? A scoping review.,"['App', 'Pediatrics', 'Review', 'eHealth', 'mHealth']",European journal of pediatrics,"In recent years, there has been a surge in the development of mHealth apps. Nevertheless, there are no scoping reviews that analyze the scientific peer-reviewed articles of these tools. This research systematically reviews the scientific literature published on health apps targeting children in peer-reviewed journals. It aims to answer four questions: what is the primary purpose of these apps; for what medical specialties and main topics were they developed; whom do they target; and how they were analyzed. The study followed PRISMA methodology, and the search process used the Web of Science Core Collection. The selected terms for the search were ""pediatr*"" and ""app."" The initial search resulted in 303 papers which, after applying filters, excluded 187 papers. In the end, 116 articles were deemed appropriate for addressing our research questions and were thoroughly reviewed. The primary purpose of pediatric health apps is to support clinical decision-making, patient education, and patient self-management. The most frequent topics covered are cancer, obesity, and asthma. Hematological oncology and endocrinology are the most frequent medical specialties addressed. The apps mainly target children, their caregivers, or both groups. Most of the apps were analyzed using observational studies, predominantly conducted in the USA, with an average participant sample size of 842. No analyses of development costs were found. These findings can be helpful for the development of future pediatric health apps. What is Known: • Health care has become increasingly digital due to digital health technologies, which have helped to expand the scope of health care. • Digital health technology can be used to improve the health of children. • The increasing availability of smartphones for children and families may enable the use of apps to deliver, promote, and sustain interventions which could lead to long-term improvements in health. What is New: • The most frequent topics covered were cancer, obesity, and asthma. Hematology-oncology and endocrinology were the most frequent medical specialties addressed. • The principal aims of the pediatric health apps were to facilitate clinical decision support, patient education, and patient self-management. • The apps mainly targeted children, their caregivers, or both groups. • Most of them had been analyzed using observational studies.",,,,"© 2021.

35048177,"""Dear hair loss""-illness perceptions of female patients with chemotherapy-induced alopecia.","['Chemotherapy-induced alopecia', 'Common Sense Model', 'Coping', 'Illness perceptions', 'Psychological impact', 'Quality of life']",Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,"Chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA) is one of the most common and distressing side effects of chemotherapy treatment. This study aims to assess the illness perceptions of female patients dealing with CIA, and their associations with demographic and clinical characteristics, coping strategies, and quality of life. The secondary aim was to compare the illness perceptions of patients with CIA with other samples, to help elucidate the specific perceptions of patients with CIA.
Forty female patients at risk of severe hair loss due to chemotherapy treatment were included at the oncological daycare unit of a teaching hospital in the Netherlands. Patients were asked to complete the Brief-Illness Perception Questionnaire (B-IPQ) and the Hair Quality of Life (Hair-QoL) questionnaire.
Illness perceptions indicated that although patients understood their hair loss, they lacked being able to make sense of managing it, negatively impacting patients' lives. Psychological quality of life was significantly correlated with the B-IPQ domains: consequences, degree of concern, and emotional response. Social quality of life was significantly correlated with psychological quality of life. Patients with CIA felt significantly less able to manage their hair loss, compared to patients with breast cancer and psoriatic arthritis.
As patients' beliefs of being able to manage their hair loss are important for adopting and maintaining adequate coping behaviors, additional effort of health care providers in fostering patients' sense of control is indicated, focusing on patients' strengths during and after chemotherapy treatment. In the context of developing interventions for patients with CIA, consequences, concern, and emotional response are the major dimensions that should be taken in account to help patients deal with hair loss.","As patients' beliefs of being able to manage their hair loss are important for adopting and maintaining adequate coping behaviors, additional effort of health care providers in fostering patients' sense of control is indicated, focusing on patients' strengths during and after chemotherapy treatment.

Senescence and the SASP are major factors in aging, cancer, and degenerative diseases, and interfere with the expansion of adult cells in vitro, yet little is known about how to counteract their induction and deleterious effects. Paracrine signals are increasingly recognized as important senescence triggers and understanding their regulation and mode of action may provide novel opportunities to reduce senescence-induced inflammation and improve cell-based therapies. Here, we show that the signalling protein WNT3A counteracts the induction of paracrine senescence in cultured human adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). We find that entry into senescence in a small subpopulation of MSCs triggers a secretome that causes a feed-forward signalling cascade that with increasing speed induces healthy cells into senescence. WNT signals interrupt this cascade by repressing cytokines that mediate this induction of senescence. Inhibition of those mediators by interference with NF-κB or interleukin 6 signalling reduced paracrine senescence in absence of WNT3A and promoted the expansion of MSCs. Our work reveals how WNT signals can antagonize senescence and has relevance not only for expansion of adult cells but can also provide new insights into senescence-associated inflammatory and degenerative diseases.",,,,© 2022.

35048152,Immediate Lipo-Filling as a Novel Technique for Volume Replacement in Oncoplastic Breast Conservative Surgery.,"['Breast cancer', 'Breast reconstruction', 'Lipofilling', 'Oncological safety']",Aesthetic plastic surgery,"We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of immediate lipofilling as a volume replacement technique in breast conservative surgery (BCS) in terms of the volume of fat graft resorption after radiotherapy, patient satisfaction, and oncological safety.
This was a prospective study that included female patients with breast cancer, with small- or medium-sized breasts. The patients underwent BCS followed by lipofilling into the deformed areas away from the tumor site that resulted from direct closure of the tumor cavity. They were followed up for early and late postoperative complications, including recurrence. Volumetric computed tomography was performed before and after radiotherapy to determine percentage fat resorption. Postoperative patient satisfaction was assessed using the Kyungpook National University Hospital Breast Reconstruction Satisfaction Questionnaire.
The study included 54 female patients with a mean age of 47.57 ± 9.26 years. The mean follow-up period was 31.02 ± 4.47 months. Local recurrence was observed in three patients (5.56%). The volume reduction of the injected fat graft ranged from 10.15% to 55.67%, with a mean of 29.27 ± 10.06%. Fifty-two patients (96.30%) reported postoperative satisfaction, and nine of them expressed satisfaction only after a second lipofilling session.
Immediate lipofilling as a volume replacement technique in BCS is a safe and simple technique without major complications. It has a locoregional recurrence rate similar to BCS alone, with an acceptable fat resorption percentage and high postoperative patient satisfaction.

35048135,The application of radiomics in predicting gene mutations in cancer.,"['Gene mutation', 'Oncology', 'Precision medicine', 'Radiological imaging', 'Radiomics']",European radiology,"With the development of genome sequencing, the role of molecular targeted therapy in cancer is becoming increasingly important. However, genetic testing remains expensive, invasive, and time-consuming, and thus unavailable for all patients. Radiogenomics aims to correlate imaging characteristics with gene expression patterns, gene mutations, and other genome-related characteristics. Due to the noninvasive nature of medical imaging, the field of radiogenomics is rapidly developing and may serve as a substitute tool for genetic testing. In this article, we briefly summarise the current role of radiogenomics in predicting gene mutations in brain, lung, colorectal, breast, and kidney tumours.

35048134,Prediction of microvascular invasion in HCC by a scoring model combining Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI and biochemical indicators.,"['Biomarkers', 'Hepatocellular carcinoma', 'Magnetic resonance imaging', 'Neoplasm invasion', 'Statistical model']",European radiology,"This study aimed to establish a reliable diagnostic scoring model for the preoperative prediction of microvascular invasion (MVI) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients based on gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and biochemical indicators.
This retrospective study included 129 patients with HCC at our hospital from 2014 to 2020. Based on the intratumoral and peritumoral features on Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI and biochemical indicators, a scoring model was developed for preoperative prediction of MVI, and examined for diagnostic efficacy according to postoperative pathological results. The scoring model was further externally validated in an independent cohort of 63 HCC patients.
Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify five parameters related to MVI, including maximum tumor diameter, peritumoral low intensity in the hepatobiliary phase, incomplete capsule, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and [alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (U/L) + gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) (U/L)] / lymphocyte count (× 10

In this study, we assessed the performance of 28 scRNA-seq noise reduction procedures in 55 scenarios using simulated and real datasets. The scenarios accounted for multiple biological and technical factors that greatly affect the denoising performance, including relative magnitude of batch effects, the extent of cell population imbalance, the complexity of cell group structures, the proportion and the similarity of nonoverlapping cell populations, dropout rates and variable library sizes. We used multiple quantitative metrics and visualization of low-dimensional cell embeddings to evaluate the performance on batch mixing while preserving the original cell group and gene structures. Based on our results, we specified technical or biological factors affecting the performance of each method and recommended proper methods in different scenarios.

Enzymes achieve this extraordinary feat through their unique kinetic parameters, myriad regulatory strategies, and their sensitivity to their surroundings, including substrate concentration and pH. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) highlights the extraordinary number of ways in which the finely tuned activities of enzymes can be disrupted, contributing to cancer development and progression often due to somatic and/or inherited genetic alterations. Rather than being limited to the domain of enzymologists, kinetic constants such as kcat, Km, and kcat/Km are highly informative parameters that can impact a cancer patient in tangible ways - these parameters can be used to sort tumor driver mutations from passenger mutations, to establish the pathways that cancer cells rely on to drive patients' tumors, to evaluate the selectivity and efficacy of anti-cancer drugs, to identify mechanisms of resistance to treatment, and more. In this review, we will discuss how changes in enzyme activity, primarily through somatic mutation, can lead to altered kinetic parameters, new activities, or changes in conformation and oligomerization. We will also address how changes in the tumor microenvironment can affect enzymatic activity, and briefly describe how enzymology, when combined with additional powerful tools, and can provide us with tremendous insight into the chemical and molecular mechanisms of cancer.",,,,Copyright 2022 The Author(s).,10.1042/BSR20212002,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Adam', 'firstname': 'Mowaffaq Adam Ahmed', 'initials': 'MAA', 'affiliation': 'San Diego State University, San Diego, California, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Sohl', 'firstname': 'Christal D', 'initials': 'CD', 'affiliation': 'San Diego State University, San Diego, California, United States.'}]"

We investigated the effectiveness of fixed-dose combination therapy for the prevention of major cardiovascular events (MCVE) among individuals with and without presumed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (pNASH).
Two thousand four hundred participants over 50 were randomized into the intervention and control groups. Consent was obtained post-randomization. Consenting participants in the intervention group were given a pill containing aspirin, atorvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, and valsartan (polypill). Participants were followed for 5 years. Presumed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis was diagnosed by ultrasonography and elevated liver enzymes. The primary outcome was MCVE. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01245608. Among the originally randomized population, 138 of 1249 in the intervention group (11.0%) and 137 of 1017 controls (13.5%) had MCVE during the 5-year follow-up [unadjusted risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66-1.03]. Of the 1508 participants who consented to additional measurements and treatment, 63 of 787 (8.0%) intervention group participants and 86 of 721 (11.9%) controls had MCVE (adjusted RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.44-0.83). Although the adjusted relative risk of MCVE in participants with pNASH (0.35, 95% CI 0.17-0.74) was under half that for participants without pNASH (0.73, 95% CI 0.49-1.00), the difference did not reach statistical significance. There was no change in liver enzymes in participants taking polypill but among those with pNASH, there was a significant decrease after 60 months of follow-up (intragroup -12.0 IU/L, 95% CI -14.2 to -9.6).
Among patients consenting to receive fixed-dose combination therapy, polypill is safe and effective for the prevention of MCVE, even among participants with fatty liver and increased liver enzymes.
Can a single daily fixed-dose combination pill of aspirin, atorvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, and valsartan (polypill) provide protection against major cardiovascular events (MCVE) in the general population? Does this protection extend to individuals with fatty liver and increased liver enzymes?
We observed no significant decrease in MCVE in participants randomized to the polypill group. However, among participants who consented to receive polypill, there was a significant decrease in MCVE and all-cause mortality regardless of fatty liver or increased liver enzymes.
In people aged >50 years, the polypill appears safe, well tolerated, and might reduce the risk of MCVE. Fatty liver and increased liver enzymes do not affect the safety of the polypill. Liver enzymes may decrease during treatment.","Among patients consenting to receive fixed-dose combination therapy, polypill is safe and effective for the prevention of MCVE, even among participants with fatty liver and increased liver enzymes.",,,"© The Author(s) 2022.

35048092,High efficiency capture of biomarker miRNA15a for noninvasive diagnosis of malignant kidney tumors.,[],Biomaterials science,"To date, there are no preoperative and quantitative dynamics in clinical practice that can reliably differentiate between a benign and malignant renal cell carcinoma (RCC). For monitoring different analytes in body fluids, more than 40 different molecular biomarkers have been identified, however, they are associated with limited clinical sensitivity and/or non-optimal specificity due to their leaky nature. Previous work on RCC demonstrated the miRNA15a to be reliable and novel biomarker with 98.1% specificity and 100% sensitivity. Despite the high potential of miRNA15a biomarker, its clinical application is considerably hampered by the insensitive nature of the detection methods and low concentration of biomarker in samples that is aggravated by the high level of contamination due to other solutes present in body fluids. In this work, a non-invasive quantitative approach is demonstrated to overcome such diagnostics issues through biotin-streptavidin binding and fluorescence active magnetic nanocarriers that ensured prompt isolation, enrichment and purification of the biomarker miRNA15a from urine. The study demonstrates that detectable low levels of these miRNAs through miRNA capturing nanocarriers can potentially function as advanced diagnostic markers for the non-invasive investigation and early detection of renal cancer.",,,,,10.1039/d1bm01737c,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Renner', 'firstname': 'Alexander M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, University of Cologne, Greinstr. 6, 50939 Cologne, Germany. sanjay.mathur@uni-koeln.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Derichsweiler', 'firstname': 'Christina', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, University of Cologne, Greinstr. 6, 50939 Cologne, Germany. sanjay.mathur@uni-koeln.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Ilyas', 'firstname': 'Shaista', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, University of Cologne, Greinstr. 6, 50939 Cologne, Germany. sanjay.mathur@uni-koeln.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Gessner', 'firstname': 'Isabel', 'initials': 'I', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, University of Cologne, Greinstr. 6, 50939 Cologne, Germany. sanjay.mathur@uni-koeln.de.'}, {'lastname': 'Fries', 'firstname': 'Jochen W U', 'initials': 'JWU', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Urology/Pathology, University Hospital of Cologne, Kerpenerstr. 62, 50924 Cologne, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Mathur', 'firstname': 'Sanjay', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, University of Cologne, Greinstr. 6, 50939 Cologne, Germany. sanjay.mathur@uni-koeln.de.'}]"
35048086,Tumor-targeted biomimetic nanoplatform precisely integrates photodynamic therapy and autophagy inhibition for collaborative treatment of oral cancer.,[],Biomaterials science,"Oral cancer is a common malignant tumor in the maxillofacial region. Surgical resection is the preferred treatment, but the severe functional impairment after surgery forces us to look for noninvasive treatments. As a promising noninvasive treatment method, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has received widespread attention in the field of cancer therapy, but the inefficient uptake capacity of tumor cells and the damage repair mechanisms limit the actual therapeutic effect. The establishment of a targeted therapy function and autophagy inhibition strategy is considered to be an important way to further enhance the effect of PDT. Based on this, we developed the biomimetic nanomaterial PCN-CQ@CCM. The metal-organic framework material PCN-224 was used as a carrier to load the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) and it was coated onto the surface with isolated oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell membranes. Owing to the immune evasion and homologous targeting ability of the biomimetic functionalized surface, PCN-CQ@CCM can escape macrophage phagocytosis and homologously adhere to tumor cells, enhancing the retention and uptake of nanomaterials in the tumor microenvironment. After being activated with a 660 nm laser, the generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) triggered the apoptosis pathway, as assessed by mitochondrial damage, and the released CQ further aggravated the ROS lethal pathway by effectively inhibiting the protective autophagic flux. Therefore, PCN-CQ@CCM achieves the precise synergy of PDT and autophagy inhibition through the biomimetic homologous targeting method, and the highly effective tumor suppression effect expands the field of vision for the noninvasive diagnosis and treatment of oral cancer.",,,,,10.1039/d1bm01780b,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Dai', 'firstname': 'Hao', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China. wangyuguang@bjmu.edu.cn.\nDepartment of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yan', 'firstname': 'Han', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China. wangyuguang@bjmu.edu.cn.\nDepartment of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Dong', 'firstname': 'Fan', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China. wangyuguang@bjmu.edu.cn.\nNational Center of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China.\nNational Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Beijing 100081, China.\nCenter of Digital Dentistry, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China.\nNational Engineering Laboratory for Digital and Material Technology of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Zhang', 'firstname': 'Ludan', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China. wangyuguang@bjmu.edu.cn.\nNational Center of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China.\nNational Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Beijing 100081, China.\nCenter of Digital Dentistry, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China.\nNational Engineering Laboratory for Digital and Material Technology of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Du', 'firstname': 'Ning', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Central Laboratory, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Lisha', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Central Laboratory, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Li', 'firstname': 'Ningyu', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China. wangyuguang@bjmu.edu.cn.\nNational Center of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China.\nNational Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Beijing 100081, China.\nCenter of Digital Dentistry, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China.\nNational Engineering Laboratory for Digital and Material Technology of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yu', 'firstname': 'Guohui', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China. wangyuguang@bjmu.edu.cn.\nNational Center of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China.\nNational Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Beijing 100081, China.\nCenter of Digital Dentistry, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China.\nNational Engineering Laboratory for Digital and Material Technology of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Yang', 'firstname': 'Zeyuan', 'initials': 'Z', 'affiliation': 'Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China. wangyuguang@bjmu.edu.cn.\nNational Center of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China.\nNational Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Beijing 100081, China.\nCenter of Digital Dentistry, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China.\nNational Engineering Laboratory for Digital and Material Technology of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Wang', 'firstname': 'Yuguang', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China. wangyuguang@bjmu.edu.cn.\nNational Center of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China.\nNational Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases, Beijing 100081, China.\nCenter of Digital Dentistry, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China.\nNational Engineering Laboratory for Digital and Material Technology of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China.'}, {'lastname': 'Huang', 'firstname': 'Mingwei', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China. wangyuguang@bjmu.edu.cn.\nDepartment of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Peking University School and Hospital of Stomatology, Beijing 100081, China.'}]"

Cancer care introduces a continuum of sequential or concurrent intensive anti-neoplastic medical interventions that are known to be detrimental to a patient's function. Prehabilitation evidence has grown across several areas of oncology care delivery demonstrating that a multi-modal rehabilitative intervention, delivered prior to oncology-direct therapies, leads to better functional outcomes and improves important endpoints associated with surgery and cancer treatment. This commentary article provides a brief history of the emergence of prehabilitation in cancer care delivery, reviews the current evidence base and guidelines for prehabilitation, and offers insights for future implementation of this model as a standard in oncology care. A prehabilitation program is an optimal starting point for most patients undergoing anti-neoplastic therapy as it serves as a gateway to improving functional outcomes throughout the cancer continuum.

35048083,Breaking malignant nuclei as a non-mitotic mechanism of taxol/paclitaxel.,"['Cell cycle', 'Drug mechanism', 'Drug resistance', 'Microtubules', 'Mitosis', 'Nuclear envelope', 'Paclitaxel', 'Taxanes', 'Taxol']",Journal of cancer biology,"Discovered in a large-scale screening of natural plant chemicals, Taxol/paclitaxel and the taxane family of compounds are surprisingly successful anti-cancer drugs, used in treatment of the majority of solid tumors, and especially suitable for metastatic and recurrent cancer. Paclitaxel is often used in combination with platinum agents and is administrated in a dose dense regimen to treat recurrent cancer. The enthusiasm and clinical development were prompted by the discovery that Taxol binds beta-tubulins specifically found within microtubules and stabilizes the filaments, and consequently inhibits mitosis. However, questions on how paclitaxel suppresses cancer persist, as other specific mitotic inhibitors are impressive in pre-clinical studies but fail to achieve significant clinical activity. Thus, additional mechanisms, such as promoting mitotic catastrophe and impacting non-mitotic targets, have been proposed and studied. A good understanding of how paclitaxel, and additional new microtubule stabilizing agents, kill cancer cells will advance the clinical application of these common chemotherapeutic agents. A recent study provides a potential non-mitotic mechanism of paclitaxel action, that paclitaxel-induced rigid microtubules act to break malleable cancer nuclei into multiple micronuclei. Previous studies have established that cancer cells have a less sturdy, more pliable nuclear envelope due to the loss or reduction of lamin A/C proteins. Such changes in nuclear structure provide a selectivity for paclitaxel to break the nuclear membrane and kill cancer cells over non-neoplastic cells that have a sturdier nuclear envelope. The formation of multiple micronuclei appears to be an important aspect of paclitaxel in the killing of cancer cells, either by a mitotic or non-mitotic mechanism. Additionally, by binding to microtubule, paclitaxel is readily sequestered and concentrated within cells. This unique pharmacokinetic property allows the impact of paclitaxel on cells to persist for several days, even though the circulating drug level is much reduced following drug administration/infusion.

Common important risk factors have implications for economic, social, and moral determinants of health. Interdisciplinarity trained oral health professionals are needed to address the excessively high rates of inequities in oral health. The main reason that oral diseases are still a global health problem is related to mainly individual subjective high-risk approaches, which resulting in high costs and low effectiveness. A paradigm shift for a public health approach is needed at population level that integrates different health professionals who deal with NCDs.

The deep machine learning approach has been used to analyze imaging and radiomics and to develop models that have the potential to assist the clinicians to make an informed and guided decision that can assist to improve patient outcomes. Improved prognostication of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) will greatly benefit the clinical management of oral cancer patients. This review examines the recent development in the field of deep learning for OSCC prognostication. The search was carried out using five different databases-PubMed, Scopus, OvidMedline, Web of Science, and Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE). The search was carried time from inception until 15 May 2021. There were 34 studies that have used deep machine learning for the prognostication of OSCC. The majority of these studies used a convolutional neural network (CNN). This review showed that a range of novel imaging modalities such as computed tomography (or enhanced computed tomography) images and spectra data have shown significant applicability to improve OSCC outcomes. The average specificity, sensitivity, area under receiving operating characteristics curve [AUC]), and accuracy for studies that used spectra data were 0.97, 0.99, 0.96, and 96.6%, respectively. Conversely, the corresponding average values for these parameters for computed tomography images were 0.84, 0.81, 0.967, and 81.8%, respectively. Ethical concerns such as privacy and confidentiality, data and model bias, peer disagreement, responsibility gap, patient-clinician relationship, and patient autonomy have limited the widespread adoption of these models in daily clinical practices.

CAF also confer broad resistance to different types of therapy, including chemo/radiotherapy and EGFR inhibitors; consistent with this, CAF-rich OSCC are associated with poor prognosis. In recent years, much CAF research has focused on their immunological role in the tumour microenvironment, showing that CAF shield tumours from immune attack through multiple mechanisms, and particularly on their role in promoting resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors, an exciting development for the treatment of recurrent/metastatic oral cancer, but which fails in most patients. This review summarises our current understanding of CAF subtypes and function in OSCC and discusses the potential for targeting these cells therapeutically.",,,,"Copyright © 2021 Bienkowska, Hanley and Thomas.",10.3389/froh.2021.686337,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Bienkowska', 'firstname': 'Kamila J', 'initials': 'KJ', 'affiliation': 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Hanley', 'firstname': 'Christopher J', 'initials': 'CJ', 'affiliation': 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Thomas', 'firstname': 'Gareth J', 'initials': 'GJ', 'affiliation': 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.\nCancer Research UK and National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Southampton Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre, Southampton, United Kingdom.'}]"
35048028,Oral Cancer Stem Cells: Therapeutic Implications and Challenges.,"['cancer stem cells', 'head and neck', 'self-renewal', 'squamous cell carcinoma', 'targeted therapy', 'tumor relapse']",Frontiers in oral health,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is currently one of the 10 most common malignancies worldwide, characterized by a biologically highly diverse group of tumors with non-specific biomarkers and poor prognosis. The incidence rate of HNSCC varies widely throughout the world, with an evident prevalence in developing countries such as those in Southeast Asia and Southern Africa. Tumor relapse and metastasis following traditional treatment remain major clinical problems in oral cancer management. Current evidence suggests that therapeutic resistance and metastasis of cancer are mainly driven by a unique subpopulation of tumor cells, termed cancer stem cells (CSCs), or cancer-initiating cells (CICs), which are characterized by their capacity for self-renewal, maintenance of stemness and increased tumorigenicity. Thus, more understanding of the molecular mechanisms of CSCs and their behavior may help in developing effective therapeutic interventions that inhibit tumor growth and progression. This review provides an overview of the main signaling cascades in CSCs that drive tumor repropagation and metastasis in oral cancer, with a focus on squamous cell carcinoma. Other oral non-SCC tumors, including melanoma and malignant salivary gland tumors, will also be considered. In addition, this review discusses some of the CSC-targeted therapeutic strategies that have been employed to combat disease progression, and the challenges of targeting CSCs, with the aim of improving the clinical outcomes for patients with oral malignancies. Targeting of CSCs in head and neck cancer (HNC) represents a promising approach to improve disease outcome. Some CSC-targeted therapies have already been proven to be successful in pre-clinical studies and they are now being tested in clinical trials, mainly in combination with conventional treatment regimens. However, some studies revealed that CSCs may not be the only players that control disease relapse and progression of HNC. Further, clinical research studying a combination of therapies targeted against head and neck CSCs may provide significant advances.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Shahoumi.,10.3389/froh.2021.685236,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Shahoumi', 'firstname': 'Linah A', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Oral Biology and Diagnostic Sciences, Dental College of Georgia, Augusta University, Augusta, GA, United States.'}]"
35048023,Targeting Stress-Response Pathways and Therapeutic Resistance in Head and Neck Cancer.,"['chemotherapy', 'head and neck squamous cell carcinoma', 'oxidative stress', 'radiotherapy', 'resistance', 'targeted therapy']",Frontiers in oral health,"Head and neck cancer is the sixth leading cancer worldwide; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) accounts for more than 90% of incident cases. In the US, cases of HNSCC associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) have been growing in proportion amongst a younger demographic with superior outcomes to the same treatments, relative to cases associated with tobacco. Yet failures to improve the long-term prognosis of advanced HNSCC over the last three decades persist in part due to intrinsic and acquired mechanisms of resistance. Deregulation of the pathways to respond to stress, such as apoptosis and autophagy, often contributes to drug resistance and tumor progression. Here we review the stress-response pathways in drug response and resistance in HNSCC to explore strategies to overcome these resistance mechanisms. We focus on the mechanisms of resistance to current standard cares, such as chemotherapy (i.e., cisplatin), radiation, and cetuximab. Then, we discuss the strategies to overcome these resistances, including novel combinations and immunotherapy.",,,,"Copyright © 2021 Bos, Ratti and Harada.",10.3389/froh.2021.676643,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Bos', 'firstname': 'Tasia', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'School of Dentistry, Philips Institute for Oral Health Research, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Ratti', 'firstname': 'J Alex', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'School of Dentistry, Philips Institute for Oral Health Research, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, United States.'}, {'lastname': 'Harada', 'firstname': 'Hisashi', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'School of Dentistry, Philips Institute for Oral Health Research, Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, United States.'}]"

Despite the recent advances in cancer management, the multimodality approach is not effective in eradicating HNSCC. Moreover, the clinical response to the antiangiogenic therapy remains considerably limited in HNSCC patients, suggesting that tumor perfusion can take place through other non-angiogenic pathways. Tumor cell-induced angiogenesis is one of the main hallmarks of cancer. However, at the end of the previous millennium, a new paradigm of tumor cell-associated neovascularization has been reported in human melanoma cells. This new phenomenon, which was named ""vasculogenic mimicry"" or ""vascular mimicry"" (VM), describes the ability of aggressively growing tumor cells to form perfusable, matrix-rich, vessel-like networks in 3-dimensional matrices ",,,,Copyright © 2021 Salem and Salo.,10.3389/froh.2021.666895,2022-01-21,"[{'lastname': 'Salem', 'firstname': 'Abdelhakim', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Diseases, Clinicum, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.\nTranslational Immunology Research Program (TRIMM), Research Program Unit, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.'}, {'lastname': 'Salo', 'firstname': 'Tuula', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Diseases, Clinicum, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.\nTranslational Immunology Research Program (TRIMM), Research Program Unit, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.\nCancer and Translational Medicine Research Unit, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland.\nHelsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.'}]"
