"We devised a simplified nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy that is simpler than commonly used procedures.
We retrospectively examined 16 cases of classical non-nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy (non-nerve-sparing group) and 16 cases of simplified nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy (nerve-sparing group) performed between 2019 and 2020. We examined and compared the duration of surgery, blood loss, perioperative complications, postoperative urinary function (presence or absence of urinary sensation, number of days with residual urine measurement, and frequency and duration of oral sustained release urapidil capsules and self-catheterization), and short-term prognosis between the two groups.
Compared to conventional non-nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy, the duration of surgery for nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy was significantly shorter (407 [339-555] min vs. 212 [180-356] min; p < 0.001), and blood loss was significantly less. Compared to the nerve-sparing group, the non-nerve-sparing group had more cases of oral urapidil use and a higher frequency of clean intermittent catheterization. Clean intermittent catheterization was required in two cases in the nerve-sparing group; however, it was withdrawn at 180 and 240 days. Conversely, clean intermittent catheterization was still required in three cases in the non-nerve-sparing group. There were no statistically significant differences in progression-free survival and overall survival between the two groups.
The simple nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy resulted in shorter duration of surgery and less blood loss as well as in a clear improvement in the postoperative urinary status and short-term prognosis. This technique simplifies nerve-sparing radical hysterectomy, which is commonly thought to be complicated, making it easier to understand.","['oral sustained release urapidil capsules', 'sparing radical hysterectomy resulted', 'retrospectively examined 16 cases', 'oral urapidil use', 'statistically significant differences', 'residual urine measurement', 'sparing radical hysterectomy', 'sparing radical hysterectomy', 'sparing radical hysterectomy', 'sparing radical hysterectomy', 'sparing radical hysterectomy', 'sparing radical hysterectomy', 'clean intermittent catheterization', 'clean intermittent catheterization', 'clean intermittent catheterization', 'postoperative urinary status', 'postoperative urinary function', 'commonly used procedures', 'technique simplifies nerve', 'less blood loss', '16 cases', 'catheterization ),', 'blood loss', 'blood loss', 'urinary sensation', 'sparing group', 'sparing group', 'sparing group', 'sparing group', 'sparing group', 'sparing group', 'significantly less', 'commonly thought', 'two cases', 'three cases', 'two groups', 'two groups', 'term prognosis', 'term prognosis', 'significantly shorter', 'perioperative complications', 'overall survival', 'free survival', 'clear improvement', '001 ),', 'still required', 'min vs', 'higher frequency', '240 days', 'conventional non', 'classical non', 'simplified nerve', 'simplified nerve', 'simple nerve', 'shorter duration', 'examined', 'cases', 'required', 'min', 'frequency', 'days', 'non', 'non', 'non', 'nerve', 'nerve', 'nerve', 'nerve', 'nerve', 'nerve', 'nerve', 'nerve', 'nerve', 'duration', 'duration', 'duration', 'withdrawn', 'well', 'understand', 'surgery', 'surgery', 'surgery', 'simpler', 'short', 'short', 'self', 'progression', 'presence', 'performed', 'p', 'number', 'making', 'however', 'easier', 'devised', 'conversely', 'complicated', 'compared', 'compared', 'compared', 'absence', '555', '407', '356', '339', '212', '2020', '2019', '180', '180', '0']"
"Accelerated-phase (AP) myelofibrosis, currently defined by circulating blasts 10-19%, usually confers very high risk for progression and poor outcome. The outcome of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for AP myelofibrosis has not been evaluated yet. We analyzed the outcome of 349 clinically and genetically annotated patients with primary or secondary myelofibrosis undergoing reduced intensity transplantation, of whom 35 had AP myelofibrosis. In comparison with chronic-phase (CP, <10% blasts), median leukocyte counts were higher, more patients had constitutional symptoms, and RAS mutations were detected more frequently in the AP group. After a median follow-up of 5.9 years, estimated 5-year overall survival was 65% (95% confidence interval, 49-81%) versus 64% (95% confidence interval, 59-69%) for the CP group (P=0.91), and median overall survival was not reached. In terms of relapse-free survival, estimated 5-year outcome for the AP group was 49% (95% confidence interval, 32-67%) versus 55% (95% confidence interval, 50-61%) for the CP group (P=0.65). Estimated 5-year non-relapse mortality was 20% (95% CI, 8-33%) for the AP group versus 30% (95% confidence interval, 24-35%; P=0.25) for the CP group. In terms of relapse, 5-year incidence was 30% (95% confidence interval, 14-46%) for the AP group versus 15% (95% confidence interval, 11-19%) for the CP group (P=0.02). Results were confirmed in multivariable analysis and propensity score matching. Increase in circulating blasts was associated with increased risk for relapse, showing strongest increase in risk for ≥10% blasts. In conclusion, reduced intensity transplantation showed excellent survival but higher relapse for AP myelofibrosis.","['reduced intensity transplantation showed excellent survival', 'secondary myelofibrosis undergoing reduced intensity transplantation', 'blasts ), median leukocyte counts', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '19 %, usually confers', '81 %) versus 64', '67 %) versus 55', 'ap group versus 15', 'ap group versus 30', 'median overall survival', 'propensity score matching', 'year overall survival', 'showing strongest increase', 'genetically annotated patients', 'circulating blasts 10', '35 %; p', '19 %)', 'free survival', '91 ),', 'median follow', 'circulating blasts', 'ap myelofibrosis', 'ap myelofibrosis', 'ap myelofibrosis', 'ap group', 'ap group', '69 %)', '61 %)', '46 %)', '33 %)', 'cp group', 'cp group', 'cp group', 'cp group', 'year non', 'year incidence', '≥ 10', 'ras mutations', 'multivariable analysis', 'evaluated yet', 'currently defined', 'constitutional symptoms', 'confidence interval', 'confidence interval', 'confidence interval', 'confidence interval', 'confidence interval', 'confidence interval', 'confidence interval', '9 years', '349 clinically', '02 ).', 'year outcome', 'increased risk', 'high risk', 'estimated 5', 'estimated 5', 'estimated 5', 'poor outcome', '65 ).', 'relapse mortality', 'higher relapse', 'blasts', 'myelofibrosis', '30', 'ap', 'patients', 'increase', '35', '10', 'cp', 'risk', '5', '5', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'outcome', 'outcome', 'higher', '65', 'relapse', 'relapse', 'relapse', 'terms', 'terms', 'results', 'reached', 'progression', 'primary', 'phase', 'phase', 'frequently', 'detected', 'confirmed', 'conclusion', 'comparison', 'ci', 'chronic', 'associated', 'analyzed', 'accelerated', '95', '95', '95', '95', '95', '95', '95', '95', '8', '59', '50', '49', '49', '32', '25', '24', '20', '14', '11', '0', '0', '0', '0']"
"Laparoscopic/robotic distal gastrectomy (LDG/RDG) as a treatment for early gastric cancer has become increasingly and widely accepted for its minimal invasiveness and proportionate outcomes. Over the years, in addition to the LDG/RDG technique and the lymphadenectomy and gastrectomy procedures, various reconstruction methods have been developed and further improved upon. In particular, the number of minimally invasive intracorporeal anastomosis reconstruction techniques has been increasing.
The medical records of 445 patients with gastric cancer who underwent reconstruction following LDG/RDG via either trapezoidal-shaped gastroduodenostomy (TAPESTRY; n=126) or delta-shaped anastomosis (DSA; n=319) at our hospital between April 2012 and May 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Short-term surgical outcomes, including the operation time, blood loss, length of hospital stay, and complications, were compared between the 2 groups. Anastomosis-related complications, namely leakage, bleeding, stricture, and delayed gastric emptying, were monitored and graded using the Clavien-Dindo classification.
All operations were either performed or supervised by qualified surgeons. Patients' characteristics in the TAPESTRY group and the DSA group were biased in terms of the surgical approach, but they were well-balanced after propensity score matching. Overall anastomosis-related complications (Clavien-Dindo grade II or above) within 30 days after surgery in the TAPESTRY group were comparable with those in the DSA group, either all patients (1.5% vs. 5.0%, P=0.115) or after propensity score-matching analysis (2.1% vs. 6.5%, P=0.134). There were no records of reoperation or mortality during hospitalization in either group.
TAPESTRY was performed safely, with a low rate of anastomosis-related complications. These findings suggest that trapezoidal-shaped gastroduodenostomy could be a feasible option for reconstruction in patients undergoing LDG/RDG.","['minimally invasive intracorporeal anastomosis reconstruction techniques', 'underwent reconstruction following ldg', 'rdg via either trapezoidal', 'various reconstruction methods', 'within 30 days', 'delayed gastric emptying', 'robotic distal gastrectomy', 'dindo grade ii', 'early gastric cancer', 'term surgical outcomes', 'shaped gastroduodenostomy could', '5 %, p', '0 %, p', 'propensity score matching', 'patients undergoing ldg', 'gastric cancer', 'propensity score', 'shaped gastroduodenostomy', 'shaped anastomosis', 'surgical approach', 'proportionate outcomes', 'matching analysis', 'gastrectomy procedures', 'dindo classification', 'overall anastomosis', 'either performed', 'either group', 'widely accepted', 'retrospectively reviewed', 'rdg technique', 'qualified surgeons', 'performed safely', 'operation time', 'namely leakage', 'minimal invasiveness', 'may 2021', 'low rate', 'improved upon', 'graded using', 'findings suggest', 'feasible option', 'blood loss', 'become increasingly', 'april 2012', '134 ).', 'related complications', 'related complications', 'related complications', '445 patients', 'dsa group', 'dsa group', 'tapestry group', 'tapestry group', 'reconstruction', 'medical records', 'hospital stay', '2 groups', 'trapezoidal', 'anastomosis', 'anastomosis', 'ldg', 'ldg', 'either', 'rdg', 'rdg', 'patients', 'patients', 'complications', 'dsa', '5', '5', '0', '0', 'tapestry', 'tapestry', 'records', 'hospital', '2', 'years', 'well', 'vs', 'vs', 'treatment', 'terms', 'surgery', 'supervised', 'stricture', 'short', 'reoperation', 'particular', 'operations', 'number', 'n', 'n', 'mortality', 'monitored', 'lymphadenectomy', 'length', 'laparoscopic', 'increasing', 'including', 'hospitalization', 'developed', 'delta', 'compared', 'comparable', 'clavien', 'clavien', 'characteristics', 'bleeding', 'biased', 'balanced', 'addition', '6', '319', '126', '115', '1', '1']"
"Parkinson disease (PD) is the second leading neurodegenerative disease worldwide. Important advances in monitoring and treatment have been made in recent years. This article reviews literature on utility of smartphone applications in monitoring PD symptoms that may ultimately facilitate improved patient care, and on movement modulation as a potential therapeutic.
Novel mobile phone applications can provide one-time and/or continuous data to monitor PD motor symptoms in person or remotely, that may support precise therapeutic adjustments and management decisions. Apps have also been developed for medication management and treatment.
Smartphone applications provide a wide array of platforms allowing for meaningful short-term and long-term data collection and are also being tested for intervention. However, the variability of the applications and the need to translate complicated sensor data may hinder immediate clinical applicability.

"A better endometrial cancer (EC) prognosis in patients with coexistent adenomyosis has been hypothesized based on a different prevalence of favorable EC histological prognostic factors. However, pooled risk of EC unfavorable histological prognostic factors in patients with adenomyosis has never been calculated.
We aimed to assess the risk of EC unfavorable histological prognostic factors in patients with adenomyosis.
All studies with data about histological prognostic factors of EC in patients with and without adenomyosis were included. Relative risk for each unfavorable histological prognostic factor of EC, such as nonendometrioid histotype, FIGO grade 3, FIGO stage II-IV, lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), and deep myometrial invasion, was calculated in patients with adenomyosis compared to patients without adenomyosis.
Seven studies with 4,439 patients were included in the quantitative analysis. EC patients with adenomyosis showed a pooled RR of 0.77 (p = 0.05) for nonendometrioid histotype, 0.55 (p < 0.00001) for FIGO grade 3, 0.60 (p = 0.005) for FIGO stage II-IV, 0.75 (p = 0.004) for LVSI, and 0.65 (p = 0.001) for deep myometrial invasion.
EC patients with adenomyosis have a significantly decreased risk for unfavorable histological prognostic factors of EC compared to EC patients without adenomyosis.

"Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma are rare neoplasms that fall within the category of neuroendocrine tumors. In the last decade, their diagnostic algorithm has been modified to include the evaluation of molecular pathways, genotype and biochemical phenotype, in order to correctly interpret anatomical and functional imaging results and tailor the best therapeutic choices to patients. More specifically, the identification of germline mutations has led to a three-way cluster classification: pseudo-hypoxic cluster, cluster of kinase receptor signaling and protein translation pathways, and cluster of Wnt-altered pathway. In this context, functional imaging gained a crucial role in the management of these patients in agreement with the ever-growing concept of personalized medicine. In this paper we provide an overview of three specific molecular pathways targeted by positron-emitting tracers to image pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas: catecholamine metabolism, somatostatin receptors and glucose uptake. Finally, we recommend different flow charts for use in the selection of tracers for specific clinical scenarios, based on sporadic/inherited tumor and known/unknown mutation status.","['three specific molecular pathways targeted', 'recommend different flow charts', 'specific clinical scenarios', 'protein translation pathways', 'unknown mutation status', 'kinase receptor signaling', 'functional imaging results', 'functional imaging gained', 'correctly interpret anatomical', 'best therapeutic choices', 'way cluster classification', 'molecular pathways', 'somatostatin receptors', 'rare neoplasms', 'personalized medicine', 'neuroendocrine tumors', 'last decade', 'inherited tumor', 'image pheochromocytomas', 'growing concept', 'glucose uptake', 'germline mutations', 'fall within', 'diagnostic algorithm', 'crucial role', 'catecholamine metabolism', 'biochemical phenotype', 'altered pathway', 'hypoxic cluster', 'emitting tracers', 'three', 'cluster', 'cluster', 'tracers', 'wnt', 'use', 'tailor', 'sporadic', 'specifically', 'selection', 'pseudo', 'provide', 'positron', 'pheochromocytoma', 'patients', 'patients', 'paragangliomas', 'paraganglioma', 'paper', 'overview', 'order', 'modified', 'management', 'led', 'known', 'include', 'identification', 'genotype', 'finally', 'ever', 'evaluation', 'context', 'category', 'based', 'agreement']"
"Admission of metastatic cancer patients to the intensive care unit (ICU) poses medical and ethical challenges in the absence of reliable prognostic tools to guide decision-making.
We retrospectively analyzed the medical charts of 129 consecutive patients with metastatic solid tumors admitted to the ICU between January and September 2014 and identified prognostic factors (PFs) using Cox models.
The mean patient age at ICU admission was 58.9 years (range, 25-81 years; males, 51%). Performance status (PS) was 0-1 and 2-3 in 61% and 39% of the patients, respectively. The most prevalent cancers were lung cancer (20%), sarcoma (17%), and breast cancer (16%). ICU admission was attributable to the cancer itself (53%), cancer treatment toxicity (43%), and comorbidities (37%). The median overall survival (OS) after ICU admission was 2.6 months; 15% of the patients died during the ICU stay. Poor PFs for OS were PS >1 before ICU admission (p = 0.007) and ICU admission for the cancer itself (p < 10-3). After ICU discharge, 58% and 42% of the patients received systemic treatment within 12 months and showed good PS recovery, respectively. Multiple organ failure and a multidisciplinary decision to limit therapeutic efforts were poor PFs for reinitiation of systemic treatment (p = 0.2 and 0.006, respectively), and the latter was also a poor PF for PS recovery (p = 0.004).
In the ICU, the OS of adult patients with solid tumors was similar to that of the noncancer population.

"Pathophysiology of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) is still unclear and disease development is associated with adverse reaction of bisphosphonates and denosumab, and Actinomyces spp. as well. In this study we evaluated the abundance of Actinomyces spp. in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy compared to healthy controls.
Oropharyngeal samples were collected from treatment naive early-stage breast cancer patients, who were scheduled for standard of care therapy (eight samples throughout chemotherapy, one prior to radiotherapy and one after a year of start), as well as from healthy controls at matched timepoints. We quantified Actinomyces spp. in the samples with a highly sensitive and specific qPCR.
Twenty-one patients and 16 healthy subjects were enrolled. 48% of patients suffered from ER-positive/PR-positive or -negative/HER2-negative disease, 38% were HER2-positive and 14% were triple-negative. Comparison of Actinomyces spp. loads in cancer patients and healthy controls did not reveal significant difference. Fluctuations on bacterial quantity was observed in both groups over time. Tumor receptor status or different chemotherapy schemes of patients were not correlated with a particular pattern on abundance of Actinomyces spp.
We suggest that Actinomyces spp. are not the initiative factor in MRONJ development. These bacteria are not altered in abundance during chemotherapy, but they behave opportunistic when there is a bone disruption in the oropharynx in the first place caused by antiresorptive drugs or dental trauma and proliferate in their new niche. Thus, Actinomyces spp. play a latter role in MRONJ development, rather than a primary causative one.","['breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy compared', 'stage breast cancer patients', 'eight samples throughout chemotherapy', 'different chemotherapy schemes', 'tumor receptor status', 'treatment naive early', 'reveal significant difference', 'first place caused', '16 healthy subjects', 'primary causative one', 'quantified actinomyces spp', 'cancer patients', 'patients suffered', 'one patients', 'oropharyngeal samples', 'actinomyces spp', 'actinomyces spp', 'actinomyces spp', 'actinomyces spp', 'actinomyces spp', 'actinomyces spp', 'healthy controls', 'healthy controls', 'healthy controls', 'still unclear', 'start ),', 'specific qpcr', 'related osteonecrosis', 'particular pattern', 'one prior', 'new niche', 'matched timepoints', 'latter role', 'initiative factor', 'highly sensitive', 'disease development', 'dental trauma', 'care therapy', 'bone disruption', 'behave opportunistic', 'bacterial quantity', 'antiresorptive drugs', 'adverse reaction', 'mronj development', 'mronj development', 'chemotherapy', 'negative disease', 'patients', 'samples', 'one', 'mronj', 'negative', 'negative', 'year', 'well', 'well', 'twenty', 'triple', 'time', 'thus', 'suggest', 'study', 'standard', 'scheduled', 'rather', 'radiotherapy', 'proliferate', 'pr', 'positive', 'positive', 'positive', 'play', 'pathophysiology', 'oropharynx', 'observed', 'medication', 'loads', 'jaw', 'her2', 'her2', 'groups', 'fluctuations', 'evaluated', 'er', 'enrolled', 'denosumab', 'correlated', 'comparison', 'collected', 'bisphosphonates', 'bacteria', 'associated', 'altered', 'abundance', 'abundance', 'abundance', '48', '38', '14']"
"In this study, we investigated the possibility of predicting expression levels of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) using radiomic features of intratumoral and peritumoral tumors on computed tomography (CT) images. We retrospectively analyzed 161 patients with non-small cell lung cancer. We extracted radiomics features for intratumoral and peritumoral regions on CT images. The null importance, least absolute shrinkage, and selection operator model were used to select the optimized feature subset to build the prediction models for the PD-L1 expression level. LightGBM with five-fold cross-validation was used to construct the prediction model and evaluate the receiver operating characteristics. The corresponding area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for the training and testing cohorts. The proportion of ambiguously clustered pairs was calculated based on consensus clustering to evaluate the validity of the selected features. In addition, Radscore was calculated for the training and test cohorts. For expression level of PD-L1 above 1%, prediction models that included radiomic features from the intratumoral region and a combination of radiomic features from intratumoral and peritumoral regions yielded an AUC of 0.83 and 0.87 and 0.64 and 0.74 in the training and test cohorts, respectively. In contrast, the models above 50% prediction yielded an AUC of 0.80, 0.97, and 0.74, 0.83, respectively. The selected features were divided into two subgroups based on PD-L1 expression levels ≥ 50% or ≥ 1%. Radscore was statistically higher for subgroup one than subgroup two when radiomic features for intratumoral and peritumoral regions were combined. We constructed a predictive model for PD-L1 expression level using CT images. The model using a combination of intratumoral and peritumoral radiomic features had a higher accuracy than the model with only intratumoral radiomic features.","['l1 expression level using ct images', 'l1 expression levels ≥ 50', 'small cell lung cancer', 'retrospectively analyzed 161 patients', '1 %, prediction models', 'predicting expression levels', 'l1 expression level', '≥ 1 %.', 'receiver operating characteristics', 'optimized feature subset', 'least absolute shrinkage', 'ambiguously clustered pairs', 'using radiomic features', 'extracted radiomics features', 'included radiomic features', 'two subgroups based', 'selection operator model', 'peritumoral radiomic features', 'expression level', 'peritumoral regions yielded', 'intratumoral radiomic features', 'ct images', 'model using', 'radiomic features', 'radiomic features', 'prediction yielded', 'ligand 1', 'prediction models', 'peritumoral regions', 'peritumoral regions', 'selected features', 'selected features', 'subgroup two', 'prediction model', 'peritumoral tumors', 'testing cohorts', 'test cohorts', 'test cohorts', 'subgroup one', 'statistically higher', 'programmed death', 'predictive model', 'null importance', 'higher accuracy', 'fold cross', 'corresponding area', 'consensus clustering', 'computed tomography', 'calculated based', 'intratumoral region', 'l1', 'l1', 'images', 'ct', '50', 'models', 'model', 'intratumoral', 'intratumoral', 'intratumoral', 'intratumoral', 'intratumoral', 'calculated', 'calculated', 'validity', 'validation', 'used', 'used', 'training', 'training', 'training', 'study', 'select', 'respectively', 'respectively', 'radscore', 'radscore', 'proportion', 'possibility', 'pd', 'pd', 'pd', 'pd', 'pd', 'non', 'lightgbm', 'investigated', 'five', 'evaluate', 'evaluate', 'divided', 'curve', 'contrast', 'constructed', 'construct', 'combined', 'combination', 'combination', 'build', 'auc', 'auc', 'auc', 'addition', '97', '87', '83', '83', '80', '74', '74', '64', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']"

"Extended interval dosing (EID; average dosing interval approximately every 6 weeks) of natalizumab is associated with significantly lower risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy than standard interval dosing (SID; every 4 weeks) in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). Real-world studies, though limited, suggest that natalizumab effectiveness is generally maintained in patients who switch to EID after initiation of stable treatment with SID. MS PATHS (Multiple Sclerosis Partners Advancing Technology and Health Solutions) is a collaborative, multicenter learning health system that generates real-world clinical and MRI data using highly standardized acquisition protocols. We compared MRI outcomes in MS PATHS patients treated with natalizumab EID versus SID. We also compared MRI outcomes in patients treated with natalizumab (EID and/or SID) versus injectable MS platform therapy.
Natalizumab infusion data from the TOUCH Prescribing Program database and MS PATHS MRI assessment data from seven US sites as of July 23, 2020, were used to identify patients with relapsing-remitting MS who had received natalizumab EID or SID in the interval between two MRI scans (an MRI segment). Patients who received injectable platform MS therapy between two MRI scans were also identified. MRI data were used to determine the incidence rate and odds of developing new or enlarging T2 lesions, annualized percentage change in T2 lesion volume (T2LV), and annualized percentage change in brain parenchymal fraction (BPF). MRI outcomes were compared for 1) natalizumab EID treatment versus natalizumab SID treatment, 2) natalizumab treatment (EID + SID) versus platform therapy, and 3) natalizumab EID versus platform therapy. Propensity score-based weighting or matching were used to balance covariates at the start of MRI segments for all comparisons.
The MRI outcomes observed with natalizumab EID treatment did not differ significantly from those observed with natalizumab SID treatment. The odds ratio for any new or enlarging T2 lesion was 1.07 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.93, 1.24; p = 0.355), and the rate ratio (95% CI) for new or enlarging T2 lesions was 1.62 (0.93, 2.82; p = 0.090). Differences (95% CI) between EID and SID patients in mean annualized percentage change in T2LV and BPF were 1.56% (-3.77%, 6.90%; p = 0.566) and -0.11% (-0.25%, -0.10%; p = 0.096), respectively. Conversely, when MRI outcomes in natalizumab and platform therapy patients were compared, there were significant differences favoring natalizumab in all assessments: the odds of any new or enlarging T2 lesion (odds ratio: 0.69 [95% CI: 0.64, 0.75]; p<0.001), the incidence rate of new or enlarging T2 lesions (rate ratio: 0.47 [95% CI: 0.37, 0.61]; p<0.001), annualized percentage change (decrease) in T2LV (difference: -3.68% [95% CI: -7.06%, -0.30%]; p = 0.033), and annualized percentage change (increase) in BPF (difference: 0.22% [95% CI: 0.16%, 0.29%]; p<0.001).

"There is a well-recognized association between cancer and myositis, so cancer screening at diagnosis is recommended. We aim to report the results of our cancer screening strategy and to ascertain the reliability of using PET/CT to identify cancer-associated myositis (CAM) in a large cohort of patients with myositis from a single center over 10 years.
This retrospective observational study included all patients diagnosed with any type of myositis except for inclusion body myositis. Cancer screening strategy was individualized according to clinical and serological data, including PET/CT as the main test to detect occult cancer (OC). Procedures derived from a positive PET/CT were registered. Qualitative data expressed as percentages, and quantitative data as the median with the interquartile range were analyzed. A ROC curve was used to estimate the reliability of PET/CT for CAM diagnosis.
Seventy-seven out of 131 patients underwent a PET/CT for OC screening. The performance of the PET/CT in patients with myositis at disease onset yielded an area under the curve ROC of 0.87 (0.73-0.97) for CAM diagnosis. Invasive procedures in 7 (9%) patients without a final diagnosis of cancer did not cause derived complications. Patients not evaluated for OC did not develop cancer after a median follow-up of 3.3 years (1.7-6.7).
Cancer screening strategy should be individualized. PET/CT at myositis onset seems to be an efficient approach to rule out CAM.

"DNA repair vulnerabilities are present in a significant proportion of cancers. Specifically, germline alterations in DNA repair not only increase cancer risk but are associated with treatment response and clinical outcomes. The therapeutic landscape of cancer has rapidly evolved with the FDA approval of therapies that specifically target DNA repair vulnerabilities. The clinical success of synthetic lethality between BRCA deficiency and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition has been truly revolutionary. Defective mismatch repair has been validated as a predictor of response to immune checkpoint blockade associated with durable responses and long-term benefit in many cancer patients. Advances in next generation sequencing technologies and their decreasing cost have supported increased genetic profiling of tumors coupled with germline testing of cancer risk genes in patients. The clinical adoption of panel testing for germline assessment in high-risk individuals has generated a plethora of genetic data, particularly on DNA repair genes. Here, we highlight the therapeutic relevance of germline aberrations in DNA repair to identify patients eligible for precision treatments such as PARP inhibitors (PARPis), immune checkpoint blockade, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and combined treatment. We also discuss emerging mechanisms that regulate DNA repair.","['parpis ), immune checkpoint blockade', 'specifically target dna repair vulnerabilities', 'next generation sequencing technologies', 'immune checkpoint blockade associated', 'also discuss emerging mechanisms', 'supported increased genetic profiling', 'dna repair vulnerabilities', 'regulate dna repair', 'dna repair genes', 'defective mismatch repair', 'identify patients eligible', 'increase cancer risk', 'cancer risk genes', 'many cancer patients', 'dna repair', 'dna repair', 'genetic data', 'risk individuals', 'tumors coupled', 'truly revolutionary', 'therapeutic relevance', 'therapeutic landscape', 'term benefit', 'synthetic lethality', 'significant proportion', 'rapidly evolved', 'radiation therapy', 'precision treatments', 'panel testing', 'germline testing', 'germline assessment', 'germline alterations', 'germline aberrations', 'fda approval', 'durable responses', 'decreasing cost', 'combined treatment', 'clinical success', 'clinical outcomes', 'clinical adoption', 'brca deficiency', 'treatment response', 'parp inhibitors', 'specifically', 'cancer', 'associated', 'patients', 'response', 'parp', 'validated', 'therapies', 'ribose', 'present', 'predictor', 'polymerase', 'poly', 'plethora', 'particularly', 'long', 'inhibition', 'highlight', 'high', 'generated', 'chemotherapy', 'cancers', 'advances', 'adp']"
"Inadequate follow-up of suspicious lung nodules can result in diagnostic delays and potential progression to advanced lung cancer. In 2015, a multidisciplinary lung nodule management program, Nodule Net, was implemented to increase the timely follow-up rate. In this study, we sought to evaluate the effectiveness of the program.
2398 chest CT reports were reviewed for the presence of a lung nodule. Baseline demographics, nodule characteristics, and follow-up recommendations were collected. For reports that did not include structured recommendations, Fleischner Society guidelines were applied if appropriate. The rate of follow-up imaging was recorded and compared with historical rates.
Lung nodules were reported on 1367 (57%) of scans. Of the 632 participants with recommendations for follow-up, the Nodule Net nurse navigator was notified on 523 (83%). Of these, 408 (78%) completed follow-up, compared to 57/109 (52%) in those who were not reported to Nodule Net tracking system (risk ratio: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.24-1.79, p-value < 0.05). Out of these 408, nodule net outreach was required to prompt the follow-up in 116 (28%). Of these, a lung malignancy was diagnosed in 4 (4%).
Management of lung nodules is a complex process. Implementation of a lung nodule tracking program led to a significant increase in the completion of recommended follow-up imaging compared with usual care. Developing a comprehensive lung nodule program using an automated software system rather than manual processes to refer and track incidental findings may further reduce barriers to completion of follow-up.","['comprehensive lung nodule program using', 'lung nodule tracking program led', 'multidisciplinary lung nodule management program', 'track incidental findings may', 'automated software system rather', 'nodule net tracking system', 'nodule net nurse navigator', '2398 chest ct reports', '78 %) completed follow', 'nodule net outreach', 'advanced lung cancer', 'fleischner society guidelines', 'suspicious lung nodules', 'include structured recommendations', 'nodule net', 'lung nodule', 'nodule characteristics', 'lung nodules', 'lung nodules', 'lung malignancy', '52 %)', '57 %)', 'usual care', 'risk ratio', 'reduce barriers', 'program', 'potential progression', 'manual processes', 'historical rates', 'diagnostic delays', 'complex process', 'baseline demographics', '83 %).', '632 participants', '28 %).', '05 ).', 'timely follow', 'recommended follow', 'inadequate follow', 'significant increase', '4 %).', 'management', 'imaging compared', 'reports', 'recommendations', 'recommendations', 'follow', 'follow', 'follow', 'follow', 'follow', 'increase', 'imaging', '57', '4', 'compared', 'compared', 'value', 'study', 'sought', 'scans', 'reviewed', 'result', 'required', 'reported', 'reported', 'refer', 'recorded', 'rate', 'rate', 'prompt', 'presence', 'p', 'notified', 'implemented', 'implementation', 'evaluate', 'effectiveness', 'diagnosed', 'developing', 'completion', 'completion', 'collected', 'ci', 'appropriate', 'applied', '95', '79', '523', '49', '408', '408', '24', '2015', '1367', '116', '109', '1', '1', '1', '0']"
"Plants are a rich source for bioactive compounds. However, plant extracts can harbor a mixture of bioactive molecules that promote divergent phenotypes and potentially have confounding effects in bioassays. Even with further purification and identification, target deconvolution can be challenging. Corynoline and acetylcorynoline, are phytochemicals that were previously isolated through a screen for compounds able to induce mitotic arrest and polyploidy in oncogene expressing retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Here, we shed light on the mechanism by which these phytochemicals can attack human cancer cells. Mitotic arrest was coincident to the induction of centrosome amplification and declustering, causing multi-polar spindle formation. Corynoline was demonstrated to have true centrosome declustering activity in a model where A549 cells were chemically induced to have more than a regular complement of centrosomes. Corynoline could inhibit the centrosome clustering required for pseudo-bipolar spindle formation in these cells. The activity of AURKB, but not AURKA or polo-like kinase 4, was diminished by corynoline. It only partially inhibited AURKB, so it may be a partial antagonist or corynoline may work upstream on an unknown regulator of AURKB activity or localization. Nonetheless, corynoline and acetylcorynoline inhibited the viability of a variety of human cancer derived cell lines. These phytochemicals could serve as prototypes for a next-generation analog with improved potency, selectivity or in vivo bioavailability. Such an analog could be useful as a non-toxic component of combination therapies where inhibiting the chromosomal passenger protein complex is desired.","['oncogene expressing retinal pigment epithelial', 'human cancer derived cell lines', 'chromosomal passenger protein complex', 'attack human cancer cells', 'corynoline may work upstream', 'true centrosome declustering activity', 'promote divergent phenotypes', 'polar spindle formation', 'like kinase 4', 'centrosome clustering required', 'bipolar spindle formation', 'induce mitotic arrest', 'partially inhibited aurkb', 'corynoline could inhibit', 'phytochemicals could serve', 'mitotic arrest', 'centrosome amplification', 'analog could', 'aurkb activity', 'vivo bioavailability', 'unknown regulator', 'toxic component', 'target deconvolution', 'shed light', 'rich source', 'regular complement', 'previously isolated', 'plant extracts', 'partial antagonist', 'improved potency', 'generation analog', 'confounding effects', 'compounds able', 'combination therapies', 'chemically induced', 'causing multi', 'bioactive molecules', 'bioactive compounds', 'acetylcorynoline inhibited', 'a549 cells', 'may', 'declustering', 'activity', 'cells', 'cells', 'aurkb', 'corynoline', 'corynoline', 'corynoline', 'corynoline', 'phytochemicals', 'phytochemicals', 'acetylcorynoline', 'viability', 'variety', 'useful', 'selectivity', 'screen', 'rpe', 'purification', 'pseudo', 'prototypes', 'potentially', 'polyploidy', 'polo', 'plants', 'nonetheless', 'non', 'next', 'model', 'mixture', 'mechanism', 'localization', 'inhibiting', 'induction', 'identification', 'however', 'harbor', 'even', 'diminished', 'desired', 'demonstrated', 'coincident', 'challenging', 'centrosomes', 'bioassays', 'aurka']"
"Most patients affected with colorectal cancers (CRC) are treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy but its efficacy is often hampered by resistance mechanisms linked to tumor heterogeneity. A better understanding of the molecular determinants involved in chemoresistance is critical for precision medicine and therapeutic progress. Caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2) is a master regulator of intestinal identity and acts as tumor suppressor in the colon. Here, using a translational approach, we examined the role of CDX2 in CRC chemoresistance. Unexpectedly, we discovered that the prognosis value of CDX2 for disease-free survival of patients affected with CRC is lost upon chemotherapy and that CDX2 expression enhances resistance of colon cancer cells towards 5-FU. At the molecular level, we found that CDX2 expression correlates with higher levels of genes regulating the bioavailability of 5-FU through efflux (ABCC11) and catabolism (DPYD) in patients affected with CRC and CRC cell lines. We further showed that CDX2 directly regulates the expression of ABCC11 and that the inhibition of ABCC11 improves 5-FU-sensitivity of CDX2-expressing colon cancer cells. Thus, this study illustrates how biological functions are hijacked in CRC cells and reveals the therapeutic interest of CDX2/ABCC11/DPYD to improve systemic chemotherapy in CRC.","['colon cancer cells towards 5', 'caudal type homeobox 2', 'expressing colon cancer cells', 'fu )- based chemotherapy', 'cdx2 expression enhances resistance', 'resistance mechanisms linked', 'lost upon chemotherapy', 'improve systemic chemotherapy', 'molecular determinants involved', 'cdx2 directly regulates', 'crc cell lines', 'cdx2 expression correlates', 'abcc11 improves 5', 'crc cells', 'molecular level', 'tumor suppressor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'translational approach', 'therapeutic progress', 'therapeutic interest', 'study illustrates', 'prognosis value', 'precision medicine', 'patients affected', 'patients affected', 'patients affected', 'often hampered', 'master regulator', 'intestinal identity', 'higher levels', 'genes regulating', 'free survival', 'colorectal cancers', 'biological functions', 'better understanding', 'colon', 'crc chemoresistance', 'expression', '5', '5', '5', 'cdx2', 'cdx2', 'cdx2', 'cdx2', 'cdx2', 'fu', 'fu', 'fu', 'crc', 'crc', 'crc', 'crc', 'chemoresistance', 'abcc11', 'abcc11', 'abcc11', 'using', 'unexpectedly', 'treated', 'thus', 'showed', 'sensitivity', 'role', 'reveals', 'inhibition', 'hijacked', 'found', 'fluorouracil', 'examined', 'efflux', 'efficacy', 'dpyd', 'dpyd', 'disease', 'discovered', 'critical', 'catabolism', 'bioavailability', 'acts']"
"To investigate the impact of harmonization on the performance of CT, PET, and fused PET/CT radiomic features toward the prediction of mutations status, for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS) genes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients.
Radiomic features were extracted from tumors delineated on CT, PET, and wavelet fused PET/CT images obtained from 136 histologically proven NSCLC patients. Univariate and multivariate predictive models were developed using radiomic features before and after ComBat harmonization to predict EGFR and KRAS mutation statuses. Multivariate models were built using minimum redundancy maximum relevance feature selection and random forest classifier. We utilized 70/30% splitting patient datasets for training/testing, respectively, and repeated the procedure 10 times. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were used to assess model performance. The performance of the models (univariate and multivariate), before and after ComBat harmonization was compared using statistical analyses.
While the performance of most features in univariate modeling was significantly improved for EGFR prediction, most features did not show any significant difference in performance after harmonization in KRAS prediction. Average AUCs of all multivariate predictive models for both EGFR and KRAS were significantly improved (q-value < 0.05) following ComBat harmonization. The mean ranges of AUCs increased following harmonization from 0.87-0.90 to 0.92-0.94 for EGFR, and from 0.85-0.90 to 0.91-0.94 for KRAS. The highest performance was achieved by harmonized F_R0.66_W0.75 model with AUC of 0.94, and 0.93 for EGFR and KRAS, respectively.
Our results demonstrated that regarding univariate modelling, while ComBat harmonization had generally a better impact on features for EGFR compared to KRAS status prediction, its effect is feature-dependent. Hence, no systematic effect was observed. Regarding the multivariate models, ComBat harmonization significantly improved the performance of all radiomics models toward more successful prediction of EGFR and KRAS mutation statuses in lung cancer patients. Thus, by eliminating the batch effect in multi-centric radiomic feature sets, harmonization is a promising tool for developing robust and reproducible radiomics using vast and variant datasets.","['built using minimum redundancy maximum relevance feature selection', 'kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene', '136 histologically proven nsclc patients', 'reproducible radiomics using vast', 'receiver operator characteristic curve', 'epidermal growth factor receptor', 'compared using statistical analyses', 'centric radiomic feature sets', 'small cell lung cancer', 'developed using radiomic features', 'aucs increased following harmonization', 'ct radiomic features toward', 'combat harmonization significantly improved', 'lung cancer patients', 'radiomics models toward', 'random forest classifier', 'procedure 10 times', 'splitting patient datasets', 'following combat harmonization', 'ct images obtained', 'kras mutation statuses', 'kras mutation statuses', 'multivariate predictive models', 'multivariate predictive models', 'auc ), accuracy', 'wavelet fused pet', 'assess model performance', 'regarding univariate modelling', 'kras status prediction', 'radiomic features', 'significantly improved', 'significantly improved', 'average aucs', 'multivariate ),', 'combat harmonization', 'combat harmonization', 'combat harmonization', 'multivariate models', 'multivariate models', 'variant datasets', 'mutations status', '75 model', 'egfr compared', 'feature', 'fused pet', 'utilized 70', 'tumors delineated', 'successful prediction', 'significant difference', 'results demonstrated', 'promising tool', 'mean ranges', 'harmonized f_r0', 'developing robust', 'kras prediction', 'univariate modeling', 'systematic effect', 'batch effect', 'better impact', 'highest performance', 'predict egfr', 'egfr prediction', 'patients', 'nsclc', 'models', 'ct', 'ct', 'harmonization', 'harmonization', 'harmonization', 'features', 'features', 'features', 'regarding', 'prediction', 'auc', 'kras', 'kras', 'kras', 'kras', 'univariate', 'univariate', 'pet', 'pet', 'effect', 'impact', 'performance', 'performance', 'performance', 'performance', 'performance', 'egfr', 'egfr', 'egfr', 'egfr', 'egfr', 'value', 'used', 'training', 'thus', 'testing', 'specificity', 'show', 'sensitivity', 'respectively', 'respectively', 'repeated', 'q', 'observed', 'non', 'multi', 'investigate', 'hence', 'genes', 'generally', 'extracted', 'eliminating', 'dependent', 'area', 'achieved', '94', '94', '94', '93', '92', '91', '90', '90', '87', '85', '66_w0', '30', '05', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']"
"Proteins secreted by cells play significant roles in mediating many physiological, developmental, and pathological processes due to their functions in intra/intercellular communication and signaling. Conventional end-point methods are insufficient for understanding the temporal response in cell secretion process, which is often highly dynamic. Furthermore, cellular heterogeneity makes it essential to analyze secretory proteins from single cells. To uncover individual cellular activities and the underlying kinetics, new technologies are needed for real-time analysis of the secretomes of many cells at single-cell resolution. This study reports a high-throughput biosensing microarray platform, which is capable of label-free and real-time secretome monitoring from a large number of living single cells using a biochip integrating ultrasensitive nanoplasmonic substrate and microwell compartments having volumes of ∼0.4 nL. Precise synchronization of image acquisition and microscope stage movement of the developed optical platform enables spectroscopic analysis with high temporal and spectral resolution. In addition, our system allows simultaneous optical imaging of cells to track morphology changes for a comprehensive understanding of cellular behavior. We demonstrated the platform performance by detecting interleukin-2 secretion from hundreds of single lymphoma cells in real-time over many hours. Significantly, the analysis of the secretion kinetics allows us to study cellular response to the stimulations in a statistical way.

"Thrombosis is the main complication in myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). A JAK2V617F mutation has been shown to be a risk factor for thrombosis. The implication of other risk factors alongside a mutation allele burden needs to be clarified (Trifa et al., 2018; Borowczyk et al., 2015).
Our aim was to investigate the role of the JAK2 mutation allele burden in the risk of cardiovascular events (CVE) and/or venous thrombosis (VTE) in a cohort of patients with confirmed MPN, as well as in patients without confirmed MPN.
We restrospectively included all consecutive patients who were positive for JAK2V617F seen by our unit between December 2008 and September 2016. Inclusion criteria were a positive test for the JAK2V617F mutation, with at least 1% allele burden, with or without confirmed MPN.
We included 239 patients of median age 71 years [60-81], followed-up for a median of 82.8 months [41.08-146.88]. For JAK2V617F positive patients having an allele burden superior to 50% the cumulative incidence of VTE was significantly higher than for those with an allele burden inferior to 50% (HR 3.11 95% CI [1.10-8.76] p = 0.031). The cumulative incidence of VTE was also higher in patients with obesity (HR 4.58 95% CI [1.33-15.8] p = 0.016). There was no significant association between a JAK2V617F allele burden and arterial thrombosis (manifesting as CVE).

On behalf of the ESMO Practicing Oncologists Working Group, 11 potentially practice-changing reports were selected and screened for three main questions: (i) Did the investigators provide sufficient details with regard to Patients and Methods to make the results comprehensible? (ii) Were there any reasons to consider bias? (iii) To which extent did the results presented translate to clinical benefit?
In 2 out of 11 trials, the study design presented differed considerably from the study design described at ClinicalTrials.gov. Allocation concealment was not carried out in 6 out of 11 trials. In none of the trials reporting progression-free survival was informative censoring considered an issue. In none of the trials reporting overall survival was desirable crossover considered an issue. Defined trial outcome measures depicted at ClinicalTrials.gov, which could boost or weaken the ESMO-Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale score, were often lacking in the presentation. Study success was claimed in a heterogeneous manner, which was often not clearly linked to overall clinical benefit.
ESMO conference presentations can inform the scientific community and catalyze further research but cannot replace the full papers in peer-reviewed journals, which are needed to estimate the thoroughness of the results, the overall impact on clinical benefit and the consequences for future treatment guidelines.","['defined trial outcome measures depicted', 'esmo practicing oncologists working group', 'randomized phase iii trial reports', 'study design presented differed considerably', 'investigators provide sufficient details', 'clinical benefit scale score', 'trials reporting overall survival', 'study design described', 'trials reporting progression', 'three main questions', 'short time available', 'less time remaining', 'informative censoring considered', 'future treatment guidelines', 'desirable crossover considered', 'results presented translate', '2021 conference provided', 'overall clinical benefit', '11 potentially practice', 'esmo conference presentations', 'clinical benefit', 'clinical benefit', 'changing reports', 'conference presentations', '11 trials', '11 trials', 'overall impact', 'free survival', 'study success', 'study methodology', 'study background', 'practice changing', 'scientific community', 'reviewed journals', 'medical oncology', 'high number', 'heterogeneous manner', 'greatest priority', 'full papers', 'european society', 'could boost', 'consider bias', 'conclusions tend', 'clearly linked', 'cannot replace', 'allocation concealment', 'results comprehensible', 'often lacking', 'iii', 'esmo', 'esmo', 'results', 'results', 'often', 'weaken', 'thoroughness', 'selected', 'screened', 'research', 'regard', 'reasons', 'presentation', 'peer', 'patients', 'none', 'none', 'needed', 'methods', 'many', 'make', 'magnitude', 'issue', 'issue', 'inform', 'ii', 'gov', 'gov', 'given', 'extent', 'estimate', 'consequences', 'clinicaltrials', 'clinicaltrials', 'claimed', 'claimed', 'catalyze', 'carried', 'behalf', '6', '2']"
"The primary objective was to assess whether presentation severity at the emergency department (ED) can determine treatment and health outcomes among patients with oncological emergencies.
We conducted a three-year retrospective analysis of accessible records of adult cancer patients admitted with oncological emergencies.
Patients with subtle presentations had longer wait times than patients with severe presentations in all ED timeliness indicators. On average, subtle presentations were significantly associated with 47.5 min increase in time to be seen, 33 min increase in time to be treated, 42 min increase in time to decide on admission and prolonged ED stay by 24 min (p < 0.05). Subtle presentations were also significantly associated with a four-fold increase in intensive care unit admissions and a three-fold increase in mortality odds.
The severity of the clinical presentations significantly predicted oncological emergencies' treatment and health outcomes. This research raises the importance of emergency triage decision accuracy. Triage health workers should have a solid knowledge base regarding oncological emergencies to improve patients' early recognition and prioritization. Oncological emergency presentations can be subtle, rendering patients vulnerable extensive delay and inferior outcomes. Therefore, triage nurses should be educated and trained on the multiple available severity scales sensitive to identifying the real urgency. Also, protocols and care pathways should be in place to enable immediate fast-tracking of patients and the provision of timely treatment.","['solid knowledge base regarding oncological emergencies', 'clinical presentations significantly predicted oncological emergencies', 'multiple available severity scales sensitive', 'rendering patients vulnerable extensive delay', 'assess whether presentation severity', 'intensive care unit admissions', 'adult cancer patients admitted', 'emergency triage decision accuracy', 'health outcomes among patients', 'oncological emergency presentations', 'year retrospective analysis', 'triage health workers', 'longer wait times', 'enable immediate fast', '5 min increase', '42 min increase', '33 min increase', 'prolonged ed stay', 'ed timeliness indicators', 'also significantly associated', 'oncological emergencies', 'oncological emergencies', 'significantly associated', 'health outcomes', 'triage nurses', 'emergency department', 'care pathways', 'severe presentations', '24 min', 'inferior outcomes', 'fold increase', 'fold increase', 'subtle presentations', 'subtle presentations', 'subtle presentations', 'improve patients', 'research raises', 'real urgency', 'primary objective', 'mortality odds', 'early recognition', 'accessible records', '05 ).', 'timely treatment', 'determine treatment', 'severity', 'patients', 'patients', 'patients', 'ed', 'also', 'subtle', 'treatment', 'treated', 'trained', 'tracking', 'time', 'time', 'time', 'three', 'three', 'therefore', 'seen', 'provision', 'protocols', 'prioritization', 'place', 'p', 'importance', 'identifying', 'four', 'educated', 'decide', 'conducted', 'average', 'admission', '47', '0']"
"A cancer-inhibiting role of mesenchyme homeobox 2 (MEOX2) has been observed in several malignancies. However, the association between MEOX2 and breast carcinoma has not been addressed. This research focused on investigating the possible relevance of MEOX2 in breast carcinoma. Initial expression analysis by TCGA data uncovered low levels of MEOX2 in breast carcinoma. We then confirmed that MEOX2 was poorly expressed in clinical tumor specimens of breast carcinoma by real-time quantitative PCR and immunoblotting assays. Moreover, low levels of MEOX2 in breast carcinoma patients were found to be correlated with reduced overall survival. A series of cellular function assays showed that the forced expression of MEOX2 had anticancer effects, including the inhibition of cell proliferation, the induction of G0-G1 phase arrest, the restraint of metastatic potential, and the enhancement of chemosensitivity. Further analysis revealed that MEOX2 negatively modulated the phosphatidyl-inositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of the rapamycin (mTOR) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) pathways. Reactivation of AKT by a chemical activator reversed MEOX2-mediated anticancer effects. An in vivo xenograft assay validated the anticancer function of MEOX2 in breast carcinoma. Taken together, these data show that MEOX2 exerts a cancer-inhibiting role in breast carcinoma by affecting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and ERK1/2 pathways. This work suggests MEOX2 as a new contributor for breast carcinoma progression, which may be a candidate target for anticancer therapy development.","['tcga data uncovered low levels', 'vivo xenograft assay validated', 'cellular function assays showed', 'chemical activator reversed meox2', 'time quantitative pcr', 'reduced overall survival', 'g1 phase arrest', 'clinical tumor specimens', 'anticancer therapy development', 'mesenchyme homeobox 2', 'mediated anticancer effects', 'initial expression analysis', 'work suggests meox2', 'meox2 negatively modulated', 'breast carcinoma progression', 'breast carcinoma patients', 'low levels', 'pi3k )/ akt', 'data show', 'anticancer function', 'immunoblotting assays', 'anticancer effects', 'forced expression', 'breast carcinoma', 'breast carcinoma', 'breast carcinoma', 'breast carcinoma', 'breast carcinoma', 'breast carcinoma', 'analysis revealed', 'taken together', 'several malignancies', 'research focused', 'regulated kinase', 'possible relevance', 'poorly expressed', 'new contributor', 'metastatic potential', 'mammalian target', 'inhibiting role', 'inhibiting role', 'extracellular signal', 'cell proliferation', 'candidate target', '3 kinase', 'meox2 exerts', '2 pathways', 'pi3k', '2', 'meox2', 'meox2', 'meox2', 'meox2', 'meox2', 'meox2', 'meox2', 'meox2', 'akt', 'akt', 'pathways', 'series', 'restraint', 'real', 'reactivation', 'rapamycin', 'phosphatidyl', 'observed', 'mtor', 'mtor', 'moreover', 'may', 'investigating', 'inositol', 'inhibition', 'induction', 'including', 'however', 'g0', 'found', 'erk1', 'erk1', 'enhancement', 'correlated', 'confirmed', 'chemosensitivity', 'cancer', 'cancer', 'association', 'affecting', 'addressed']"
"Women living in the Bolivian Andes are environmentally exposed to arsenic, yet there is scarce information about arsenic-related effects in this region. Several biomarkers for telomere length and oxidative stress (mitochondrial DNA copy number, mtDNAcn; 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine, 8-oxo-dG; and 4-hydroxy nonenal mercapturic acid, 4-HNE-MA) have been previously linked to arsenic, and some of which are prospective biomarkers for cancer risk.
To evaluate associations between arsenic exposure and telomere length, mtDNAcn, 8-oxo-dG, and 4-HNE-MA in Bolivians. Arsenic exposure was hypothesized to be positively associated with all four toxicity biomarkers, particularly in individuals with a less efficient arsenic metabolism.
The study encompassed 193 indigenous women. Arsenic exposure was assessed in urine as the sum of inorganic arsenic metabolite concentrations (U-As) measured by HPLC-HG-ICP-MS, and in whole blood as total arsenic (B-As) measured by ICP-MS. Efficiency of arsenic metabolism was evaluated by a polymorphism (rs3740393) in the main arsenic methylating gene AS3MT measured by TaqMan allelic discrimination, and by the relative fractions of urinary inorganic arsenic metabolites. Telomere length and mtDNAcn were determined in peripheral blood leukocytes by quantitative PCR, and urinary 8-oxo-dG and 4-HNE-MA by LC-MS/MS.
U-As and B-As were associated with longer telomeres and higher mtDNAcn, particularly in women with a less efficient arsenic metabolism. Urinary 8-oxo-dG and 4-HNE-MA were positively associated with U-As, but only 4-HNE-MA was associated with B-As. Arsenic metabolism efficiency did not have a clear effect on the concentrations of either of these biomarkers.
Bolivian women showed indications of arsenic toxicity, measured by four different biomarkers. Telomere length, mtDNAcn, and 4-HNE-MA were positively associated with both U-As and B-As. The association of arsenic exposure with telomere length and mtDNAcn was only present in Bolivian women with a less efficient metabolism. These findings call for additional efforts to evaluate and reduce arsenic exposure in Bolivia.","['main arsenic methylating gene as3mt measured', 'study encompassed 193 indigenous women', 'mitochondrial dna copy number', 'hydroxy nonenal mercapturic acid', 'bolivian women showed indications', 'urinary inorganic arsenic metabolites', 'less efficient arsenic metabolism', 'less efficient arsenic metabolism', 'inorganic arsenic metabolite concentrations', 'less efficient metabolism', 'taqman allelic discrimination', ""2 '- deoxyguanosine"", 'peripheral blood leukocytes', 'four different biomarkers', 'arsenic metabolism efficiency', 'reduce arsenic exposure', 'four toxicity biomarkers', 'arsenic metabolism', 'bolivian women', 'arsenic toxicity', 'arsenic exposure', 'arsenic exposure', 'arsenic exposure', 'arsenic exposure', 'women living', 'bolivian andes', 'total arsenic', 'whole blood', 'several biomarkers', 'prospective biomarkers', 'urinary 8', 'urinary 8', 'telomere length', 'telomere length', 'telomere length', 'telomere length', 'telomere length', 'scarce information', 'relative fractions', 'related effects', 'quantitative pcr', 'previously linked', 'oxidative stress', 'longer telomeres', 'findings call', 'environmentally exposed', 'clear effect', 'cancer risk', 'additional efforts', 'positively associated', 'positively associated', 'positively associated', 'evaluate associations', 'higher mtdnacn', 'women', 'arsenic', 'arsenic', 'arsenic', 'concentrations', 'measured', 'measured', 'measured', 'biomarkers', 'efficiency', 'associated', 'associated', 'evaluate', '8', '8', '8', 'mtdnacn', 'mtdnacn', 'mtdnacn', 'mtdnacn', 'mtdnacn', 'yet', 'urine', 'u', 'u', 'u', 'u', 'sum', 'rs3740393', 'region', 'present', 'polymorphism', 'particularly', 'particularly', 'oxo', 'oxo', 'oxo', 'oxo', 'oxo', 'ms', 'ms', 'ms', 'ms', 'lc', 'individuals', 'icp', 'icp', 'hypothesized', 'hplc', 'hne', 'hne', 'hne', 'hne', 'hne', 'hne', 'hg', 'evaluated', 'either', 'dg', 'dg', 'dg', 'dg', 'determined', 'bolivians', 'bolivia', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'association', 'assessed', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4']"
"The Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 provides conventional and standardized response assessment for multiple solid tumors. We investigated the smallest number of target lesions that can be measured without compromising response categorization and survival prediction in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (aNSCLC) undergoing anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy.
125 aNSCLC patients with at least two measurable lesions undergoing PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment were retrospectively studied. Tumor measurements allowing up to two lesions per organ and five lesions in total were reviewed. Inter-individual agreement and κ values for inter-method concordance on response status were evaluated based on up to five target lesions versus the largest one through four lesions. C-index was calculated to evaluate the prognostic accuracy of response categorization based on the selected number of target lesions for predicting overall survival (OS). Cox regression analysis was conducted for survival analysis.
The highly consistent response assignment (99.2%) could be obtained when measuring the largest two lesions versus up to five lesions. Using the largest two through four lesions produced κ values of 0.986, 1.000 and 1.000 for response assessment, values significantly higher than those obtained when measuring the largest single lesion (κ = 0.850). C-index for overall survival (OS) was similar when assessing the largest one through five lesions, ranging from 0.646 to 0.654. Cox regression analyses showed that radiological response significantly predicted OS, irrespective of the number of target lesions selected.
Reducing the number of target lesions does not affect OS prediction in aNSCLC patients treated with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Considering the high intra-individual and inter-method concordance, using the largest two lesions in total is proposed to assess response.","['least two measurable lesions undergoing pd', 'measured without compromising response categorization', 'radiological response significantly predicted os', 'four lesions produced κ values', 'highly consistent response assignment', 'cox regression analyses showed', 'two lesions per organ', 'largest two lesions versus', 'five target lesions versus', 'values significantly higher', 'response categorization based', 'largest two lesions', 'cox regression analysis', 'response evaluation criteria', 'tumor measurements allowing', 'cell lung cancer', '2 %) could', 'standardized response assessment', 'largest single lesion', 'l1 inhibitor treatment', 'affect os prediction', 'target lesions selected', 'multiple solid tumors', 'predicting overall survival', '125 ansclc patients', 'ansclc patients treated', '1 provides conventional', 'four lesions', 'largest two', 'κ values', 'response assessment', 'target lesions', 'target lesions', 'target lesions', 'five lesions', 'five lesions', 'five lesions', 'undergoing anti', 'response status', 'assess response', 'solid tumors', 'survival prediction', 'survival analysis', 'overall survival', 'os ).', 'largest one', 'largest one', 'evaluated based', 'l1 therapy', 'l1 monotherapy', 'selected number', 'retrospectively studied', 'prognostic accuracy', 'method concordance', 'method concordance', 'high intra', 'advanced non', '850 ).', 'smallest number', 'individual agreement', 'version 1', 'os', 'κ', 'patients', 'ansclc', 'pd', 'pd', 'pd', 'pd', 'pd', 'number', 'number', 'individual', 'anti', '1', '1', '1', '1', '1', 'using', 'using', 'total', 'total', 'small', 'similar', 'reviewed', 'reducing', 'recist', 'ranging', 'proposed', 'obtained', 'obtained', 'measuring', 'measuring', 'irrespective', 'investigated', 'inter', 'inter', 'inter', 'index', 'index', 'evaluate', 'considering', 'conducted', 'calculated', 'c', 'c', 'assessing', '99', '986', '654', '646', '000', '000', '0', '0', '0', '0']"

"To improve the visualization and potency of anticancer agents, the diagnosis and treatment integration bi-functional molecules were constructed based on active candidate BD7, approved drug Linifanib, and monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab. Commercial available Rhodamine B was inducted to realize imaging-aided diagnosis and target efficiency monitoring for cancer cells. In order to maintain the anticancer activity of drugs, disulfide bond was incorporated as releasable group based on tumor microenviroment. After design, synthesis and structure characterization of title compounds, various biological evaluation and cancer cell imaging analysis were carried out. The results indicated that these title diagnosis and treatment integration bi-functional molecules exhibited comparable potency with that of corresponding parent drug. Meanwhile, these agents afforded good performance in cell imaging and could be used to differentiate cancer cells from normal ovarian cells in real time. Further optimization of these bi-functional molecules is ongoing to improve the potency and precision and will be reported in due course.

"DDR (DNA damage response) defects in cells drive tumor formation by promoting DNA mutations, which also provides cancer-specific vulnerabilities that can be targeted by synthetic lethality-based therapies. Until now, PARP inhibitors like olaparib are the first successful case of utilizing synthetic lethality-based therapy to treat cancers with DNA-repairing deficiency (e.g. BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation), which has fueled the search for more targetable components in the DDR signaling pathway by exploiting synthetic lethality, including but not limited to DNA-PK, ATR, ATM, CHK1, and WEE1. After years of efforts, numerous DDR kinase inhibitors have been discovered. Some of them are being investigated in clinical trials and have shown promising results for cancer therapy. In this review, we summarize the latest advancement in the development of DDR kinase inhibitors including those in preclinical stages and clinical trials, the crystal structures of DDR enzymes, and binding modes of inhibitors with target proteins.

In general, the fluorescence properties of the probes themselves could meet the imaging requirements, and they have shown sufficient inhibitory activities against c-Met, especially probe 16, reflecting the targeting and acceptance. Also, fluorescence polarization assays and flow cytometry analysis verified the binding between the probes and c-Met.

"As clinical care practices are becoming more digitalised, information about patients is increasingly being encoded as quantified data, and the processes of sorting data are often supported by algorithmic computations. One such practice becoming more prevalent across Western countries is the clinical use of Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) data. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork carried out in a Danish setting among nurses managing PRO-based breast cancer follow-up, we examine how clinical decisions are made on the basis of PRO-data and what this requires from the nurses. By applying the concept of recontextualisation work as an analytical perspective, we shed light on the efforts of nurses when mobilising complementary information about patients in order to recontextualise the otherwise decontextualised data, thereby giving data practical value in clinical decision-making. Recontextualisation work, we show, is shaped by organisational structure, available resources, and nurses' professional capacity. Drawing analytical attention to the work of recontextualisation allows for a nuanced understanding of the efforts required to make data workable and hence what it takes to carry out clinical decisions in today's datafied healthcare system.","['danish setting among nurses managing pro', 'thereby giving data practical value', 'prevalent across western countries', 'based breast cancer follow', 'patient reported outcome', 'ethnographic fieldwork carried', 'datafied healthcare system', 'otherwise decontextualised data', 'make data workable', 'clinical care practices', 'mobilising complementary information', 'drawing analytical attention', 'analytical perspective', 'sorting data', 'quantified data', 'clinical use', 'clinical decisions', 'clinical decisions', 'clinical decision', 'shed light', 'recontextualisation allows', 'professional capacity', 'organisational structure', 'often supported', 'nuanced understanding', 'available resources', 'algorithmic computations', 'recontextualisation work', 'recontextualisation work', 'practice becoming', 'efforts required', 'pro', 'pro', 'data', 'data', 'nurses', 'nurses', 'nurses', 'information', 'drawing', 'work', 'efforts', 'becoming', 'today', 'takes', 'show', 'shaped', 'requires', 'recontextualise', 'processes', 'patients', 'patients', 'order', 'one', 'making', 'made', 'increasingly', 'hence', 'examine', 'encoded', 'digitalised', 'concept', 'carry', 'basis', 'applying']"
"The Pipeline-Embolization-Device (PED) has been used increasingly for intracranial-aneurysms. Despite the high-patency-rate of jailed branches following PED deployment, little is known about changes in these vessels size. This study measured change in size after PED.
This retrospective-study screened a database of 183-consecutive-patients treated with PED (07/2011-07/2017) across inclusion criteria. We included patients in whom the ophthalmic artery (OA) and/or the posterior communicating artery (PComA) were jailed by the PED. MRA was used to calculate change in cross-sectional-area (CSA) of these vessels. 29 patients who had MRA before and after treatment were included in the study. The CSA was measured automatically using Syngo®.via-software at fixed points along the analyzed vessels. After exclusion of low-quality and software non-capturable MRA-images, 16 OA and 23 PComA were included in the final analysis. Statistical Package for Social Sciences was used for analysis.
The mean CSA of PComA, P1-segement of posteriror-cerebral-artery (P1-PCA), and OA was 3.3 ± 1.3, 4.1 ± 1.2, and 3.2 ± 0.9 mm
Jailing PComA with a PED resulted in a statistically significant decrease in PComA CSA and a statistically non-significant increase in ipsilateral P1 CSA.

"Non-endoscopic cell collection devices combined with biomarkers can detect Barrett's intestinal metaplasia and early oesophageal cancer. However, assays performed on multi-cellular samples lose information about the cell source of the biomarker signal. This cross-sectional study examines whether a bespoke artificial intelligence-based computational pathology tool could ascertain the cellular origin of microRNA biomarkers, to inform interpretation of the disease pathology, and confirm biomarker validity.
The microRNA expression profiles of 110 targets were assessed with a custom multiplexed panel in a cohort of 117 individuals with reflux that took a Cytosponge test. A computational pathology tool quantified the amount of columnar epithelium present in pathology slides, and results were correlated with microRNA signals. An independent cohort of 139 Cytosponges, each from an individual patient, was used to validate the findings via qPCR.
Seventeen microRNAs are upregulated in BE compared to healthy squamous epithelia, of which 13 remain upregulated in dysplasia. A pathway enrichment analysis confirmed association to neoplastic and cell cycle regulation processes. Ten microRNAs positively correlated with columnar epithelium content, with miRNA-192-5p and -194-5p accurately detecting the presence of gastric cells (AUC 0.97 and 0.95). In contrast, miR-196a-5p is confirmed as a specific BE marker.
Computational pathology tools aid accurate cellular attribution of molecular signals. This innovative design with multiplex microRNA coupled with artificial intelligence has led to discovery of a quality control metric suitable for large scale application of the Cytosponge. Similar approaches could aid optimal interpretation of biomarkers for clinical use.

This trial assessed a maintenance strategy conditioned by response to cisplatin-gemcitabine (CG) with G continuation for patients with OR or switch to pemetrexed (P) for patients with SD as compared with a control arm based on the Paramount regimen.
Eligibility criteria: age 18-70 years, ECOG PS 0-1, untreated stage IV NS-NSCLC without EGFR or ALK alteration, ineligibility to bevacizumab. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either CG (4 cycles) followed by G maintenance in case of OR followed by P at progression, or switch to P for patients with SD, or 4 cycles of CP followed by P (control arm). Primary endpoint: overall Survival.
Between 2012 and 2016, 932 patients were randomized (CG: 467, CP: 465) with well-balanced characteristics. 257 patients (56.7%) in the CG arm received maintenance (G: 142, P: 113) versus 277 patients (59.7%) in the CP arm. Median number of maintenance cycles was 5 for G and P (CG induction) and 4 for P (CP induction). OS adjusted HR was 0.97 (95% CI 0.84, 1.13; p = 0.71) with a median of 10.9 months (CG) versus 10.4 (CP). HR for PFS was 0.95 (95% CI 0.83, 1.09; p = 0.45) with a median of 4.8 months for CG versus 4.5 for CP. Safety profile was as expected.

"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a prevalent liver malignancy, which ranks third in the cancer-related cause of deaths in worldwide and ninth in the United States. Currently, HCC is typically diagnosed by ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan at its late stage and the survival of HCC patients after diagnosis is usually very poor. Therefore, the development of novel and effective tool for early diagnosis, characterization and staging of HCC patients is of critical importance. Recent studies have demonstrated correlation of HCC with MAGL. In HCC cells, upregulation of MAGL activity enhanced cell invasiveness ability, while pharmacological blockade of MAGL led to significant inhibition of this trend. In this study, we aim to visualize the expression and activity of hepatic MAGL in different HCC cells and HCC patients' samples by taking advantage of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with our previously developed MAGL radioligand [","['magl activity enhanced cell invasiveness ability', 'previously developed magl radioligand', 'prevalent liver malignancy', 'positron emission tomography', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'different hcc cells', 'magl led', 'hepatic magl', 'computed tomography', 'hcc cells', 'united states', 'typically diagnosed', 'taking advantage', 'significant inhibition', 'related cause', 'recent studies', 'ranks third', 'pharmacological blockade', 'late stage', 'hepatocellular carcinoma', 'effective tool', 'demonstrated correlation', 'critical importance', 'hcc patients', 'hcc patients', 'hcc patients', 'early diagnosis', 'activity', 'magl', 'imaging', 'hcc', 'hcc', 'hcc', 'diagnosis', 'worldwide', 'visualize', 'usually', 'upregulation', 'ultrasound', 'trend', 'therefore', 'survival', 'study', 'staging', 'scan', 'samples', 'poor', 'pet', 'novel', 'ninth', 'mri', 'expression', 'development', 'deaths', 'currently', 'ct', 'characterization', 'cancer', 'aim']"
"Cortical mapping has been used as a tool to ensure maximal safe resection of intracranial tumors for several decades. Post-surgical motor and language deficits, including seizures, weakness, aphasia, and dysarthria have been well-documented in patients undergoing these operations, particularly on eloquent cortical regions. However, it is not known whether awake versus asleep cortical mapping contributes to differences in postoperative neurological deficits.
A comprehensive review of the literature utilizing the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines was completed for articles describing cortical mapping for tumor resection. We critically assessed all articles published in the last 20 years describing complications of patients who had undergone either awake or asleep motor mapping for eloquent brain tumor resection. Studies were analyzed for number of patients, follow-up duration, rates of transient and permanent motor and sensory deficits in the perioperative period, and outcomes at one-month follow-up.
Thirty-one studies met inclusion criteria, 24 of which reported long-term post-operative follow-up data. Follow-up among selected studies ranged from one month to four years. Nine of the 31 studies directly compared the postoperative outcomes of awake versus asleep mapping. The rate of transient deficits among patients who underwent awake and asleep mapping was 31.6% and 32.7%, respectively. The rate of permanent deficits was 10.8% in awake mapping patients and 12.7% in asleep mapping patients. Qualitative analysis showed that motor and sensory complications occurred at similar rates.
Review of the current evidence suggests that the rates of transient and permanent postoperative neurologic deficits among awake versus asleep cortical mapping groups are similar.

"This phase I trial (NCT01912625) evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics of definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cCRT) and the radiosensitizer trametinib (MEK1/2 inhibitor) for KRAS-mutated nonmetastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Patients received cCRT (carboplatin/paclitaxel and 60 Gy/30 fractions radiotherapy); oral trametinib (7 days/week) commenced on day 1 and completed on the final day of radiotherapy. Dose-finding of trametinib was done using the time-to-event continual reassessment method (TiTE-CRM); dose levels were 0.5mg (level -1), 1mg (initial, level 1), 1.5mg (level 2), and 2mg (level 3). Progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) times were also recorded.
Fifteen patients (stage III, variety of KRAS mutations) were treated, with 1/5/4/5 at dose levels -1/1/2/3, respectively. Five patients received dose reductions (n=2, levels 2 and 3; n=1, level 1). Twelve patients completed the full cCRT course. One patient (following 12d trametinib) was taken off protocol for an unrelated/unresolved grade 1 event and later experienced grade 5 sepsis/respiratory failure. There was one grade 4 retinal detachment; grade 3 events included skin rash (n=2) and ventricular dysfunction, pneumonitis, pain, fatigue, and diarrhea (n=1 each). The final dose selected by the TiTE-CRM of trametinib was 1.5 mg. Pharmacokinetic profiles were elucidated and extensively described. At median follow-up of 70 months, median PFS was 11 months and median OS was 38 months.

"The US Food and Drug Administration recently announced its intention to pursue a federal ban on menthol cigarettes. This qualitative study assessed reactions to a potential menthol cigarette ban among people who smoke menthol cigarettes.
As part of a laboratory study examining menthol flavor regulations, we conducted follow-up interviews with participants who smoke menthol cigarettes (N = 35). We explored the following topics: (1) menthol cigarette risk perceptions; (2) knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of menthol cigarette regulations; and (3) anticipated behavior if menthol cigarettes were banned. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, double-coded, and analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis.
Many participants thought menthol cigarettes carried more health risks than non-menthol cigarettes. Some participants said regulators wanted to ban menthol cigarettes because they appeal to youth. Others thought a ban would be good for public health because fewer people, particularly youth, would smoke. Several voiced skepticism about banning only menthol cigarettes rather than all cigarettes. Most said they would use other products, including electronic cigarettes or non-menthol cigarettes, but many also thought a menthol ban could motivate them or others to quit smoking.
Banning menthol cigarettes could lead some people who smoke menthol cigarettes to switch to potentially less harmful products, like e-cigarettes, or quit smoking, which would likely benefit public health; however, others may simply transition to non-menthol cigarettes. As regulators move forward with banning menthol cigarettes, communication campaigns explaining the public health benefits, potentially focusing on the benefits for youth, should be part of the policy implementation plan.","['laboratory study examining menthol flavor regulations', 'potential menthol cigarette ban among people', 'analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis', 'many participants thought menthol cigarettes carried', 'would likely benefit public health', 'banning menthol cigarettes could lead', 'qualitative study assessed reactions', 'drug administration recently announced', 'menthol ban could motivate', 'others may simply transition', 'menthol cigarette risk perceptions', 'participants said regulators wanted', 'potentially less harmful products', 'menthol cigarette regulations', 'many also thought', 'ban menthol cigarettes', 'regulators move forward', 'menthol cigarettes rather', 'banning menthol cigarettes', 'several voiced skepticism', 'policy implementation plan', 'communication campaigns explaining', 'smoke menthol cigarettes', 'smoke menthol cigarettes', 'smoke menthol cigarettes', 'including electronic cigarettes', 'public health benefits', 'public health', 'menthol cigarettes', 'menthol cigarettes', 'menthol cigarettes', 'menthol cigarettes', 'menthol cigarettes', 'ban would', 'others thought', 'would smoke', 'federal ban', 'potentially focusing', 'health risks', 'fewer people', 'would use', 'us food', 'transcribed verbatim', 'quit smoking', 'quit smoking', 'like e', 'following topics', 'conducted follow', 'anticipated behavior', '35 ).', 'participants', 'particularly youth', 'people', 'banning', 'cigarettes', 'cigarettes', 'said', 'products', 'perceptions', 'others', 'benefits', 'youth', 'youth', 'switch', 'recorded', 'pursue', 'part', 'part', 'non', 'non', 'non', 'n', 'knowledge', 'interviews', 'interviews', 'intention', 'however', 'good', 'explored', 'double', 'coded', 'banned', 'audio', 'attitudes', 'appeal', '3', '2', '1']"
"Diffuse midline glioma (DMG), H3 K27M-mutant including diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a disease with dismal prognosis. We focused on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and gadolinium enhanced T1WI (Gd), especially high intensity on DWI at non-enhanced lesion, i.e. DWI-Gd mismatch sign, to establish as an imaging biomarker of DMG patients.
Our institutional review board approved this retrospective study. Twenty-one patients diagnosed as DMG including DIPG at our institution between 2007 and 2020 were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent local radiotherapy of 54 Gy/30 fractions. We studied the relationship between imaging features including DWI-Gd mismatch sign and prognosis.
DWI-Gd mismatch sign was found in 9 out of 21 DMG patients. Among different imaging characteristics, existence of high intensity on DWI (P = 0.0014), gadolinium enhancement (P = 0.00071) were the significant poor prognostic markers in DMG, which were consistent with the previous reports about DIPG. In our results, positive DWI-Gd mismatch sign was statistically strongest poor prognostic imaging biomarker, and patients with positive DWI-Gd mismatch sign had shorter OS compared to those with negative mismatch sign (9.9 months vs 18.6 months, P = 0.00062). DWI/Gd mismatch sign and intratumoral bleeding were more common in DMG at thalamus compared to DMG at pons/DIPG (P = 0.046 and P = 0.0017, respectively).

"Due to the malignancy of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), investigations of novel therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers are urgently needed. In our present study, significant up-regulation of Actin-like protein 8 (ACTL8) in OSCC patients was observed by bioinformatics analysis with RNA sequencing data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The results of Chi-square test revealed that there was a significant correlation between ACTL8 expression and tumor status (T1 + T2/T3+T4) (P = 0.004). Survival analysis indicated a negative correlation between ACTL8 overexpression and prognosis in OSCC (P = 3.984e-02). An ACTL8 knockdown experiment was conducted to evaluate the function of ACTL8 on OSCC cell biological behaviors. The results revealed that knockdown of ACTL8 significantly inhibited the growth and mobility, arrested cell cycle and promoted apoptosis of TCA-83 and CAL27 cells. Moreover, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and western blots demonstrated that activation of cell cycle signaling pathway was inhibited by knockdown of ACTL8, as we observed the down-regulation of 4 key proteins (CDK1, cyclin E1, cyclin B2 and c-Myc) in this pathway. The present investigation indicates that ACTL8 plays an oncogenic role in the pathogenesis of OSCC, suggesting that ACTL8 may be a promising therapeutic target and prognosis marker for human OSCC.","['rna sequencing data obtained', 'oral squamous cell carcinoma', 'gene set enrichment analysis', 'oscc cell biological behaviors', 'cell cycle signaling pathway', 'arrested cell cycle', 'western blots demonstrated', 'survival analysis indicated', 'promising therapeutic target', 'novel therapeutic targets', 'like protein 8', 'cancer genome atlas', '4 key proteins', 'square test revealed', 'present investigation indicates', 'oscc ), investigations', 'actl8 significantly inhibited', 'actl8 knockdown experiment', 'bioinformatics analysis', 'present study', 'oscc patients', 'human oscc', 'urgently needed', 'tumor status', 'results revealed', 'promoted apoptosis', 'prognostic biomarkers', 'oncogenic role', 'negative correlation', 'cyclin e1', 'cyclin b2', 'cal27 cells', '02 ).', '004 ).', 'actl8 plays', 'actl8 overexpression', 'actl8 may', 'actl8 expression', 'significant correlation', 'prognosis marker', 'pathway', 'oscc', 'oscc', 'inhibited', 'actl8', 'actl8', 'actl8', 'knockdown', 'knockdown', 'significant', 'results', 'prognosis', 'tcga', 'tca', 't4', 't3', 't2', 't1', 'suggesting', 'regulation', 'regulation', 'pathogenesis', 'p', 'p', 'observed', 'observed', 'myc', 'moreover', 'mobility', 'malignancy', 'gsea', 'growth', 'function', 'evaluate', 'due', 'database', 'conducted', 'chi', 'cdk1', 'c', 'activation', 'actin', '984e', '83', '3', '0']"
"Despite elderly populations having a greater risk of being diagnosed with serious medical conditions, there has been limited clinical testing conducted on geriatric patients. By analyzing cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and type 2 diabetes data from ClinicalTrials.gov, we investigate two factors that may have significant impact on the exclusion of elderly patients from clinical trials.
We examine age exclusion across phases and funder types and demonstrate the extent of these exclusions over all interventional studies that commenced enrollment on or after January 2010 to Oct 2021.
Cancer trials have the lowest percentage of age capped enrollment, with 22.18%, 24.13%, and 32.77% of the studies listing an upper age limit in Phases 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

Twenty-five patients who were diagnosed with early-stage cervical cancer from June 2017 to October 2020 in Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital.
Laparoscopic radical trachelectomy with the ""cuff-sleeve"" suture method for cervicovaginal reconstruction.
Twenty-five patients successfully underwent the laparoscopic radical trachelectomy with the ""cuff-sleeve"" suture method for cervicovaginal reconstruction, and no intraoperative complications occurred or conversion to laparotomy was needed. For all patients, approximately 80% of the cervical length was removed. Surgical radicality and negative surgical margins were also confirmed. During a median follow-up time of 29 months (range 8-48 months), no severe postoperative complications were observed. No cervical stenosis or secondary abnormal menstruation was reported. After the removal of the uterine stent 6 months after surgery, the neocervix length was about 14mm (range 10-19mm) and almost all the neocervixes were restored closely to the original anatomy. Four of 8 patients attempting actively to conceive were successful, and the cervical length of these pregnant patients was greater than or equal to 15mm in all but one measurement at different gestational age.

"Preference for dietary fat vs. carbohydrate varies markedly across free-living individuals. It is recognized that food choice is under genetic and physiological regulation, and that the central melanocortin system is involved. However, how genetic and dietary factors interact to regulate relative macronutrient intake is not well understood.
We investigated how the choice for food rich in carbohydrate vs. fat is influenced by dietary cholesterol availability and agouti-related protein (AGRP), the orexigenic component of the central melanocortin system. We assessed how macronutrient intake and different metabolic parameters correlate with plasma AGRP in a cohort of obese humans. We also examined how both dietary cholesterol levels and inhibiting de novo cholesterol synthesis affect carbohydrate and fat intake in mice, and how dietary cholesterol deficiency during the postnatal period impacts macronutrient intake patterns in adulthood.
In obese human subjects, plasma levels of AGRP correlated inversely with consumption of carbohydrates over fats. Moreover, AgRP-deficient mice preferred to consume more calories from carbohydrates than fats, more so when each diet lacked cholesterol. Intriguingly, inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis (simvastatin) promoted carbohydrate intake at the expense of fat without altering total caloric consumption, an effect that was remarkably absent in AgRP-deficient mice. Finally, feeding lactating C57BL/6 dams and pups a cholesterol-free diet prior to weaning led the offspring to prefer fats over carbohydrates as adults, indicating that altered cholesterol metabolism early in life programs adaptive changes to macronutrient intake.
Together, our study illustrates a specific gene-diet-drug interaction in modulating food choice.","['inhibiting de novo cholesterol synthesis affect carbohydrate', 'postnatal period impacts macronutrient intake patterns', 'fat without altering total caloric consumption', 'carbohydrate varies markedly across free', 'life programs adaptive changes', 'different metabolic parameters correlate', 'altered cholesterol metabolism early', 'regulate relative macronutrient intake', 'inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis', 'promoted carbohydrate intake', 'dietary cholesterol deficiency', 'dietary cholesterol availability', 'free diet prior', 'feeding lactating c57bl', 'dietary factors interact', 'central melanocortin system', 'central melanocortin system', 'dietary cholesterol levels', 'diet lacked cholesterol', 'obese human subjects', 'dietary fat vs', 'agrp correlated inversely', 'deficient mice preferred', 'modulating food choice', 'carbohydrate vs', 'macronutrient intake', 'macronutrient intake', 'fat intake', 'plasma levels', 'obese humans', 'deficient mice', 'food rich', 'food choice', 'well understood', 'weaning led', 'study illustrates', 'specific gene', 'remarkably absent', 'related protein', 'physiological regulation', 'orexigenic component', 'living individuals', 'drug interaction', 'also examined', '6 dams', 'plasma agrp', 'agrp ),', 'consumption', 'cholesterol', 'prefer fats', 'fat', 'diet', 'mice', 'choice', 'agrp', 'agrp', 'fats', 'fats', 'together', 'simvastatin', 'recognized', 'pups', 'preference', 'offspring', 'moreover', 'involved', 'investigated', 'intriguingly', 'influenced', 'indicating', 'however', 'genetic', 'genetic', 'finally', 'expense', 'effect', 'consume', 'cohort', 'carbohydrates', 'carbohydrates', 'carbohydrates', 'calories', 'assessed', 'agouti', 'adults', 'adulthood']"
"There are no detailed reports of clinical outcomes in Asian patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) who undergo liver biopsy. We aimed to investigate the clinical outcomes of a large cohort of Asian patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and evaluate the specific effects of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis stage.
This multicenter registry-based retrospective cohort study, called the CLIONE-NAFLD (clinical outcome nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) in Asia, included 1398 patients.
The median follow-up period was 4.6 years (range, 0.3-21.6), representing a total of 8,874 person-years of follow-up. During that time, 47 patients died and one patient underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. The leading cause of death was nonhepatic cancer (n=10). The leading causes of liver-related death were liver failure (n=9), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (n=8), and cholangiocellular carcinoma (n=4). During follow-up, 37 patients developed HCC, 31 developed cardiovascular disease, and 68 developed nonhepatic cancer (mainly breast, stomach, and colon/rectum). Among our cohort of patients with NAFLD, liver-specific mortality was 2.34/1,000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.52-3.58), overall mortality was 5.34/1,000 person-years (95% CI 4.02-7.08), and HCC incidence was 4.17/1,000 person-years (95% CI 3.02-5.75). Liver fibrosis was independently associated with liver-related events but not overall mortality.
Liver-related mortality was the leading cause of mortality in Asian patients with biopsy-confirmed NAFLD.

"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) which is typically preceded from oral leukoplakia (OL), is a common malignancy with poor prognosis. However, the signaling molecules governing this progression remain to be defined. Based on microarray analysis of genes expressed in OL and OSCC samples, we discovered that LncRNA IFITM4P was highly expressed in OSCC and ectopic expression or knockdown of IFITM4P resulted in increased or decreased cell proliferation in vitro and in xenografted tumors respectively. Mechanistically, in the cytoplasm IFITM4P acted as a scaffold to facilitate recruiting SASH1 to bind and phosphorylate TAK1 (Thr187), and in turn to increase the phosphorylation of NF-κB (Ser536) and concomitant induction of PD-L1 expression, resulting in activation of an immunosuppressive program that allows OL cells to escape anti-cancer immunity in cytoplasm. In nucleus, IFITM4P reduced Pten transcription by enhancing the binding of KDM5A to the Pten promoter, thereby upregulating PD-L1 in OL cells. Moreover, mice bearing tumors with high IFITM4P expression had notable therapeutic sensitivity to PD-1 mAb treatment. Collectively, these data demonstrate that IFITM4P may serve as a new therapeutic target in blockage of oral carcinogenesis, and PD-1 mAb can be an efective reagent to treat OSCC.","['oral squamous cell carcinoma', 'ifitm4p reduced pten transcription', 'decreased cell proliferation', 'xenografted tumors respectively', 'signaling molecules governing', 'notable therapeutic sensitivity', 'new therapeutic target', 'mice bearing tumors', 'facilitate recruiting sash1', 'ifitm4p may serve', 'high ifitm4p expression', '1 mab treatment', 'cytoplasm ifitm4p acted', 'thereby upregulating pd', 'allows ol cells', 'pten promoter', '1 mab', 'lncrna ifitm4p', 'ifitm4p resulted', 'oral leukoplakia', 'oral carcinogenesis', 'ol cells', 'ectopic expression', 'typically preceded', 'thr187 ),', 'progression remain', 'poor prognosis', 'phosphorylate tak1', 'ol ),', 'microarray analysis', 'immunosuppressive program', 'highly expressed', 'genes expressed', 'escape anti', 'efective reagent', 'data demonstrate', 'concomitant induction', 'common malignancy', 'cancer immunity', 'l1 expression', 'treat oscc', 'oscc samples', 'ol', 'cytoplasm', 'pd', 'pd', 'pd', 'oscc', 'oscc', 'l1', 'κb', 'vitro', 'turn', 'ser536', 'scaffold', 'resulting', 'phosphorylation', 'nucleus', 'nf', 'moreover', 'mechanistically', 'knockdown', 'kdm5a', 'increased', 'increase', 'however', 'enhancing', 'discovered', 'defined', 'collectively', 'blockage', 'binding', 'bind', 'based', 'activation']"
"Therapy induced senescence (TIS) in tumors and TIS cancer cells secrete proinflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) factors. SASP factors promote TIS cancer cells to re-enter the growth cycle with stemness characteristics, resulting in chemo-resistance and disease relapse. Herein, we showed that the immunotherapeutic HCW9218, comprising TGF-β receptor II and IL-15/IL-15 receptor α domains, enhanced metabolic and cytotoxic activities of immune cells and reduced TIS tumor cells in vivo to improve the efficacy of docetaxel and gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel against B16F10 melanoma and SW1990 pancreatic tumors, respectively. Mechanistically, HCW9218 treatment reduced the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and enhanced immune-cell infiltration and cytotoxicity in the tumors to eliminate TIS cancer cells. Immuno-depletion analysis suggested that HCW9218-activated natural killer cells played a pivotal role in TIS cancer cell removal. HCW9218 treatment following docetaxel chemotherapy further enhanced efficacy of tumor antigen-specific and anti-PDL-1 antibodies in B16F10 tumor-bearing mice. We also show that HCW9218 treatment decreased TIS cells and lowered SASP factors in off-target tissues caused by chemotherapy of tumor-bearing mice.

"Indoleamine-2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO1) and Tryptophan-2, 3-dioxygense (TDO) are heme-containing dioxygenases that catalyze the conversion of tryptophan to N-formyl-kynurenine and thus enable generation of l-kynurenine and related metabolites that govern the immune response and broadly impact human biology. Given that TDO and IDO1 activities are directly proportional to their heme contents, it is important to understand their heme delivery and insertion processes. Early studies established that TDO and IDO1 heme levels are sub-saturating in vivo and subject to change but did not identify the cellular mechanisms that provide their heme or enable dynamic changes in their heme contents. We investigated the potential involvement of GAPDH and chaperone Hsp90, based on our previous studies linking these proteins to intracellular heme allocation. We studied heme delivery and insertion into IDO1 and TDO expressed in both normal and heme-deficient HEK293T cells and into IDO1 naturally expressed in HeLa cells in response to IFN-γ, and also investigated the interactions of TDO and IDO1 with GAPDH and Hsp90 in cells and among their purified forms. We found that GAPDH delivered both mitochondrially-generated and exogenous heme to apo-IDO1 and apo-TDO in cells, potentially through a direct interaction with either enzyme. In contrast, we found Hsp90 interacted with apo-IDO1 but not with apo-TDO, and was only needed to drive heme insertion into apo-IDO1. By uncovering the cellular processes that allocate heme to IDO1 and TDO, our study provides new insight on how their activities and l-kynurenine production may be controlled in health and disease.","['study provides new insight', 'broadly impact human biology', 'thus enable generation', 'previous studies linking', 'enable dynamic changes', 'early studies established', 'intracellular heme allocation', 'deficient hek293t cells', 'kynurenine production may', 'studied heme delivery', 'drive heme insertion', 'ido1 naturally expressed', 'found hsp90 interacted', 'ido1 heme levels', 'heme delivery', 'heme contents', 'heme contents', 'exogenous heme', 'allocate heme', 'related metabolites', 'purified forms', 'potential involvement', 'insertion processes', 'either enzyme', 'directly proportional', 'direct interaction', 'containing dioxygenases', 'chaperone hsp90', 'cellular processes', 'cellular mechanisms', 'hela cells', 'tdo expressed', 'immune response', 'also investigated', 'gapdh delivered', 'ido1 activities', 'heme', 'heme', 'heme', 'insertion', 'hsp90', 'found', 'cells', 'cells', 'kynurenine', 'kynurenine', 'response', 'investigated', 'ido1', 'ido1', 'ido1', 'ido1', 'ido1', 'ido1', 'ido1', 'activities', 'gapdh', 'gapdh', 'tdo', 'tdo', 'tdo', 'tdo', 'tdo', 'tdo', 'tdo', 'γ', 'vivo', 'understand', 'uncovering', 'tryptophan', 'tryptophan', 'subject', 'sub', 'saturating', 'provide', 'proteins', 'potentially', 'normal', 'needed', 'n', 'mitochondrially', 'l', 'l', 'interactions', 'indoleamine', 'important', 'ifn', 'identify', 'health', 'govern', 'given', 'generated', 'formyl', 'disease', 'dioxygense', 'dioxygenase', 'conversion', 'controlled', 'contrast', 'change', 'catalyze', 'based', 'apo', 'apo', 'apo', 'apo', 'apo', 'among', '3', '3', '2', '2']"
"Paonia suffruticosa Andr. belonging to the family Paeoniaceae and has been used as a medicinal plant in Asian countries including China, Korea, and Japan. The roots of P. suffruticosa has been used in traditional medicine in various diseases including cancer and cardiovascular, female genital, and inflammatory diseases.
Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) pathologically account for 90% of all head and neck cancers. However, effective targeted therapies for HNSCCs are insufficient and the prognosis is very poor, especially in patients with metastatic HNSCCs. To overcome the current limitations of available therapies for HNSCCs, pathological approaches using natural compounds are attracting attention. Our study aimed to demonstrate the anti-cancer effects of paeoniflorigenone (Paeo, 98.9% purity) isolated from the root bark of P. suffruticosa.
Our scientific methodology was performed as follows: cytotoxicity, morphological changes, and apototic DNA fragmentation were analyzed using MTT, light microscopy, and TUNEL assays. Protein expression, apoptosis, necroptosis, and autophagy were analyzed using Western blot and immunofluorescence assays. Cell migration and invasion were analyzed using wound healing and Boyden chamber assays.
We demonstrated that Paeo significantly reduced cell proliferation and cell division, leading to caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death in human YD-10B HNSCC cells. This result was associated with PI3K/AKT/mTOR/p70S6K signaling in these cells. In addition, we investigated other programmed cell death mechanisms associated with apoptosis and found that Paeo inhibited necroptosis via dephosphorylation of key necroptotic proteins (RIP and MLKL), whereas Paeo induced autophagy via increased LC3I/II expression and autophagosome formation in human YD-10B HNSCC cells. The anti-metastatic effects of Paeo significantly suppressed cell migration and invasion in human YD-10B HNSCC cells.

"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7 and 8 are key targets in the development of immunomodulatory drugs for treating infectious disease, cancer, and autoimmune disorders. These receptors can adopt both agonist and antagonist binding conformations that switch the receptor signal on or off to the downstream production of cytokines. In this study, we examined the effect of simple isomeric substitutions to the C2-butyl group of two imidazoquinoline agonists and evaluated the activity of these analogs using both TLR7 and TLR8 reporter cells and cytokine induction assays. Results are presented showing the C2-isobutyl and C2-cyclopropylmethyl isomers are both mixed TLR7/8 competitive antagonists of the parent agonist [4-Amino-1-(4-(aminomethyl)benzyl)-2-butyl-7-methoxycarbonyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline], indicating the conformation of the dimeric receptor complex is highly sensitive to steric perturbations to the ligand binding pocket. This observation is consistent with prior work demonstrating TLR7 and TLR8 activity is directly correlated to C2-alkyl substitutions that project into a hydrophobic pocket at the dimer interface of the receptor. The close structural relationship of the agonist/antagonist pairs identified here highlights the importance of this pocket in tipping the balance between the agonist and antagonist binding states of the receptor which may have significant ramifications to the design of imidazoquinoline-based immunomodulatory agents.","['1 -( 4 -( aminomethyl', 'prior work demonstrating tlr7', 'treating infectious disease', 'quinoline ], indicating', 'cytokine induction assays', 'close structural relationship', 'benzyl )- 2', 'antagonist pairs identified', 'antagonist binding states', 'antagonist binding conformations', 'tlr8 reporter cells', 'simple isomeric substitutions', 'based immunomodulatory agents', 'two imidazoquinoline agonists', 'ligand binding pocket', '8 competitive antagonists', 'dimeric receptor complex', 'immunomodulatory drugs', 'alkyl substitutions', 'mixed tlr7', 'tlr8 activity', 'steric perturbations', 'significant ramifications', 'presented showing', 'key targets', 'hydrophobic pocket', 'highly sensitive', 'downstream production', 'directly correlated', 'dimer interface', 'cyclopropylmethyl isomers', 'autoimmune disorders', 'analogs using', 'receptor signal', 'like receptors', 'butyl group', 'parent agonist', 'tlr7', '4', '4', 'pocket', 'imidazoquinoline', '8', 'receptor', 'receptor', 'receptors', 'butyl', 'activity', 'agonist', 'agonist', 'agonist', 'toll', 'tlrs', 'tipping', 'switch', 'study', 'results', 'project', 'observation', 'methoxycarbonyl', 'may', 'isobutyl', 'importance', 'imidazo', 'highlights', 'examined', 'evaluated', 'effect', 'development', 'design', 'cytokines', 'consistent', 'conformation', 'cancer', 'c2', 'c2', 'c2', 'c2', 'c', 'balance', 'amino', 'adopt', '7', '7', '5', '1h']"
"PES (2-phenylethynesulfonamide, pifithrin-μ, PFTμ) is an electrophilic compound that exhibits anticancer properties, protects against chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy in chemotherapy, and shows immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and anti-viral activities. PES generally shows higher cytotoxicity towards tumor cells than non-tumor cells. The mechanism of action of PES is unclear but may involve the covalent modification of proteins as PES has been found to be a covalent inhibitor of Hsp70. We developed a new PES derivative PESA with a terminal alkynyl group to perform click-reaction-assisted activity-based protein profiling (click-reaction ABPP) and used this to screen for cellular targets of PES. We found PES and its derivatives PES-Cl and PESA have comparable ability to undergo a Michael addition reaction with GSH and Hsp70, and showed similar cytotoxicity. By fluorescence imaging and proteomics studies we identified over 300 PESA-attached proteins in DOHH2 cells. Some proteins involved in cancer-related redox processes, such as peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1), showed higher frequency and abundance in mass spectrometry detection. Our results suggest that cytotoxicity of PES and its derivatives may be related to attack of protein thiols and cellular GSH resulting in breakdown of cellular redox homeostasis.

"Glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1) is a core component of the Hedgehog (HH) signalling pathway and is a transcription activator of numerous oncogenes, such as SOX9, VEGFA, BCL2, and CDK2. The complex regulation of GLI1 involves numerous pathways and molecules, including HH-dependent and independent, epigenetic and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Here, we report the discovery, characterization and function of a novel sense promoter-associated ncRNA, paGLI1 that is overexpressed in infiltrating glioma. We show that paGLI1 promotes GLI1 gene transcription through binding to and recruitment of the transcription factor complex FUS/P65 by interacting with paGLI1 DNA sequence. This interaction facilitates FUS/P65 binding to the GLI1 promoter to activate GLI1 transcription and hence its downstream oncogenes, which results in enhancement of glioma cell proliferation and invasiveness. Importantly, over-expression of paGLI1 is a significant unfavorable prognosticator for both disease-specific and progression-free survival in glioma patients, with relative risks being 2.932 (95% confidence interval: 1.280 to 6.713) (P < 0.05) and 2.284 (95% confidence interval: 1.051 to 4.966) (P < 0.05), respectively.

"The vascular dysfunction of ovarian cancer (OC) contributes to the chemotherapeutic resistance. In this study, we aimed to explore whether exosome-mediated angiogenesis blocking could improve the chemotherapy sensitivity via vascular normalization. Exosomes were armed with RGD on the surface by fusing Lamp2b. Candidate miRNAs related to tumor angiogenesis was detected by qRT-PCR. RGD-modified exosomes were loaded with miRNAs via electroporation. The therapeutic effects of the exosomes on angiogenesis, vascular normalization, and chemotherapy sensitivity were systemically analyzed in the xenograft model. RGD-modified exosomes were relatively enriched in the tumor mass, both the tumor cell and the endothelial cells. Among the miRNA candidates, miR-484 was found down-regulated in both the cancer cells and the angiogenic endothelial cells. In vivo xenograft model experiment revealed that injection of RGD-modified exosomes loaded with miR-484 induced vessel normalization and in turn sensitized the cancer cells to chemotherapy induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, miR-484 simultaneously inhibited the expression of VEGF-A from the cancer cells and the corresponding receptors in the endothelial cells. Targeted delivery of miR-484 via RGD-modified exosomes improves the vascular normalization, sensitizes the cancer to chemotherapy, and prolongs the survival time of tumor-bearing mice after chemotherapy, opening an avenue for the clinical management of chemotherapy resistance.","['mediated angiogenesis blocking could improve', 'vivo xenograft model experiment revealed', 'chemotherapy sensitivity via vascular normalization', '484 induced vessel normalization', 'mirnas via electroporation', 'explore whether exosome', 'candidate mirnas related', 'chemotherapy induced apoptosis', '484 simultaneously inhibited', '484 via rgd', 'modified exosomes improves', 'angiogenic endothelial cells', 'xenograft model', 'modified exosomes loaded', 'vascular normalization', 'vascular normalization', 'chemotherapy sensitivity', 'vascular dysfunction', 'modified exosomes', 'modified exosomes', 'endothelial cells', 'endothelial cells', 'tumor angiogenesis', 'chemotherapy resistance', 'turn sensitized', 'therapeutic effects', 'targeted delivery', 'systemically analyzed', 'survival time', 'relatively enriched', 'mirna candidates', 'fusing lamp2b', 'corresponding receptors', 'clinical management', 'chemotherapeutic resistance', 'bearing mice', 'cancer cells', 'cancer cells', 'cancer cells', 'ovarian cancer', 'tumor mass', 'tumor cell', '484', 'angiogenesis', 'chemotherapy', 'chemotherapy', 'loaded', 'exosomes', 'exosomes', 'cancer', 'tumor', 'rgd', 'rgd', 'rgd', 'rgd', 'vegf', 'surface', 'study', 'sensitizes', 'regulated', 'qrt', 'prolongs', 'pcr', 'opening', 'oc', 'mir', 'mir', 'mir', 'mir', 'mechanistically', 'injection', 'found', 'expression', 'detected', 'contributes', 'avenue', 'armed', 'among', 'aimed']"
"During disease progression from primary towards metastatic prostate cancer (PCa), and in particular bone metastases, the tumor microenvironment (TME) evolves in parallel with the cancer clones, altering extracellular matrix composition, vasculature architecture, and recruiting specialized tumor-supporting cells that favor tumor spread and colonization at distant sites. We introduce the clinical profile of advanced metastatic PCa in terms of common genetic alterations. Findings from recently developed models of PCa metastatic spread are discussed, focusing mainly on the role of the TME (mainly matrix and fibroblast cell types), at distinct stages: premetastatic niche orchestrated by the primary tumor towards the metastatic site and bone metastasis. We report evidence of premetastatic niche formation, such as the mechanisms of distant site conditioning by extracellular vesicles, chemokines and other tumor-derived mechanisms, including altered cancer cell-ECM interactions. Furthermore, evidence supporting the similarities of stroma alterations among the primary PCa and bone metastasis, and contribution of TME to androgen deprivation therapy resistance are also discussed. We summarize the available bone metastasis transgenic mouse models of PCa from a perspective of pro-metastatic TME alterations during disease progression and give an update on the current diagnostic and therapeutic radiological strategies for bone metastasis clinical management.","['available bone metastasis transgenic mouse models', 'primary towards metastatic prostate cancer', 'androgen deprivation therapy resistance', 'including altered cancer cell', 'fibroblast cell types ),', 'altering extracellular matrix composition', 'bone metastasis clinical management', 'recently developed models', 'primary tumor towards', 'particular bone metastases', 'therapeutic radiological strategies', 'stroma alterations among', 'premetastatic niche orchestrated', 'premetastatic niche formation', 'common genetic alterations', 'recruiting specialized tumor', 'pca metastatic spread', 'favor tumor spread', 'advanced metastatic pca', 'distant site conditioning', 'metastatic tme alterations', 'bone metastasis', 'bone metastasis', 'metastatic site', 'cancer clones', 'primary pca', 'pca ),', 'mainly matrix', 'extracellular vesicles', 'clinical profile', 'distant sites', 'tumor microenvironment', 'vasculature architecture', 'supporting cells', 'report evidence', 'focusing mainly', 'evidence supporting', 'ecm interactions', 'distinct stages', 'disease progression', 'disease progression', 'current diagnostic', 'derived mechanisms', 'also discussed', 'tumor', 'pca', 'tme', 'tme', 'tme', 'mechanisms', 'discussed', 'update', 'terms', 'summarize', 'similarities', 'role', 'pro', 'perspective', 'parallel', 'introduce', 'give', 'furthermore', 'findings', 'evolves', 'contribution', 'colonization', 'chemokines']"
"The DNA damage response (DDR) pathway generally protects against genome instability, and defects in DDR have been exploited therapeutically in cancer treatment. We have reported that histone demethylase PHF8 demethylates TOPBP1 K118 mono-methylation (K118me1) to drive the activation of ATR kinase, one of the master regulators of replication stress. However, whether dysregulation of this physiological signalling is involved in tumorigenesis remains unknown. Here, we showed PHF8-promoted TOPBP1 demethylation is clinically associated with breast tumorigenesis and patient survival. Mammary gland tumors from Phf8 knockout mice grow slowly and exhibit higher level of K118me1, lower ATR activity, and increased chromosomal instability. Importantly, we found that disruption of PHF8-TOPBP1 axis suppresses breast tumorigenesis and creates a breast tumor-specific vulnerability to PARP inhibitor (PARPi) and platinum drug. CRISPR/Cas9 mutation modelling of the deleted or truncated mutation of PHF8 in clinical tumor samples demonstrated breast tumor cells expressing the mimetic variants are more vulnerable to PARPi. Together, our study supports the pursuit of PHF8-TOPBP1 signalling pathway as promising avenues for targeted therapies of PHF8-TOPBP1 proficient tumors, and provides proof-of-concept evidence for loss-of-function of PHF8 as a therapeutic indicator of PARPis.","['clinical tumor samples demonstrated breast tumor cells expressing', 'histone demethylase phf8 demethylates topbp1 k118 mono', 'phf8 knockout mice grow slowly', 'topbp1 axis suppresses breast tumorigenesis', 'breast tumor', 'topbp1 proficient tumors', 'promoted topbp1 demethylation', 'topbp1 signalling pathway', 'tumorigenesis remains unknown', 'pathway generally protects', 'mammary gland tumors', 'exhibit higher level', 'dna damage response', 'lower atr activity', 'increased chromosomal instability', 'cas9 mutation modelling', 'breast tumorigenesis', 'truncated mutation', 'physiological signalling', 'genome instability', 'atr kinase', 'showed phf8', 'whether dysregulation', 'therapeutic indicator', 'targeted therapies', 'study supports', 'specific vulnerability', 'replication stress', 'provides proof', 'promising avenues', 'platinum drug', 'patient survival', 'parp inhibitor', 'mimetic variants', 'master regulators', 'exploited therapeutically', 'concept evidence', 'clinically associated', 'cancer treatment', 'phf8', 'phf8', 'phf8', 'phf8', 'phf8', 'vulnerable', 'together', 'reported', 'pursuit', 'parpis', 'parpi', 'parpi', 'one', 'methylation', 'loss', 'k118me1', 'k118me1', 'involved', 'importantly', 'however', 'function', 'found', 'drive', 'disruption', 'deleted', 'defects', 'ddr', 'ddr', 'crispr', 'creates', 'activation']"
"Cancer arises from genetic alterations that invariably contribute to dysregulated transcriptional programs. These dysregulated programs establish and maintain specific cancer cell states, leading to an intensive dependence on a set of certain regulators of gene expression. The CDK7 functions as the core of transcription, and governs RNA polymerase II and the downstream oncogenes expression in cancers. CDK7 Inhibition leads to reduced recruitment of super-enhancers-driven oncogenic transcription factors, and the depression of these associated oncogenes expression, which indicates the dependence of transcriptional addiction of cancers on CDK7. Given that specified oncoproteins of sarcomas commonly function at oncogenic transcription, targeting CDK7-denpendent transcriptional addiction may be of guiding significance for the treatment of sarcomas. In this review, we summarize the advances in mechanism of targeted CDK7-dependent transcriptional addiction and discuss the path ahead to potential application discovery in bone and soft tissue sarcomas, providing theoretical considerations for bio-orthogonal therapeutic strategies.","['maintain specific cancer cell states', 'governs rna polymerase ii', 'denpendent transcriptional addiction may', 'driven oncogenic transcription factors', 'providing theoretical considerations', 'potential application discovery', 'orthogonal therapeutic strategies', 'dysregulated transcriptional programs', 'dysregulated programs establish', 'dependent transcriptional addiction', 'downstream oncogenes expression', 'associated oncogenes expression', 'soft tissue sarcomas', 'sarcomas commonly function', 'cdk7 inhibition leads', 'transcriptional addiction', 'cancer arises', 'oncogenic transcription', 'gene expression', 'targeting cdk7', 'targeted cdk7', 'specified oncoproteins', 'reduced recruitment', 'path ahead', 'invariably contribute', 'guiding significance', 'genetic alterations', 'certain regulators', 'cdk7 functions', 'intensive dependence', 'transcription', 'sarcomas', 'cdk7', 'dependence', 'treatment', 'super', 'summarize', 'set', 'review', 'mechanism', 'leading', 'indicates', 'given', 'enhancers', 'discuss', 'depression', 'core', 'cancers', 'cancers', 'bone', 'bio', 'advances']"
"Cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted therapies help people with advanced cancers, but for most, treatment fails. Cancer heterogeneity is one cause of treatment failure, but also suggests an opportunity to improve outcomes; reconceptualising cancer therapy as an ecological problem offers the strategy of adaptive therapy. If an agent is active against a patient's cancer, instead of traditional continuous dosing at the maximum tolerated dose until treatment failure, the patient and their oncologist may instead choose to pause treatment as soon as the cancer responds. When tumour burden increases, the cancer is rechallenged with the same agent in hope of delivering another response, ideally before symptoms occur or quality-of-life is impacted. These 'loops' of 'pause/restart' allows an active treatment to be used strategically, to delay the development of evolutionary selection within the cancer, delaying the onset of treatment resistance, controlling the cancer for longer. Modelling predicts patients can navigate several 'loops', potentially increasing the utility of an active treatment by multiples, and early trials suggest at least doubling of progression-free survival. In this narrative review we confront how cancer heterogeneity limits treatment effectiveness, re-examine cancer as an ecological problem, review the data supporting adaptive therapy and outline the challenges and opportunities faced in clinical practice to implement this evolutionary concept. In an era where multiple novel active anti-neoplastic agents are being used with ancient inflexibile maximum tolerated dose for maximum duration approaches, adaptive dosing offers a personalised, n = 1 approach to cancer therapy selection.","['ancient inflexibile maximum tolerated dose', 'cancer heterogeneity limits treatment effectiveness', 'targeted therapies help people', 'oncologist may instead choose', ""loops ', potentially increasing"", 'multiple novel active anti', 'data supporting adaptive therapy', 'maximum tolerated dose', 'maximum duration approaches', 'tumour burden increases', 'traditional continuous dosing', 'modelling predicts patients', 'early trials suggest', 'delivering another response', 'adaptive dosing offers', 'evolutionary selection within', 'reconceptualising cancer therapy', 'cancer therapy selection', 'ecological problem offers', 'adaptive therapy', 'cancer heterogeneity', 'ecological problem', 'active treatment', 'active treatment', 'evolutionary concept', 'treatment resistance', 'treatment failure', 'treatment failure', 'treatment fails', 'examine cancer', 'cancer responds', 'symptoms occur', 'opportunities faced', 'one cause', 'neoplastic agents', 'navigate several', 'least doubling', 'improve outcomes', 'free survival', 'cytotoxic chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'also suggests', 'advanced cancers', '1 approach', 'pause treatment', 'used strategically', 'narrative review', 'loops', 'instead', 'active', 'cancer', 'cancer', 'cancer', 'cancer', 'used', 'review', 'pause', 'utility', 'strategy', 'soon', 'restart', 'rechallenged', 'quality', 'progression', 'personalised', 'patient', 'patient', 'outline', 'opportunity', 'onset', 'n', 'multiples', 'longer', 'life', 'implement', 'impacted', 'ideally', 'hope', 'era', 'development', 'delaying', 'delay', 'controlling', 'confront', 'challenges', 'allows', 'agent', 'agent']"
"Noninvasive photothermal therapy (PTT) represents a promising direction for more modern and precise medical applications. However, PTT efficacy is still not satisfactory due to the existence of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and poorly targeted delivery. Herein, the design of a nanosystem with improved delivery efficacy for anticancer treatment employing the synergetic effects of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-driven chemodynamic therapy (CDT) to inactivated HSPs with photothermal-hyperthermia was therefore achieved through the development of pH-targeting glycol chitosan/iron oxide enclosed core polypyrrole nanoclusters (GCPI NCs). The designed NCs effectively accumulated toward cancer cells due to their acidic microenvironment, initiating ROS generation via Fenton reaction at the outset and performing site-specific near infrared (NIR)-photothermal effect. A comprehensive analysis of both surface and bulk material properties of the CDT/PTT NCs as well as biointerface properties were ascertained via numerous surface specific analytical techniques by bringing together heightened accumulation of CDT/PTT NCs, which can significantly eradicate cancer cells thus minimizing the side effects of conventional chemotherapies. All of these attributes act in synergy over the cancer cells succeeding in fashioning NC's able to act as competent agents in the MRI-monitored enhanced CDT/PTT synergistic therapy. Findings in this study evoke attention in future oncological therapeutic strategies.","['designed ncs effectively accumulated toward cancer cells due', 'ascertained via numerous surface specific analytical techniques', 'iron oxide enclosed core polypyrrole nanoclusters', 'initiating ros generation via fenton reaction', 'significantly eradicate cancer cells thus minimizing', 'ros )- driven chemodynamic therapy', 'future oncological therapeutic strategies', 'bringing together heightened accumulation', 'nir )- photothermal effect', 'cancer cells succeeding', 'specific near infrared', 'gcpi ncs ).', 'noninvasive photothermal therapy', 'targeting glycol chitosan', 'study evoke attention', 'reactive oxygen species', 'precise medical applications', 'poorly targeted delivery', 'heat shock proteins', 'anticancer treatment employing', 'ptt synergistic therapy', 'improved delivery efficacy', 'bulk material properties', 'monitored enhanced cdt', 'satisfactory due', 'ptt ncs', 'ptt ncs', 'ptt efficacy', 'biointerface properties', 'therefore achieved', 'synergetic effects', 'surface', 'side effects', 'promising direction', 'performing site', 'fashioning nc', 'conventional chemotherapies', 'comprehensive analysis', 'competent agents', 'acidic microenvironment', 'inactivated hsps', 'attributes act', 'photothermal', 'ptt', 'hsps', 'cdt', 'cdt', 'cdt', 'act', 'well', 'synergy', 'still', 'represents', 'ph', 'outset', 'nanosystem', 'mri', 'modern', 'hyperthermia', 'however', 'herein', 'findings', 'existence', 'development', 'design', 'able']"
"Chronic hepatitis D is the most severe form of chronic viral hepatitis and to date, efficient therapeutic approaches against hepatitis D virus (HDV) are limited. Among the antiviral molecules currently tested in clinical trials, the farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI) Lonafarnib inhibits the prenylation of the large delta antigen (L-HDAg), blocking virus assembly. Given the importance of L-HDAg in the virus life cycle, we hypothesized that Lonafarnib treatment may have side effects on virus replication. Here, we setup an innovative method for the quantification of HDV RNA allowing the independent quantification of edited and non-edited versions of the HDV genome upon infection. We demonstrated that FTI treatment of HBV/HDV co-infected dHepaRG or primary human hepatocytes leads to an accumulation of intracellular HDV RNAs and a marked increase in the levels of edited RNAs non only within the infected cells but also in the viral particles that are produced. Interestingly, these viral particles were less infectious, probably due to an enrichment in edited genomes that are packaged, leading to unproductive infection given the absence of S-HDAg synthesis after viral entry. Taken together, we setup an innovative quantification method allowing the investigation of RNA editing during HDV infection in a simple, fast, clinically-relevant assay and demonstrated for the first time the dual antiviral activity of FTI on HDV infection.","['hdag ), blocking virus assembly', 'primary human hepatocytes leads', 'antiviral molecules currently tested', 'hdv genome upon infection', 'innovative quantification method allowing', 'dual antiviral activity', 'large delta antigen', 'farnesyl transferase inhibitor', 'efficient therapeutic approaches', 'virus life cycle', 'intracellular hdv rnas', 'hdv rna allowing', 'lonafarnib treatment may', 'unproductive infection given', 'edited rnas non', 'chronic viral hepatitis', 'innovative method', 'hdv infection', 'hdv infection', 'virus replication', 'hdag synthesis', 'rna editing', 'lonafarnib inhibits', 'chronic hepatitis', 'hdv co', 'independent quantification', 'viral particles', 'viral particles', 'viral entry', 'taken together', 'side effects', 'severe form', 'relevant assay', 'probably due', 'marked increase', 'less infectious', 'infected dheparg', 'infected cells', 'first time', 'edited versions', 'edited genomes', 'clinical trials', 'fti treatment', 'virus', 'hdag', 'hdv', 'quantification', 'non', 'hepatitis', 'given', 'edited', 'fti', 'fti', 'within', 'simple', 'setup', 'setup', 'produced', 'prenylation', 'packaged', 'limited', 'levels', 'leading', 'l', 'l', 'investigation', 'interestingly', 'importance', 'hypothesized', 'hbv', 'fast', 'enrichment', 'demonstrated', 'demonstrated', 'date', 'clinically', 'among', 'also', 'accumulation', 'absence']"
"Hearing loss is the most prevalent sensory deficit globally, and its prevalence has been growing at a rapid pace, mainly due to the aging population. Although there is plentiful evidence that exposure to air pollutants contributes to oxidative stress and free radical formation in the inner ear is linked to hearing impairment, there is little awareness of the contribution of air pollution to hearing loss.

Two lentiviral vectors, one encoding an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter cassette and the other a repressor cassette, were sequentially transduced into Jurkat cells, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to isolate stable Jurkat progeny. As a result, EGFP expression was repressed by MarR and was inducible upon the addition of SA (~1.3 fold).

For this meta-analysis, we performed a systematic literature search in MEDLINE, Embase, trial registries, the Web of Science, Scopus, and conference proceedings to identify trials with results published in English between Jan 1, 1962, and Dec 30, 2020. Multicentre randomised trials were eligible if they evaluated the use or prolongation of ADT (or both) in men with localised prostate cancer receiving definitive radiotherapy, reported or collected distant metastasis and survival data, and used ADT for a protocol-defined finite duration. The Meta-Analysis of Randomized trials in Cancer of the Prostate (MARCAP) Consortium was accessed to obtain individual patient data from randomised trials. The primary outcome was metastasis-free survival. Hazard ratios (HRs) were obtained through stratified Cox models for ADT use (radiotherapy alone vs radiotherapy plus ADT), neoadjuvant ADT extension (ie, extension of total ADT duration in the neoadjuvant setting from 3-4 months to 6-9 months), and adjuvant ADT prolongation (ie, prolongation of total ADT duration in the adjuvant setting from 4-6 months to 18-36 months). Formal interaction tests between interventions and metastasis-free survival were done for prespecified subgroups defined by age, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) risk group, and radiotherapy dose. This meta-analysis is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021236855.
Our search returned 12 eligible trials that provided individual patient data (10 853 patients) with a median follow-up of 11·4 years (IQR 9·0-15·0). The addition of ADT to radiotherapy significantly improved metastasis-free survival (HR 0·83 [95% CI 0·77-0·89], p<0·0001), as did adjuvant ADT prolongation (0·84 [0·78-0·91], p<0·0001), but neoadjuvant ADT extension did not (0·95 [0·83-1·09], p=0·50). Treatment effects were similar irrespective of radiotherapy dose, patient age, or NCCN risk group.
Our findings provide the strongest level of evidence so far to the magnitude of the benefit of ADT treatment intensification with radiotherapy for men with localised prostate cancer. Adding ADT and prolonging the portion of ADT that follows radiotherapy is associated with improved metastasis-free survival in men, regardless of risk group, age, and radiotherapy dose delivered; however, the magnitude of the benefit could vary and shared decision making with patients is recommended.

"Extraintestinal manifestations occur frequently in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and remain a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. The aim of the Endpoints for Extraintestinal Manifestations in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Trials (EXTRA) initiative was to achieve international expert consensus on how to assess these manifestations in IBD trials. A systematic literature review was done to identify methods to diagnose extraintestinal manifestations in patients with IBD and measure treatment outcomes. A consensus meeting involving a panel of 41 attendees, including gastroenterologists and referral specialists, was held on March 31, 2021, as part of an International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases initiative. The panel agreed that a specialist's expertise is needed to confirm the diagnosis of extraintestinal manifestations before the inclusion of a patient in IBD trials, except for axial spondyloarthritis, for which typical symptoms and MRI can be sufficient. Easy-to-measure endpoints were identified to assess the response of extraintestinal manifestations to treatment without needing specialist involvement. For uveitis, peripheral spondyloarthritis, and arthralgia, endpoint measurements need specialist expertise. The timing of endpoint measurements was discussed for individual extraintestinal manifestations. The EXTRA consensus proposes guidelines on how to thoroughly evaluate extraintestinal manifestations within IBD trials, and recommends that these guidelines are implemented in future trials to enable prospective assessment of these manifestations and comparison between studies.","['thoroughly evaluate extraintestinal manifestations within ibd trials', 'treatment without needing specialist involvement', 'endpoint measurements need specialist expertise', 'achieve international expert consensus', 'inflammatory bowel disease trials', 'extraintestinal manifestations occur frequently', 'inflammatory bowel diseases initiative', 'extra consensus proposes guidelines', 'inflammatory bowel disease', 'consensus meeting involving', 'measure treatment outcomes', 'individual extraintestinal manifestations', 'diagnose extraintestinal manifestations', 'systematic literature review', 'enable prospective assessment', 'endpoint measurements', 'extraintestinal manifestations', 'extraintestinal manifestations', 'extraintestinal manifestations', 'ibd trials', 'ibd trials', 'future trials', 'international organization', 'typical symptoms', 'therapeutic challenge', 'referral specialists', 'peripheral spondyloarthritis', 'measure endpoints', 'march 31', 'including gastroenterologists', 'identify methods', 'axial spondyloarthritis', '41 attendees', 'specialist', 'panel agreed', 'expertise', 'manifestations', 'manifestations', 'ibd', 'ibd', 'initiative', 'guidelines', 'extra', 'panel', 'endpoints', 'uveitis', 'timing', 'sufficient', 'study', 'studies', 'response', 'remain', 'recommends', 'patients', 'patients', 'patient', 'part', 'needed', 'mri', 'inclusion', 'implemented', 'identified', 'held', 'except', 'easy', 'done', 'discussed', 'diagnostic', 'diagnosis', 'confirm', 'comparison', 'assess', 'assess', 'arthralgia', 'aim', '2021']"
"To improve health knowledge, facilitate healthy behaviors, and provide social support for a high-risk population of women by implementing a culturally tailored, gender-specific lifestyle intervention program.
Evidence-based practice project.
A Chicago neighborhood in Cook County, Illinois, where there are increased rates of diabetes, heart disease, cancer, stroke, hypertension, obesity, preterm birth, and violent crime.
Female residents of the community, ages 19 to 45 years; 12 participants registered for the program, and 11 participants completed the entire 2-month program.
The BE WISE Lifestyle Intervention, a culturally tailored, gender-specific behavior change curriculum, was used for this project. An interprofessional team was used to enhance participant experience, and neighborhood collaborations were established to create sustainability of efforts. Pre- and postintervention measures of diet, physical activity, social support, and knowledge acquisition were used to evaluate outcomes.
Improvement was noted for knowledge in most of the content areas, as well as for dietary and physical activity behaviors. All participants rated the program highly and responded positively to the social support experienced in the group.
Culturally tailored lifestyle interventions can be effective in improving knowledge and encouraging behavior change, especially when delivered in group settings to enhance social support. Community-level collaborations enhance interventions by providing local support and resources for participants. Because behavior change takes time, follow-up at the 6-month and 1-year intervals is recommended to determine longer-term outcomes.","['specific behavior change curriculum', 'behavior change takes time', 'level collaborations enhance interventions', 'specific lifestyle intervention program', 'culturally tailored lifestyle interventions', 'encouraging behavior change', 'wise lifestyle intervention', 'enhance participant experience', 'facilitate healthy behaviors', 'enhance social support', 'providing local support', 'social support experienced', 'provide social support', '12 participants registered', '11 participants completed', 'physical activity behaviors', 'improve health knowledge', 'based practice project', 'social support', 'culturally tailored', 'culturally tailored', 'physical activity', 'neighborhood collaborations', 'program highly', 'participants rated', 'year intervals', 'violent crime', 'term outcomes', 'risk population', 'responded positively', 'preterm birth', 'postintervention measures', 'knowledge acquisition', 'interprofessional team', 'increased rates', 'improving knowledge', 'heart disease', 'female residents', 'evaluate outcomes', 'entire 2', 'determine longer', 'create sustainability', 'cook county', 'content areas', 'chicago neighborhood', 'ages 19', '45 years', 'month program', 'group settings', 'program', 'participants', 'project', 'knowledge', 'month', 'group', 'women', 'well', 'used', 'used', 'used', 'stroke', 'resources', 'recommended', 'pre', 'obesity', 'noted', 'improvement', 'implementing', 'illinois', 'hypertension', 'high', 'gender', 'gender', 'follow', 'evidence', 'established', 'especially', 'efforts', 'effective', 'dietary', 'diet', 'diabetes', 'delivered', 'community', 'community', 'cancer', '6', '1']"

"Nuclear deubiquitinase BAP1 (BRCA1-associated protein 1) is a core component of multiprotein complexes that promote transcription by reversing the ubiquitination of histone 2A (H2A). BAP1 is a tumor suppressor whose germline loss-of-function variants predispose to cancer. To our knowledge, there are very rare examples of different germline variants in the same gene causing either a neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) or a tumor predisposition syndrome. Here, we report a series of 11 de novo germline heterozygous missense BAP1 variants associated with a rare syndromic NDD. Functional analysis showed that most of the variants cannot rescue the consequences of BAP1 inactivation, suggesting a loss-of-function mechanism. In T cells isolated from two affected children, H2A deubiquitination was impaired. In matching peripheral blood mononuclear cells, histone H3 K27 acetylation ChIP-seq indicated that these BAP1 variants induced genome-wide chromatin state alterations, with enrichment for regulatory regions surrounding genes of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Altogether, these results define a clinical syndrome caused by rare germline missense BAP1 variants that alter chromatin remodeling through abnormal histone ubiquitination and lead to transcriptional dysregulation of developmental genes.","['11 de novo germline heterozygous missense bap1 variants associated', 'rare germline missense bap1 variants', 'matching peripheral blood mononuclear cells', 'histone h3 k27 acetylation chip', 'tumor suppressor whose germline loss', 'bap1 variants induced genome', 'wide chromatin state alterations', 'regulatory regions surrounding genes', 'different germline variants', 'associated protein 1', 'variants cannot rescue', 'tumor predisposition syndrome', 'nuclear deubiquitinase bap1', 'function variants predispose', 'alter chromatin remodeling', 'two affected children', 'gene causing either', 'functional analysis showed', 'clinical syndrome caused', 'rare syndromic ndd', 'abnormal histone ubiquitination', 'bap1 inactivation', 'cells isolated', 'rare examples', 'histone 2a', 'developmental genes', 'function mechanism', 'ups ).', 'transcriptional dysregulation', 'seq indicated', 'results define', 'proteasome system', 'promote transcription', 'neurodevelopmental disorder', 'multiprotein complexes', 'h2a deubiquitination', 'h2a ).', 'core component', 'bap1', 'loss', 'ubiquitination', 'ndd', 'ubiquitin', 'suggesting', 'series', 'reversing', 'report', 'lead', 'knowledge', 'impaired', 'enrichment', 'consequences', 'cancer', 'brca1', 'altogether']"

"The Research to Accelerate Cures and Equity (RACE) for Children Act of 2017 authorized the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to require pediatric clinical trials for new oncology drugs with relevant molecular targets. This study reviewed oncology drug approvals within the first year after the new legislation came into effect, to evaluate the impact on development of molecularly targeted oncology drugs for pediatric cancers.
For new oncology drugs approved by the FDA between 08/18/2020-08/18/2021, drug approval packages, letters and prescribing information were reviewed for the submission and approval dates, indication and molecular target of the drug, and post-marketing requirements that included pediatric clinical trials.
Within the 1-year period, 17 new oncology drugs were approved, but only 5 had been submitted after 08/18/2020. Three of the 5 (60.0%) had requirements for pediatric trials under the RACE Act. None of the 12 submitted prior to 08/18/2020 had pediatric trial requirements, but 11 (91.7%) had molecular targets that would have made them candidates under the RACE Act. Nine of the 17 approvals (52.9%) had pediatric trials registered on clinicaltrials.gov.

"Immunotherapy has established a new paradigm for cancer treatment and made many breakthroughs in clinical practice. However, the rarity of immune response suggests that additional intervention is necessary.

Thus, the combination of immunotherapy and LTD methods will be a promising approach to improve immune efficiency for cancer treatment. Herein, a nanobiotechnology platform to achieve high-precision LTD for systemic cancer immunotherapy has been successfully constructed. Possessing radio-sensitizing and photothermal properties, the engineered immunoadjuvant-loaded nanoplatform, which could precisely induce radiotherapy (RT)/photothermal therapy (PTT) to eliminate local tumor and meanwhile lead to the release of tumor-derived protein antigens (TDPAs), has been facilely fabricated by commercialized SPG membrane emulsification technology.

"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has a relatively poor prognosis. Research has identified potential metabolic targets, including fatty acid metabolism, in TNBC. The absence of effective target therapies for TNBC led to exploration of the role of fatty acid synthetase (FASN) as a potential target for TNBC therapy. Here, we analyzed the expression of FASN, a representative lipid metabolism-related protein, and investigated the association between FASN expression and Ki-67 and the programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) biomarkers in TNBC.
Immunohistochemical expression of FASN was analyzed in 166 patients with TNBC. For analytical purposes, patients with 0-1+ FASN staining were grouped as low-grade FASN and patients with 2+-3+ FASN staining as high-grade FASN.
FASN expression was observed in 47.1% of TNBC patients. Low and high expression of FASN was identified in 75.9% and 24.1%, respectively, and no statistically significant difference was found in T category, N category, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, or recurrence rate between the low and high-FASN expression groups. Ki-67 proliferation level was significantly different between the low and high-FASN expression groups. FASN expression was significantly related to Ki-67 as the level increased. There was no significant difference in PD-L1 positivity between the low- and high-FASN expression groups.
We identified FASN expression in 166 TNBC patients. The Ki-67 proliferation index was positively correlated with FASN level, indicating higher proliferation activity as FASN increases.

We report a case of a 26-year-old female who presented with low back pain and constipation which persisted despite supportive measures. Imaging revealed multiple liver lesions and enlarged retroperitoneal nodes. Tumor markers including AFP were markedly elevated. On biopsy, samples from the liver revealed infiltrating glands lined by columnar-type epithelium with mostly eosinophilic granular to focally clear cytoplasm. By immunohistochemistry, the tumor showed immunoreactivity with AFP, hepatocyte antigen, GPC3, SALL4, CDX2, SATB2, and cytokeratin 20. A colonoscopy performed subsequently revealed a mass in the sigmoid colon and biopsy of this mass revealed a similar histology as that seen in the liver. A diagnosis of CAED was made, following the results of gene expression profiling by the tumor with next-generation sequencing which identified pathogenic variants in MUTYH, TP53, and KDM6A genes and therefore supported its colonic origin. Cases such as this underscores the use of ancillary diagnostic techniques in arriving at the correct diagnosis in lesions with overlapping clinicopathologic characteristics.","['least one enteroblastic marker including afp', 'spalt like transcription factor 4', 'liver revealed infiltrating glands lined', 'imaging revealed multiple liver lesions', 'persisted despite supportive measures', 'colonoscopy performed subsequently revealed', 'tumor markers including afp', 'overlapping clinicopathologic characteristics', 'mostly eosinophilic granular', 'low back pain', 'identified pathogenic variants', 'focally clear cytoplasm', 'enlarged retroperitoneal nodes', 'ancillary diagnostic techniques', 'tumor showed immunoreactivity', 'gene expression profiling', 'colonic adenocarcinoma characterized', 'enteroblastic differentiation', 'mass revealed', 'colorectal adenocarcinoma', 'colonic origin', 'type epithelium', 'therefore supported', 'similar histology', 'sigmoid colon', 'rare subtype', 'old female', 'markedly elevated', 'kdm6a genes', 'increased α', 'hepatocyte antigen', 'glypican 3', 'generation sequencing', 'cytokeratin 20', 'liver', 'sall4 ).', 'gpc3 ),', 'correct diagnosis', 'lesions', 'afp', 'afp', 'tumor', 'expression', 'sall4', 'mass', 'gpc3', 'diagnosis', 'year', 'use', 'underscores', 'tp53', 'seen', 'satb2', 'samples', 'results', 'report', 'production', 'presented', 'next', 'mutyh', 'made', 'immunohistochemistry', 'following', 'fetoprotein', 'constipation', 'columnar', 'cdx2', 'cases', 'case', 'caed', 'caed', 'biopsy', 'biopsy', 'arriving', '26']"

Herein, we describe a case of malignant SFT that presented as a recurrent mass on the scalp.

Re-examination of the previously examined specimen was considered.

"Recurrence is the major cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) death. We aimed to identify circular RNA (circRNA) with predictive and therapeutic value for recurrent HCC.
Tissue samples from recurrent and non-recurrent HCC patients were subjected to circRNA sequencing and transcriptome sequencing. circKCNN2 was identified through multi-omics analyses. The effects of circKCNN2 on HCC were evaluated in cells, animals, database of The Cancer Genome Atlas, and a cohort with 130 HCC patients. circRNA precipitation, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, RNA pull-down, luciferase assay, and cell experiments were applied to evaluate the interaction of circKCNN2 with miRNAs and proteins. The association between circKCNN2 and the therapeutic effect of lenvatinib was investigated in HCC cell lines and HCC tissue-derived organoids.
The expression of circKCNN2 was downregulated in HCC tissues and predicted a favorable overall survival and recurrence-free survival. The expression of circKCNN2 was positively correlated with the parental gene, potassium calcium-activated channel subfamily N member (KCNN2). Nuclear transcription factor Y subunit alpha (NFYA) was proven to inhibit the promoter activity of KCNN2, downregulate the expression of KCNN2 and circKCNN2, and predict an unfavorable recurrence-free survival. Ectopic expression of circKCNN2 inhibited HCC cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and tumor formation in a mouse model. miR-520c-3p sponged by circKCNN2 could reverse the inhibitory effect of circKCNN2 on HCC cells and down-regulate the expression of methyl-DNA-binding domain protein 2 (MBD2). The intratumoral expression of MBD2 predicted a favorable recurrence-free survival. circKCNN2 down-regulated the expression of fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4), which can be reversed by miR-520c-3p and knockdown of MBD2. Lenvatinib inhibited the expression of FGFR4 and upregulated the expression of circKCNN2 and MBD2. Ectopic expression of circKCNN2 in HCC cells enhanced the therapeutic effect of lenvatinib. However, the high inherent level of circKCNN2 in HCC cells was associated with lenvatinib resistance.
circKCNN2, transcriptionally repressed by NFYA, suppresses HCC recurrence via the miR-520c-3p/MBD2 axis. Inherent level of circKCNN2 in HCC cells predisposes anti-tumor effect of lenvatinib possibly because both circKCNN2 and lenvatinib repress the expression of FGFR4. circKCNN2 may be a promising predictive biomarker and therapeutic agent for HCC recurrence.","['activated channel subfamily n member', 'fibroblast growth factor receptor 4', 'binding domain protein 2', 'circkcnn2 inhibited hcc cell proliferation', 'hcc cells predisposes anti', 'suppresses hcc recurrence via', 'nuclear transcription factor', 'cancer genome atlas', 'hcc cell lines', '130 hcc patients', 'identify circular rna', 'chromatin immunoprecipitation assay', 'promising predictive biomarker', 'high inherent level', 'hcc cells enhanced', 'favorable overall survival', 'recurrent hcc patients', 'circkcnn2 could reverse', 'cell experiments', 'lenvatinib inhibited', 'inherent level', 'hcc cells', 'hcc cells', 'recurrent hcc', 'hcc tissues', 'hcc tissue', 'hcc recurrence', 'rna pull', 'luciferase assay', 'favorable recurrence', 'free survival', 'free survival', 'free survival', 'unfavorable recurrence', 'tumor formation', 'tumor effect', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptionally repressed', 'tissue samples', 'therapeutic value', 'therapeutic effect', 'therapeutic effect', 'therapeutic agent', 'subunit alpha', 'promoter activity', 'potassium calcium', 'positively correlated', 'parental gene', 'omics analyses', 'mouse model', 'major cause', 'inhibitory effect', 'hepatocellular carcinoma', 'derived organoids', 'colony formation', 'lenvatinib resistance', 'lenvatinib repress', 'lenvatinib possibly', 'circrna sequencing', 'circrna precipitation', 'mbd2 axis', 'mbd2 ).', 'circkcnn2 may', 'kcnn2 ).', 'fgfr4 ),', '3p sponged', 'intratumoral expression', 'ectopic expression', 'ectopic expression', 'mbd2 predicted', 'hcc', 'hcc', 'cells', 'recurrent', 'recurrence', 'recurrence', 'predictive', 'lenvatinib', 'lenvatinib', 'circrna', 'mbd2', 'mbd2', 'predicted', 'circkcnn2', 'circkcnn2', 'circkcnn2', 'circkcnn2', 'circkcnn2', 'circkcnn2', 'circkcnn2', 'circkcnn2', 'circkcnn2', 'circkcnn2', 'circkcnn2', 'circkcnn2', 'circkcnn2', 'circkcnn2', 'circkcnn2', 'kcnn2', 'kcnn2', 'fgfr4', 'fgfr4', '3p', '3p', 'expression', 'expression', 'expression', 'expression', 'expression', 'expression', 'expression', 'expression', 'upregulated', 'subjected', 'reversed', 'regulated', 'regulate', 'proven', 'proteins', 'predict', 'non', 'nfya', 'nfya', 'multi', 'mirnas', 'mir', 'mir', 'mir', 'migration', 'methyl', 'knockdown', 'investigated', 'interaction', 'inhibit', 'identified', 'however', 'evaluated', 'evaluate', 'effects', 'downregulated', 'downregulate', 'dna', 'death', 'database', 'cohort', 'association', 'associated', 'applied', 'animals', 'aimed', '520c', '520c', '520c']"
"Post-radiotherapy recurrence and metastasis of liver cancer were thought to arise from the invasion and metastasis of residual hepatocellular carcinoma cells, but it has now been shown to be closely related to the increased metastatic potential of residual liver cancer cells mediated by radiotherapy. The changes of liver microenvironment after radiotherapy also provide a favorable condition for promoting the metastatic potential of hepatocellular carcinoma. Studies have shown that radiation-induced activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) is one of the main changes in the microenvironment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, we hypothesized that activated HSCs are involved in regulating the metastatic capacity of residual cancer cells after radiotherapy. The present study observed that 48 h co-culture of three human hepatoma cell lines (MHCC97-L, Hep-3B, LM3) with a irradiated human HSC line (LX-2) in a transwell chamber could significantly improve the invasion of the human hepatoma cells; and the culture supernatant of activated HSCs could also enhance the invasion of the hepatoma cells. In contrast, co-culture with irradiated hepatoma cells enhanced the invasion of LX-2 cells. In vitro, irradiation enhanced the activation phenotype and the toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling pathway of LX-2 cells or primary mouse HSCs, which upregulated intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1), laminin receptor (67 LR), Interleukin- 6 (IL-6), and CX3C chemokine ligand 1 (CX3CL1) and downregulated toll-interacting proteins. The compound (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) inhibited signal transduction of activated TLR4 and radiation-induced invasion of LX-2 cells by binding to 67 LR. These observations indicated that the enhancement of the metastatic potential of hepatoma cells after irradiation was relevant to the activation of HSCs, and the activation of TLR4 signaling pathway was involved in this process, which was inhibited by EGCG. Our results will help enhance the therapeutic efficacy of liver cancer stereotactic body radiation therapy to prevent and decrease the risks of post-radiotherapy recurrence and metastasis.","['liver cancer stereotactic body radiation therapy', 'upregulated intercellular cell adhesion molecule', 'transwell chamber could significantly improve', 'three human hepatoma cell lines', 'residual liver cancer cells mediated', 'activated hscs could also enhance', 'irradiated human hsc line', 'icam1 ), laminin receptor', 'toll like receptor 4', 'cx3c chemokine ligand 1', '67 lr ), interleukin', 'irradiated hepatoma cells enhanced', 'residual hepatocellular carcinoma cells', 'residual cancer cells', 'human hepatoma cells', 'present study observed', 'compound (-)- epigallocatechin', 'hepatic stellate cells', 'radiotherapy also provide', 'primary mouse hscs', 'inhibited signal transduction', '48 h co', 'liver cancer', 'increased metastatic potential', 'tlr4 signaling pathway', 'hepatoma cells', 'hepatoma cells', '67 lr', 'help enhance', 'activated hscs', 'hepatocellular carcinoma', 'hepatocellular carcinoma', 'liver microenvironment', 'signaling pathway', 'downregulated toll', 'activated tlr4', '6 ),', '2 cells', '2 cells', '2 cells', 'metastatic potential', 'metastatic potential', 'irradiation enhanced', 'metastatic capacity', 'therapeutic efficacy', 'observations indicated', 'interacting proteins', 'favorable condition', 'closely related', 'radiotherapy recurrence', 'radiotherapy recurrence', 'main changes', 'induced activation', 'activation phenotype', 'culture supernatant', 'induced invasion', 'radiation', 'radiation', '1', 'hscs', 'hscs', 'tlr4', 'inhibited', 'co', 'radiotherapy', 'radiotherapy', '2', 'microenvironment', 'irradiation', 'changes', 'activation', 'activation', '6', 'culture', 'culture', 'invasion', 'invasion', 'invasion', 'invasion', 'vitro', 'thought', 'therefore', 'studies', 'shown', 'shown', 'risks', 'results', 'relevant', 'regulating', 'promoting', 'process', 'prevent', 'post', 'post', 'one', 'mhcc97', 'metastasis', 'metastasis', 'metastasis', 'lx', 'lx', 'lx', 'lx', 'lm3', 'l', 'involved', 'involved', 'il', 'hypothesized', 'hep', 'gallate', 'enhancement', 'egcg', 'egcg', 'decrease', 'cx3cl1', 'contrast', 'binding', 'arise', '3b', '3']"
"Although folate status is associated with cervical carcinogenesis, it is not clear whether folate deficiency is associated with risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) progression and infection with high-risk human-papillomavirus (hrHPV).
To evaluate the associations of RBC and serum folate concentrations with prevalence of CIN grades and hrHPV infection, their interactions with prevalence of CIN grades, and RBC folate with the risk of CIN1 progressing to CIN2.
Using data from the Shanxi CIN cohort of 2304 female Chinese adults, we used logistic-regression model to estimate ORs and prevalence ratios (PRs) of RBC and serum folate concentrations with prevalence of CIN grades and hrHPV infection. Categoric and spline analyses were used to evaluate the dose-response relations. We estimated the association of RBC folate with risk of CIN1 progressing to CIN2 in the nested case-control cohort.
An inverse association was observed between increased RBC folate concentration and the odds of all CIN grades [quartile 1 (Q1) compared with Q4: OR: 2.28; 95% CI: 1.77, 2.93; Ptrend < 0.001]. Significant interaction of RBC folate and hrHPV infection was observed for prevalence of CIN2 or above (Pinteraction < 0.01). No associations were found between RBC and serum folate with PRs of hrHPV in each CIN grade. Over a median follow-up of 21.0 mo, RBC folate was associated with increased risk of CIN1 progressing to CIN2 (Q1 compared with Q4: OR: 3.86; 95% CI: 1.01, 14.76).
Our study indicates that RBC folate concentration is associated with prevalence of CIN grades and CIN1 progression in female Chinese adults. Maintenance of normal folate status is important for reducing the risk of CIN and its progression in women with or without hrHPV infection.","['clear whether folate deficiency', '2304 female chinese adults', 'increased rbc folate concentration', 'female chinese adults', 'normal folate status', 'although folate status', 'cervical intraepithelial neoplasia', 'serum folate concentrations', 'serum folate concentrations', 'rbc folate concentration', 'shanxi cin cohort', 'without hrhpv infection', 'serum folate', 'rbc folate', 'rbc folate', 'rbc folate', 'rbc folate', 'control cohort', 'cervical carcinogenesis', 'increased risk', 'using data', 'study indicates', 'spline analyses', 'significant interaction', 'response relations', 'regression model', 'nested case', 'median follow', 'hrhpv infection', 'hrhpv infection', 'hrhpv infection', 'hrhpv ).', 'estimate ors', 'cin1 progressing', 'cin1 progressing', 'cin1 progressing', '76 ).', '001 ].', 'cin grades', 'cin grades', 'cin grades', 'cin grades', 'cin grades', 'cin grade', 'used logistic', 'inverse association', '01 ).', 'risk human', 'quartile 1', 'cin1 progression', '0 mo', 'prevalence ratios', 'q1 compared', 'rbc', 'rbc', 'rbc', 'infection', 'hrhpv', 'cin', 'cin', 'used', 'q1', 'compared', 'association', '01', 'risk', 'risk', 'risk', 'risk', 'progression', 'progression', '1', '1', '0', '0', 'prevalence', 'prevalence', 'prevalence', 'prevalence', 'prevalence', 'women', 'reducing', 'q4', 'q4', 'ptrend', 'prs', 'prs', 'pinteraction', 'papillomavirus', 'odds', 'observed', 'observed', 'maintenance', 'interactions', 'important', 'high', 'found', 'evaluate', 'evaluate', 'estimated', 'dose', 'cin2', 'cin2', 'cin2', 'cin2', 'ci', 'ci', 'categoric', 'associations', 'associations', 'associated', 'associated', 'associated', 'associated', '95', '95', '93', '86', '77', '3', '28', '21', '2', '2', '14']"
"Although it is well known that DNA methylation serves to repress gene expression, precisely how it functions during the process of development remains unclear. Here, we propose that the overall pattern of DNA methylation established in the early embryo serves as a sophisticated mechanism for maintaining a genome-wide network of gene regulatory elements in an inaccessible chromatin structure throughout the body. As development progresses, programmed demethylation in each cell type then provides the specificity for maintaining select elements in an open structure. This allows these regulatory elements to interact with a large range of transcription factors and thereby regulate the gene expression profiles that define cell identity.","['inaccessible chromatin structure throughout', 'repress gene expression', 'gene expression profiles', 'early embryo serves', 'dna methylation serves', 'dna methylation established', 'development remains unclear', 'define cell identity', 'gene regulatory elements', 'maintaining select elements', 'regulatory elements', 'open structure', 'development progresses', 'cell type', 'wide network', 'well known', 'transcription factors', 'thereby regulate', 'sophisticated mechanism', 'programmed demethylation', 'overall pattern', 'large range', 'maintaining', 'specificity', 'provides', 'propose', 'process', 'precisely', 'interact', 'genome', 'functions', 'body', 'although', 'allows']"

"The antitumor effects of natural killer cells, helper T cells, and cytotoxic T cells after cancer surgery were reported previously. This study hypothesized that propofol-based anesthesia would have fewer harmful effects on immune cells than volatile anesthetics-based anesthesia during colorectal cancer surgery.
In total, 153 patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery were randomized and included in the analysis. The primary outcome was the fraction of circulating natural killer cells over time in the propofol and sevoflurane groups. The fractions of circulating natural killer, type 1, type 17 helper T cells, and cytotoxic T cells were investigated. The fractions of CD39 and CD73 expressions on circulating regulatory T cells were investigated, along with the proportions of circulating neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes.
The fraction of circulating natural killer cells was not significantly different between the propofol and sevoflurane groups until 24 h postoperatively (20.4 ± 13.4% vs. 20.8 ± 11.3%, 17.9 ± 12.7% vs. 20.7 ± 11.9%, and 18.6 ± 11.6% vs. 21.3 ± 10.8% before anesthesia and after 1 and 24 h after anesthesia, respectively; difference [95% CI], -0.3 [-4.3 to 3.6], -2.8 [-6.8 to 1.1], and -2.6 [-6.2 to 1.0]; P = 0.863, P = 0.136, and P = 0.151 before anesthesia and after 1 and 24 h, respectively). The fractions of circulating type 1 and type 17 helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, and CD39+ and CD73+ circulating regulatory T cells were not significantly different between the two groups.

"CD8+ and CD4+ T cells provide cell-mediated cross-protection against multiple influenza strains by recognising epitopes bound as peptides to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and -II molecules respectively. Two challenges in identifying the immunodominant epitopes needed to generate a universal T cell influenza vaccine are: A lack of cell models susceptible to influenza infection which present population-prevalent HLA allotypes, and an absence of a reliable in-vitro method of identifying class II HLA peptides. Here we present a mass spectrometry-based proteomics strategy for identifying viral peptides derived from the A/H3N2/X31 and A/H3N2/Wisconsin/67/2005 strains of influenza. We compared the HLA-I and -II immunopeptidomes presented by ex-vivo influenza challenged human lung tissues. We then compared these with directly infected immortalised macrophage-like cell line (THP1) and primary dendritic cells fed apoptotic influenza-infected respiratory epithelial cells. In each of the three experimental conditions we identified novel influenza class I and II HLA peptides with motifs specific for the host allotype. Ex-vivo infected lung tissues yielded few class-II HLA peptides despite significant numbers of alveolar macrophages, including directly infected ones, present within the tissues. THP1 cells presented HLA-I viral peptides derived predominantly from internal proteins. Primary dendritic cells presented predominantly viral envelope-derived HLA class II peptides following phagocytosis of apoptotic infected cells. The most frequent viral source protein for HLA-I and -II was matrix 1 protein (M1). This work confirms that internal influenza proteins, particularly M1, are a rich source of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of two ex-vivo fully human infection models which enable direct HLA-I and -II immunopeptide identification without significant viral tropism limitations. Application of this epitope discovery strategy in a clinical setting will provide more certainty in rational vaccine design against influenza and other emergent viruses.","['ii immunopeptide identification without significant viral tropism limitations', 'primary dendritic cells presented predominantly viral envelope', 'derived hla class ii peptides following phagocytosis', 'primary dendritic cells fed apoptotic influenza', 'ii hla peptides despite significant numbers', 'vivo influenza challenged human lung tissues', 'vivo infected lung tissues yielded', 'vivo fully human infection models', 'viral peptides derived predominantly', 'identifying class ii hla peptides', 'identifying viral peptides derived', 'infected respiratory epithelial cells', 'including directly infected ones', 'directly infected immortalised macrophage', 'frequent viral source protein', 'thp1 cells presented hla', 'identified novel influenza class', 'apoptotic infected cells', 'ii hla peptides', 'ii immunopeptidomes presented', 'human leukocyte antigen', 'ii molecules respectively', 'cell models susceptible', 'matrix 1 protein', 'prevalent hla allotypes', 'enable direct hla', 'cells provide cell', 'cell influenza vaccine', 'three experimental conditions', 'rational vaccine design', 'epitope discovery strategy', 'based proteomics strategy', 'like cell line', 'multiple influenza strains', 'recognising epitopes bound', 'immunodominant epitopes needed', 'internal influenza proteins', 'influenza infection', 'cell epitopes', 'rich source', 'internal proteins', 'ii', '2005 strains', 'peptides', 'work confirms', 'vitro method', 'two challenges', 'tissues', 'particularly m1', 'motifs specific', 'mediated cross', 'mass spectrometry', 'm1 ).', 'host allotype', 'emergent viruses', 'clinical setting', 'alveolar macrophages', 'present within', 'present population', 'class', 'class', 'hla', 'hla', 'hla', 'identifying', 'two ex', 'influenza', 'influenza', 'thp1', 'provide', 'present', 'ex', 'ex', 'x31', 'wisconsin', 'utility', 'universal', 'reliable', 'protection', 'moreover', 'lack', 'h3n2', 'h3n2', 'generate', 'demonstrate', 'compared', 'compared', 'certainty', 'cd8', 'cd8', 'cd4', 'cd4', 'application', 'absence', '67']"
"We compared the clinicopathological characteristics and survival outcomes of invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) cases with those of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) cases in various hormone receptor expression subgroups.
We compared clinicopathological characteristics, overall survival (OS), and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) between patients with IDC (n = 95,486) and ILC (n = 3,023). In addition, we analyzed the effects of different hormone receptor expression subgroups on survival.
The ILC group had more instances of advanced stage and hormonal receptor positivity than did the IDC group (p < 0.001), but the IDC group had higher histological grade and nuclear grade, as well as higher frequency of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and Ki67 expression than did the ILC group (p < 0.001). The OS and BCSS were not significantly different between the IDC and ILC groups. The 5-year OS of the IDC group was 88.8%, while that of the ILC group was 90.6% (p = 0.113). The 5-year BCSS of the IDC group was 94.8%, while that of the ILC group was 95.0% (p = 0.552). When analyzing each hormone receptor expression subgroup, there were no significant differences in survival between the IDC and ILC groups. However, the estrogen receptor (ER) negative/progesterone receptor (PR) negative subgroup showed differences in survival between the IDC and ILC groups.

"HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is dominated by clinical therapeutic antiretroviral (ARV) drugs. Griffithsin (GRFT) is a non-ARV lectin with potent anti-HIV activity. GRFT's preclinical safety, lack of systemic absorption after vaginal administration in animal studies, and lack of cross-resistance with existing ARV drugs prompted its development for topical HIV PrEP. We investigated safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and immunogenicity of PC-6500 (0.1% GRFT in a carrageenan (CG) gel) in healthy women after vaginal administration. This randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, double-blind first-in-human phase 1 study enrolled healthy, HIV-negative, non-pregnant women aged 24-45 years. In the open label period, all participants (n = 7) received single dose of PC-6500. In the randomized period, participants (n = 13) were instructed to self-administer 14 doses of PC-6500 or its matching CG placebo (PC-535) once daily for 14 days. The primary outcomes were safety and PK after single dose, and then after 14 days of dosing. Exploratory outcomes were GRFT concentrations in cervicovaginal fluids, PD, inflammatory mediators and gene expression in ectocervical biopsies. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02875119. No significant adverse events were recorded in clinical or laboratory results or histopathological evaluations in cervicovaginal mucosa, and no anti-drug (GRFT) antibodies were detected in serum. No cervicovaginal proinflammatory responses and no changes in the ectocervical transcriptome were evident. Decreased levels of proinflammatory chemokines (CXCL8, CCL5 and CCL20) were observed.

We calculated annualized all-cause and cause-specific mortality rates grouped according to global burden of disease (GBD) categories and separately for deaths due to HIV/AIDS and expressed estimated deaths per 100,000 population. We compared notified to ascertained UCOD using Cohen's Kappa (κ) and assessed for the independence of proportions using Pearson's chi-squared test.
The four leading UCOD were HIV/AIDS (102/442 [23.1%]), hypertensive disease (41/442 [9.3%]), other cardiovascular diseases (23/442 [5.2%]), and cancer (20/442 [4.5%]). The all-cause mortality rate was 1,086/100,000 population. The highest cause-specific mortality was in GBD category II (noncommunicable diseases; 516/100,000), followed by GBD I (communicable, perinatal, maternal, and nutritional; 513/100,000), and III (injuries; 56/100,000). The HIV/AIDS mortality rate was 251/100,000 population. The proportion of deaths due to GBD II causes was higher among females (51.9%) than male decedents (42.1%; p = 0.039). Conversely, more men/boys (8.6%) than women/girls (2.1%) died of GBD III causes (p = 0.002). Most of the records with available recorded and ascertained UCOD (n = 236), 167 (70.8%) had incorrectly recorded UCOD, and agreement between notified and ascertained UCOD was poor (29.2%; κ = 0.26).
Mortality from infectious diseases, especially HIV/AIDS, is high in Kisumu County, but there is a shift toward higher mortality from noncommunicable diseases, possibly reflecting an epidemiologic transition and improving HIV outcomes. The epidemiologic transition suggests the need for increased focus on controlling noncommunicable conditions despite the high communicable disease burden. The weak agreement between notified and ascertained UCOD could lead to substantial inaccuracies in mortality statistics, which wholly depend on death notifications.","['cod certification examined medical charts', 'specific mortality rates grouped according', 'expressed estimated deaths per 100', 'controlling noncommunicable conditions despite', 'shift toward higher mortality', 'two high volume mortuaries', 'ascertained ucod could lead', 'ascertained ucod using cohen', '1 %]), hypertensive disease', 'high communicable disease burden', 'reviewed medical charts', 'medical experts trained', 'proportions using pearson', 'higher among females', '236 ), 167', 'unreliable mortality statistics', 'gbd category ii', 'incorrectly recorded ucod', 'epidemiologic transition suggests', '1 %) died', 'compared ascertained ucod', '000 ), followed', 'unknown hiv status', 'improving hiv outcomes', '456 decedents admitted', '1 %; p', 'gbd ii causes', 'four leading ucod', 'cause mortality rate', 'aids mortality rate', '2 %; κ', 'gbd iii causes', 'specific mortality', 'ascertained ucod', 'ascertained ucod', 'mortality statistics', 'ascertained causes', 'global burden', 'epidemiologic transition', 'deaths due', 'deaths due', '000 ),', 'ascertained systematically', 'noncommunicable diseases', 'noncommunicable diseases', 'establish ucod', '3 %]),', '2 %]),', 'underlying causes', 'available recorded', '6 %)', '000 population', '000 population', '000 population', '000 ).', 'wholly depend', 'substantial inaccuracies', 'squared test', 'possibly reflecting', 'limited settings', 'kisumu county', 'kisumu county', 'july 12', 'infectious diseases', 'increased focus', 'civil registry', 'cardiovascular diseases', 'calculated annualized', 'april 16', '90 days', '26 ).', '039 ).', '002 ).', 'male decedents', 'highest cause', 'especially hiv', 'compared notified', '9 %)', '8 %)', 'weak agreement', '5 %]).', 'tested hiv', 'death notifications', 'high', 'disease', 'mortality', '1', 'ucod', 'mortuaries', 'communicable', 'gbd', 'gbd', 'κ', 'p', 'leading', 'iii', '2', 'hiv', 'hiv', 'hiv', 'hiv', 'decedents', 'decedents', 'cause', 'cause', '100', '100', '100', '100', '100', 'tested', 'aids', 'aids', 'aids', 'agreement', '9', '8', '5', 'notified', 'notified', 'notified', 'death', 'death', 'death', 'women', 'separately', 'resource', 'records', 'proportion', 'poor', 'perinatal', 'often', 'nutritional', 'negative', 'need', 'n', 'men', 'maternal', 'kenya', 'kappa', 'injuries', 'independence', 'girls', 'date', 'conversely', 'chi', 'categories', 'cancer', 'boys', 'assessed', '70', '56', '516', '513', '51', '442', '442', '442', '442', '42', '41', '4', '29', '251', '23', '23', '2019', '20', '102', '086', '0', '0', '0']"
"Lumpectomy is important for preventing malignant changes in benign tumors and diagnosing malignant tumors. Intercostal nerve blocks (ICNBs) are useful for breast lumpectomy as either the primary anesthetic or as an adjuvant anesthetic procedure. To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated the association between Horner syndrome and ICNB.
This study aimed to explore the characteristics of and related risk factors for Horner syndrome after ICNB.
A prospective, nested case-control study.
Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Centre from April 2020 through July 2020.
Patients scheduled for breast lumpectomy under ICNB from April 2020 through July 2020 in our hospital were recruited. The ICNB was introduced at the intersection of the midaxillary line and the inferior border of the ribs, according to the location of the mass. Horner syndrome indicators were assessed one, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes and 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours after ICNB. Personal data (age, body mass index [BMI], ASA classes), data on anesthetic (the puncture points, dose of local anesthetics, duration of ICNB, Horner syndrome indicators, other complications) and data on postoperative recovery (postoperative activity time, postoperative feeding time) were recorded. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals.
Ipsilateral Horner syndrome was found in 35 of 998 (3.5%) patients. Ipsilateral miosis, the first symptom to appear and last to disappear, occurred within 4 minutes and lasted 45 minutes to 240 minutes after ICNB. Seven patients showed obvious ipsilateral facial flushing. Logistic multivariate regression analysis showed that independent risk factors for Horner syndrome after ICNB were age <= 45 years, body mass index <= 18.5 kg/m2, and the need for a second ICNB.
Firstly, the patients in this study are all adult women, and the applicability of other populations is uncertain. Secondly, the flow trajectory of local anesthetics was not confirmed by imaging tracers.
ICNB via an anterolateral approach promoted enhanced recovery after breast lumpectomy. The incidence of Horner syndrome following ICNB for breast lumpectomy was 3.5%. Horner syndrome occurred on the ipsilateral side of the ICNB and was reversible. Younger age, lower BMI, and the need for a second ICNB were risk factors for Horner syndrome after ICNB.

"Elastography is a sonographic technique that provides a noninvasive evaluation of the stiffness of a lesion. The objective of this work was to evaluate the accuracy of strain elastography, the most accessible modality in clinical practice, to discriminate between different histological types of malignant mammary neoplasms in the canine species, which can provide complementary information in real time to the diagnosis and thus help in the choice of surgical technique. A total of 34 females with 56 mammary carcinomas were selected and classified into three histological groups according to their aggressiveness.

"The differences in aerosol composition between new tobacco types (heated tobacco products and electronic cigarettes) and conventional cigarettes have not been systematically studied. In this study, the emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide (CO), nicotine, and tar from heated tobacco products (HTPs), electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and conventional cigarettes were compared, and their health risks were evaluated by applying the same smoking regime and a loss mechanism of smoking. Twenty VOCs were identified in aerosols from HTPs, 18 VOCs were identified in aerosols from e-cigarettes, and 97 VOCs were identified in aerosols from cigarettes by GC-MS and HPLC analysis. The concentrations of total VOCs (TVOCs) emitted by the three types of tobacco products decreased as follows: e-cigarettes (795.4 mg/100 puffs) > cigarettes (83.29 mg/100 puffs) > HTPs (15.65 mg/100 puffs). The nicotine content was 24.63 ± 2.25 mg/100 puffs for e-cigarettes, 22.94 ± 0.03 mg/100 puffs for cigarettes, and 8.817 ± 0.500 mg/100 puffs for HTPs. When using cigarettes of the same brand, the mass concentrations of VOCs, tar, and CO emitted by HTPs were approximately 81.2%, 95.9%, and 97.5%, respectively, lower than the amounts emitted by cigarettes.

"Botulinum Toxin injections into salivary glands (SG) up to a total dose of 100 units IncobotulinumtoxinA (IncoA) represent the treatment of choice for sialorrhea. However, BTX might also protect SG against sialotoxic radioligand cancer therapies. The radioligand Actinium-225-PSMA effectively targets Prostate Cancer (PCa) metastases but inevitably destroys SG due to unintended gland uptake. A preliminary case series with regular-dose IncoA failed to reduce SG PSMA-radioligand uptake. We therefore increased IncoA dosage in combination with transdermal scopolamine until a clinically relevant SG PSMA-radioligand uptake reduction was achieved. Ten consecutive men with metastasized PCa refractory to all other cancer therapies received gradually increasing IncoA dosages as part of a compassionate use PSMA-radioligand-therapy trial. The parotid gland received six and the submandibular gland three injection points under ultrasound control, up to a maximum of 30 units IncoA per injection point. A maximum total dose of 250 units IncoA was applied with up to 170 units per parotid and 80 units per submandibular gland. Treatment was well tolerated and all side-effects were non-serious. The most frequent side-effect was dry mouth of mild severity. No dysphagia, facial weakness, chewing difficulties or systemic side-effects were observed. SG injections with IncoA up to a total dose of 250 units are safe when distributed among several injection-points under ultrasound control by an experienced physician. These preliminary findings lay the basis for future trials including BTX as major component for SG protection in established as well as newly emerging radioligand cancer therapies.","['cancer therapies received gradually increasing incoa dosages', '30 units incoa per injection point', 'psma effectively targets prostate cancer', 'newly emerging radioligand cancer therapies', '80 units per submandibular gland', 'btx might also protect sg', 'submandibular gland three injection points', 'parotid gland received six', 'sialotoxic radioligand cancer therapies', 'distributed among several injection', '170 units per parotid', 'future trials including btx', 'therefore increased incoa dosage', 'inevitably destroys sg due', 'clinically relevant sg psma', 'unintended gland uptake', '250 units incoa', '100 units incobotulinumtoxina', 'reduce sg psma', 'compassionate use psma', 'dose incoa failed', 'ten consecutive men', 'preliminary findings lay', 'preliminary case series', 'radioligand uptake reduction', 'botulinum toxin injections', 'metastasized pca refractory', 'maximum total dose', '250 units', 'sg injections', 'radioligand uptake', 'sg protection', 'total dose', 'total dose', 'radioligand actinium', 'ultrasound control', 'ultrasound control', 'transdermal scopolamine', 'therapy trial', 'salivary glands', 'mild severity', 'major component', 'facial weakness', 'experienced physician', 'dry mouth', 'chewing difficulties', 'systemic side', 'frequent side', 'incoa', 'incoa', 'well tolerated', 'sg', 'points', 'radioligand', 'pca', 'maximum', 'side', 'well', 'treatment', 'treatment', 'sialorrhea', 'serious', 'safe', 'represent', 'regular', 'part', 'observed', 'non', 'metastases', 'however', 'established', 'effects', 'effects', 'effect', 'dysphagia', 'combination', 'choice', 'basis', 'applied', 'achieved', '225']"

"Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are the causative agents of a potentially lethal paralytic disease targeting cholinergic nerve terminals. Multiple BoNT serotypes exist, with types A, B and E being the main cause of human botulism. Their extreme toxicity has been exploited for cosmetic and therapeutic uses to treat a wide range of neuromuscular disorders. Although naturally occurring BoNT types share a common end effect, their activity varies significantly based on the neuronal cell-surface receptors and intracellular SNARE substrates they target. These properties are the result of structural variations that have traditionally been studied using biophysical methods such as X-ray crystallography. Here, we determined the first structures of botulinum neurotoxins using single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy. The maps obtained at 3.6 and 3.7 Å for BoNT/B and /E, respectively, highlight the subtle structural dynamism between domains, and of the binding domain in particular. This study demonstrates how the recent advances made in the field of single-particle electron microscopy can be applied to bacterial toxins of clinical relevance and the botulinum neurotoxin family in particular.","['potentially lethal paralytic disease targeting cholinergic nerve terminals', 'although naturally occurring bont types share', 'studied using biophysical methods', 'activity varies significantly based', 'multiple bont serotypes exist', 'particle cryogenic electron microscopy', 'botulinum neurotoxins using single', 'particle electron microscopy', 'recent advances made', 'intracellular snare substrates', 'common end effect', 'botulinum neurotoxin family', 'subtle structural dynamism', 'botulinum neurotoxins', 'structural variations', 'wide range', 'therapeutic uses', 'surface receptors', 'study demonstrates', 'ray crystallography', 'neuronal cell', 'neuromuscular disorders', 'maps obtained', 'main cause', 'human botulism', 'first structures', 'extreme toxicity', 'clinical relevance', 'causative agents', 'binding domain', 'bacterial toxins', '7 å', 'bont', 'types', 'single', 'x', 'treat', 'traditionally', 'target', 'result', 'respectively', 'properties', 'particular', 'particular', 'highlight', 'field', 'exploited', 'e', 'e', 'domains', 'determined', 'cosmetic', 'bonts', 'b', 'b', 'applied', '6', '3', '3']"

So far, its anti-diabetic effects are poorly explored. We tried to assess AITC action on carbohydrate, lipid and hormonal disorders in high fat diet-fed/streptozotocin diabetic rats. In this report, diabetic rats were treated intragastrically at doses 2.5, 5 and 25 mg/kg b.w./day of AITC for 2 weeks. Irrespectively of doses, AITC considerably lowered thyroid hormones (fT4, fT3), increased liver TG content, and also caused robust LDL-cholesterol and direct bilirubin concentration enhancement. Moreover, AITC at the highest dose caused pancreatic amylase and lipase drops and thyroid gland hypertrophy. AITC at 2.5 and 5 mg significantly reduced blood glucose levels along with robust beta-hydroxybutyric acid drop. Additionally, AITC at 5 mg improved insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR index) in spite of reduced blood insulin.

"Sun exposure is a risk factor for skin cancer. Knowledge and behaviors around sun exposure protective measures are poorly described in athletes including runners. Our primary objective was to describe sun exposure behaviors and knowledge in a population of runners. A cross-sectional online survey was administered to 697 runners to measure the frequency of seven sun protective behaviors: sunscreen use on the face or body; wearing a hat, sunglasses, or long sleeves; running in shade; and avoidance of midday running. Between 54% and 84% of runners reported that they engaged in these behaviors at least sometimes, but only 7% to 45% reported frequent use. Of 525 runners who gave a primary reason for not using sunscreen regularly, 49.0% cited forgetfulness; 17.3% cited discomfort; and only a small percentage cited maintaining a tan (6.1%) or optimizing vitamin D (5.1%). Of 689 runners who responded to a question about what factor most influences their overall sun exposure habits, 39.2% cited fear of skin cancer, 28.7% cited comfort level, and 15.8% cited fear of skin aging. In addition to the seven individual behaviors, we also asked runners how frequently they took precautions to protect against the sun overall. We explored associations between participant characteristics and the overall use of sun protection using ordinal logistic regression. Overall, sun protection was used more frequently in runners who were female, older, or had a history of skin cancer. Runners appear to recognize the importance of sun protection and the potential consequences of not using it, but report forgetfulness and discomfort as the biggest barriers to consistent use. Interventions using habit-formation strategies and self-regulation training may prove to be most useful in closing this gap between knowledge and practice.","['behaviors around sun exposure protective measures', 'sun protection using ordinal logistic regression', 'regulation training may prove', 'seven sun protective behaviors', 'describe sun exposure behaviors', 'small percentage cited maintaining', 'overall sun exposure habits', 'seven individual behaviors', 'interventions using habit', 'sectional online survey', 'using sunscreen regularly', 'cited comfort level', 'athletes including runners', 'also asked runners', 'reported frequent use', 'sun exposure', 'sun protection', 'sun protection', 'sun overall', 'sunscreen use', 'runners reported', 'overall use', 'cited forgetfulness', 'cited fear', 'cited fear', 'consistent use', 'took precautions', 'skin cancer', 'skin cancer', 'skin cancer', 'skin aging', 'runners appear', 'report forgetfulness', 'primary reason', 'primary objective', 'potential consequences', 'poorly described', 'participant characteristics', 'optimizing vitamin', 'long sleeves', 'least sometimes', 'formation strategies', 'explored associations', 'cited discomfort', 'biggest barriers', '697 runners', '689 runners', '525 runners', '1 %).', '1 %)', 'behaviors', 'risk factor', 'midday running', 'using', 'overall', 'runners', 'runners', 'running', 'factor', 'discomfort', 'wearing', 'useful', 'used', 'tan', 'sunglasses', 'shade', 'self', 'responded', 'recognize', 'question', 'protect', 'practice', 'population', 'older', 'measure', 'knowledge', 'knowledge', 'knowledge', 'influences', 'importance', 'history', 'hat', 'gave', 'gap', 'frequently', 'frequently', 'frequency', 'female', 'face', 'engaged', 'cross', 'closing', 'body', 'avoidance', 'administered', 'addition', '84', '8', '7', '7', '6', '54', '5', '49', '45', '39', '3', '28', '2', '17', '15', '0']"

Symptoms, endoscopic scores, and biopsy specimens were compared at baseline and 3 months after treatment. Meanwhile, the expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor and trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) in biopsy specimens were also compared.
Our study showed that the total effective rates of atrophy/intestinal metaplasia in group A reached the same level as group B (51.7% vs. 40.0%, P=0.419). Weierkang significantly improved the total effective rate of atrophy/intestinal metaplasia in gastric angle compared with group B (64.7% vs. 33.3%, P=0.024). Weierkang can significantly lower the total Kyoto risk score (2.6±1.1 vs. 3.3±1.0, P=0.002) and atrophy score (1.4±0.6 vs. 1.8±0.5, P=0.001) after treatment. In addition, Weierkang improves symptoms (1.3±1.3 vs. 2.3±1.8, P=0.003) and epigastric pain (0.2±0.4 vs. 0.5±0.6, P=0.041). The expression of TFF3 in gastric mucosa decreased significantly after treatment with Weierkang (P=0.002).
Weierkang can improve the endoscopic appearance and pathologic changes of chronic atrophic gastritis patients. Symptoms also improved. TFF3 may be involved the pathophysiology mechanism.","['group b received folic acid combined', 'vascular endothelial growth factor', 'traditional chinese medicine may', 'treating chronic atrophic gastritis', 'gastric mucosa decreased significantly', 'total kyoto risk score', 'chronic atrophic gastritis patients', 'patients received weierkang pills', 'chronic atrophic gastritis', 'trefoil factor 3', 'total effective rates', 'total effective rate', 'gastric angle compared', 'weierkang significantly improved', 'symptoms also improved', '3 ± 1', '3 ± 1', '3 ± 1', 'weierkang improves symptoms', '4 ± 0', '6 ± 1', '3 %, p', '8 ± 0', '5 ± 0', '2 ± 0', '0 %, p', 'group b', 'group b', 'weierkang pills', 'significantly lower', '108 patients', 'also compared', '3 months', 'tff3 may', 'atrophy score', '4 vs', '3 vs', 'standard treatments', 'randomly assigned', 'pathophysiology mechanism', 'pathologic changes', 'intestinal metaplasia', 'intestinal metaplasia', 'epigastric pain', 'endoscopic scores', 'endoscopic appearance', 'biopsy specimens', 'biopsy specimens', '419 ).', '041 ).', '024 ).', '1 vs', '2 groups', 'study showed', 'study aims', '6 vs', '002 ).', 'patients', '3', 'group', 'group', 'symptoms', 'effective', 'weierkang', 'weierkang', 'weierkang', '1', '1', '1', 'compared', '8', '6', '5', '2', '2', 'vs', 'vs', 'study', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'p', '002', 'tff3', 'tff3', 'atrophy', 'atrophy', 'treatment', 'treatment', 'treatment', 'teprenone', 'safety', 'reached', 'meanwhile', 'level', 'involved', 'investigate', 'improve', 'expressions', 'expression', 'efficacy', 'currently', 'baseline', 'addition', '7', '7', '64', '51', '40', '33', '003', '001']"
"To assess whether a quality improvement bundle focusing on prevention is effective in reducing pressure injury (PI) incidence or costs or delaying PI onset.
A combined retrospective/prospective cohort study was performed at an academic tertiary care ICU on all patients admitted with a length of stay longer than 48 hours and Braden scale score of 18 or less. Following retrospective data collection (preintervention), a multimodal quality improvement bundle focusing on PI prevention through leadership initiatives, visual tools, and staff/patient education was developed, and data were prospectively collected (postintervention).
Statistical and cost analyses were performed comparing both cohorts. A total of 930 patients met the study inclusion criteria (preintervention, n = 599; postintervention, n = 331). A significant decrease in PI incidence was observed from preintervention (n = 37 [6%]) to postintervention (n = 7 [2%], P = .005). This led to a predicted yearly cost savings of $826,810. Further, a significant increase in time to PI occurrence was observed from preintervention (mean, 5 days) to postintervention (mean, 9 days; P = .04). Staff were compliant with the bundle implementation 80% of the time.
Implementation of the quality improvement bundle focused on multimodal PI prevention in critically ill patients led to a significant reduction in PI incidence, increased time to PI occurrence, and was cost-effective.","['multimodal quality improvement bundle focusing', 'quality improvement bundle focusing', 'quality improvement bundle focused', 'academic tertiary care icu', 'predicted yearly cost savings', 'following retrospective data collection', 'critically ill patients led', 'study inclusion criteria', 'reducing pressure injury', 'prospective cohort study', 'bundle implementation 80', 'braden scale score', '930 patients met', 'multimodal pi prevention', 'delaying pi onset', '2 %], p', 'patients admitted', 'combined retrospective', 'cost analyses', 'pi prevention', 'pi occurrence', 'pi occurrence', 'visual tools', 'stay longer', 'significant reduction', 'significant increase', 'significant decrease', 'prospectively collected', 'patient education', 'leadership initiatives', 'assess whether', '9 days', '6 %])', '5 days', '48 hours', '331 ).', '04 ).', '005 ).', 'pi incidence', 'pi incidence', 'performed comparing', 'increased time', 'preintervention ),', 'postintervention ).', 'led', 'data', 'cost', 'pi', 'prevention', 'p', 'implementation', 'incidence', 'performed', 'time', 'time', 'preintervention', 'preintervention', 'preintervention', 'postintervention', 'postintervention', 'postintervention', 'total', 'statistical', 'staff', 'staff', 'observed', 'observed', 'n', 'n', 'n', 'n', 'mean', 'mean', 'less', 'length', 'effective', 'effective', 'developed', 'costs', 'compliant', 'cohorts', '826', '810', '7', '599', '37', '18']"

"Prostate cancer is multifocal with distinct molecular subtypes. The utility of genomic subtyping has been challenged due to inter- and intra-focal heterogeneity. We sought to characterize the subtype-defining molecular alterations of primary prostate cancer across all tumor foci within radical prostatectomy (RP) specimens and determine the prevalence of collision tumors.
From the Early Detection Research Network cohort, we identified 333 prospectively collected RPs from 2010 to 2014 and assessed ERG, SPINK1, PTEN, and SPOP molecular status. We utilized dual ERG/SPINK1 immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridization to confirm ERG rearrangements and characterize PTEN deletion, and high-resolution melting curve analysis and Sanger sequencing to determine SPOP mutation status. Analysis of biochemical recurrence-free of patients with collision tumors was conducted using Kaplan-Meier method.
Based on index focus alone, ERG, SPINK1, PTEN, and SPOP alterations were identified in 47.5%, 10.8%, 14.3%, and 5.1% of RP specimens, respectively. In 233 multifocal RPs with ERG/SPINK1 status in all foci, 139 (59.7%) had discordant molecular alterations between foci. Collision tumors, as defined by discrepant ERG/SPINK1 status within a single focus, were identified in 29 (9.4%) RP specimens.
Interfocal molecular heterogeneity was identified in ~60% of multifocal RP specimens and collision tumors were present in ~10%. We present this phenomenon as a model for the intra-focal heterogeneity observed in previous studies and propose future genomic studies screen for collision tumors to better characterize molecular heterogeneity.","['early detection research network cohort', 'propose future genomic studies screen', 'tumor foci within radical prostatectomy', 'identified 333 prospectively collected rps', 'resolution melting curve analysis', 'primary prostate cancer across', 'better characterize molecular heterogeneity', 'determine spop mutation status', '4 %) rp specimens', '233 multifocal rps', 'spop molecular status', 'interfocal molecular heterogeneity', 'distinct molecular subtypes', 'conducted using kaplan', 'discordant molecular alterations', 'defining molecular alterations', 'spink1 status within', '8 %, 14', 'index focus alone', 'focal heterogeneity observed', 'utilized dual erg', 'confirm erg rearrangements', 'multifocal rp specimens', 'characterize pten deletion', '5 %, 10', 'prostate cancer', 'spop alterations', 'previous studies', 'genomic subtyping', 'focal heterogeneity', 'rp specimens', '7 %)', 'spink1 status', '3 %,', 'single focus', '10 %.', 'situ hybridization', 'sanger sequencing', 'meier method', 'discrepant erg', 'collision tumors', 'collision tumors', 'collision tumors', 'collision tumors', 'collision tumors', 'challenged due', 'biochemical recurrence', 'assessed erg', 'spink1 immunohistochemistry', 'characterize', 'specimens', 'rp', 'determine', 'analysis', 'multifocal', 'foci', 'foci', 'identified', 'identified', 'identified', 'erg', 'erg', '5', 'spink1', 'spink1', 'pten', 'pten', 'utility', 'subtype', 'sought', 'respectively', 'prevalence', 'present', 'present', 'phenomenon', 'patients', 'model', 'intra', 'intra', 'inter', 'high', 'free', 'fluorescence', 'defined', 'based', '9', '60', '59', '47', '29', '2014', '2010', '139', '1']"

"High levels of moral distress in nursing professionals, of which oncology nurses are particularly prone, can negatively impact patient care, job satisfaction, and retention.
""Positive Attitudes Striving to Rejuvenate You: PASTRY"" was developed at a tertiary cancer center to reduce the burden of moral distress among oncology nurses.
A Quality Improvement (QI) initiative was conducted using a pre- and post-intervention design, to launch PASTRY and measure its impact on moral distress of the nursing unit, using Hamric's Moral Distress Scale-Revised (MDS-R.) This program consisted of monthly 60-minute sessions allowing nurses to address morally distressing events and themes, such as clinicians giving ""false hope"" to patients or families. The PASTRY program sessions were led by certified clinicians utilizing strategies of discussion and mind-body practices.
Clinical nurses working on an adult leukemia/lymphoma unit.
This was a QI initiative, participation was voluntary, MDS-R responses were collected anonymously, and the institution's Ethics Committee oversaw PASTRY's implementation.
While improvement in moral distress findings were not statistically significant, the qualitative and quantitative findings demonstrated consistent themes. The PASTRY program received strong support from nurses and institutional leaders, lowered the nursing unit's moral distress, led to enhanced camaraderie, and improved nurses' coping skills.
Measurement of moral distress is innately challenging due to its complexity. This study reinforces oncology nurses have measurable moral distress. Interventions should be implemented for a safe and healing environment to explore morally distressing clinical experiences. Poor communication among multidisciplinary team members is associated with moral distress among nurses. Programs like PASTRY may empower nurses to build support networks for change within themselves and institutions.
This QI initiative shows further research on moral distress reduction should be conducted to verify findings for statistical significance and so that institutional programs, like PASTRY, can be created.","['poor communication among multidisciplinary team members', 'programs like pastry may empower nurses', 'explore morally distressing clinical experiences', 'quantitative findings demonstrated consistent themes', 'pastry program received strong support', 'moral distress among oncology nurses', 'address morally distressing events', 'ethics committee oversaw pastry', 'study reinforces oncology nurses', 'certified clinicians utilizing strategies', 'minute sessions allowing nurses', 'negatively impact patient care', 'moral distress among nurses', 'clinical nurses working', 'pastry program sessions', 'build support networks', 'moral distress findings', 'tertiary cancer center', 'positive attitudes striving', 'innately challenging due', 'moral distress scale', 'moral distress reduction', 'measurable moral distress', 'like pastry', 'oncology nurses', 'qi initiative shows', 'institutional programs', 'moral distress', 'moral distress', 'moral distress', 'moral distress', 'improved nurses', 'verify findings', 'program consisted', 'launch pastry', 'clinicians giving', 'using hamric', 'statistically significant', 'statistical significance', 'r responses', 'r .)', 'qi initiative', 'particularly prone', 'nursing unit', 'nursing unit', 'nursing professionals', 'monthly 60', 'lymphoma unit', 'job satisfaction', 'intervention design', 'institutional leaders', 'high levels', 'healing environment', 'false hope', 'enhanced camaraderie', 'coping skills', 'collected anonymously', 'change within', 'body practices', 'adult leukemia', 'quality improvement', 'conducted using', 'nurses', 'pastry', 'themes', 'impact', 'qi', 'initiative', 'improvement', 'conducted', 'voluntary', 'safe', 'revised', 'retention', 'research', 'rejuvenate', 'reduce', 'qualitative', 'pre', 'post', 'patients', 'participation', 'mind', 'measurement', 'measure', 'mds', 'mds', 'lowered', 'led', 'led', 'interventions', 'institutions', 'institution', 'implemented', 'implementation', 'families', 'discussion', 'developed', 'created', 'complexity', 'burden', 'associated']"

"Although most patients with microsatellite instable (MSI) metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) respond to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), only a small subset of patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors have similar benefit. Biomarkers defining ICB-susceptible subsets of patients with MSS mCRPC are urgently needed.
Using next-generation T-cell repertoire sequencing, we explored immune signatures in 54 patients with MSS and MSI mCRPC who were treated with or without ICB. We defined subset-specific immune metrics as well as T-cell clusters and correlated the signatures with treatment benefit.
Consistent overlaps between tumor and peripheral T-cell repertoires suggested that blood was an informative material to identify relevant T-cell signatures. We found considerably higher blood T-cell richness and diversity and more shared T-cell clusters with low generation probability (pGen) in MSI versus MSS mCRPC, potentially reflecting more complex T-cell responses because of a greater neoepitope load in the MSI subset. Interestingly, patients with MSS mCRPC with shared low pGen T-cell clusters showed significantly better outcomes with ICB, but not with other treatments, compared with patients without such clusters. Blood clearance of T-cell clusters on ICB treatment initiation seemed to be compatible with T-cell migration to the primary tumor or metastatic sites during the process of clonal replacement as described for other tumors receiving ICB.
The MSI mCRPC subset shows a distinct T-cell signature that can be detected in blood. This signature points to immune parameters that could help identify a subset of patients with MSS mCRPC who may have an increased likelihood of responding to ICB or to combination approaches including ICB.","['cell clusters showed significantly better outcomes', 'combination approaches including icb', 'found considerably higher blood', 'icb treatment initiation seemed', 'msi mcrpc subset shows', 'msi versus mss mcrpc', 'resistant prostate cancer', 'greater neoepitope load', 'specific immune metrics', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'cell repertoires suggested', 'cell repertoire sequencing', 'could help identify', 'biomarkers defining icb', 'low generation probability', 'explored immune signatures', 'tumors receiving icb', 'shared low pgen', 'cell clusters', 'cell clusters', 'cell clusters', 'msi mcrpc', 'treatment benefit', 'msi subset', 'immune parameters', 'cell signatures', 'cell signature', 'cell richness', 'cell responses', 'cell migration', 'without icb', 'identify relevant', 'icb ),', 'mss mcrpc', 'mss mcrpc', 'mss mcrpc', 'small subset', 'defined subset', 'using next', 'urgently needed', 'susceptible subsets', 'similar benefit', 'signature points', 'potentially reflecting', 'microsatellite stable', 'microsatellite instable', 'metastatic sites', 'metastatic castration', 'informative material', 'increased likelihood', 'consistent overlaps', 'clonal replacement', 'blood clearance', 'primary tumor', 'patients without', '54 patients', 'msi', 'clusters', 'icb', 'icb', 'mcrpc', 'subset', 'tumors', 'signatures', 'shared', 'pgen', 'mss', 'mss', 'generation', 'blood', 'blood', 'tumor', 'patients', 'patients', 'patients', 'patients', 'patients', 'well', 'treatments', 'treated', 'responding', 'respond', 'process', 'peripheral', 'may', 'interestingly', 'diversity', 'distinct', 'detected', 'described', 'correlated', 'complex', 'compatible', 'compared', 'although']"
"Somatic mutations derived from the expansion of clonal populations of blood cells (clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential, or CHIP) may be detected in sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples. We evaluated the potential implications of CHIP in targeted sequencing of plasma samples using matched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with lung cancer to identify potential CHIP-associated mutations.
A total of 332 plasma and corresponding PBMC samples were collected predose, cycle 1 day 1 (C1D1), from the randomized, phase III study (OAK) comparing atezolizumab versus docetaxel in previously treated patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The samples were analyzed with the AVENIO ctDNA Surveillance Kit (for research use only; not for use in diagnostic procedures), a 198-kb next-generation sequencing panel targeting cancer-related genes. CHIP variants were assessed by analyzing both plasma and PBMC sequencing data.
A range of zero to eight CHIP variants (median = one) was detected per cfDNA sample. Most of these variants were not in the Database of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (dbSNP). The number of CHIP variants was positively associated with age, and

"Accurate monitoring of therapeutic response remains an important unmet need for patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Analysis of tumor genomics obtained via circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) can provide a comprehensive overview of tumor evolution.

Paired blood samples from patients with MBC were analyzed for levels of ctDNA, carcinoembryonic antigen, and cancer antigen 15-3 at baseline and during treatment. A Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified sequencing panel of 73 genes was used to quantify tumor-specific point mutations in ctDNA.

"Pretreatment estimates of seminal vesicle invasion (SVI) are challenging and significantly influence the management of prostate cancer. We sought to improve current models to predict SVI through the development of an SVI prediction genomic signature.
A total of 15,889 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) with available baseline clinical, pathology, and transcriptome data were retrieved from the GRID registry (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02609269) and other retrospective cohorts. These data were divided into a training (n = 6,766), test (n = 3,363), and two validation (n = 5,062 and 698) cohorts. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess the predictive effect of the genomic SVI (gSVI) classifier in the presence of established nomograms (Partin Tables and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center [MSKCC]).
In the training cohort, univariable filtering identified 2,132 genes that were differentially expressed between RP tumors with and without SVI. Model parameters were tuned to maximize the area under the curve (AUC) in the testing cohort, resulting in a logistic generalized linear model with 581 genes. The gSVI model scores range from 0 to 1. In the first validation set, gSVI showed superior discrimination of patients with and without SVI at RP compared with other prognostic signatures trained to predict distant metastasis or clinical recurrence. Of the 698 patients in the second validation set, gSVI combined with the MSKCC nomogram had a superior AUC (0.86) compared with either nomogram individually (0.81).

"Programmed cell death receptor ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression is the most studied biomarker to predict the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), but its clinical significance is controversial. We estimated the distribution of PD-L1 expression scores (ie, tumor proportion score or combined proportion score) and the relationship between PD-L1 levels and ICIs' impact on overall survival (OS).
We reconstructed, pooled, and analyzed individual-level data on 7,617 patients with cancer from 14 randomized clinical trials. The effects of ICIs were quantified using differences in 24-month restricted mean survival times (ΔRMSTs; ie, the increase in life expectancy truncated at 2 years associated with ICI therapy). In a simulation study, we compared standard randomized clinical trial designs with a trial design that leverages meta-analytic results like ours.
Approximately 93% of patients had a PD-L1 expression ≤ 5% (66% of patients) or > 50% (27% of patients). OS improves with ICIs regardless of PD-L1 expression level, which predicts the benefits' magnitude. For patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), ΔRMSTs ranged from 1.4 months (95% probability interval [PI], 0.7 to 2.2 months) for PD-L1 expression ≤ 1% to 4.1 months (95% PI, 3.2 to 5.2 months) for PD-L1 expression > 80%. For patients with non-NSCLC tumors, ΔRMSTs ranged from 0.8 months (95% PI, -0.1 to 1.7 months) to 2.3 months (95% PI, 1.3 to 4.4 months), again for PD-L1 expression levels of ≤ 1% and > 80%, respectively. Simulations suggested that designs tailored to meta-analytic results can detect the effects of ICIs in PD-L1 subgroups with higher probability (> 15%) than standard designs.
The practice of dichotomizing the range of PD-L1 expression scores is inadequate for patient stratification.

A retrospective cohort analysis was conducted of 1,028 adult patients with metastatic cancer who were sequenced with tumor and germline whole exome sequencing (WES). Germline variant call files were mined for pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants using the ClinVar database and narrowed to high-quality submitters.
Median age was 59 years, with 16% of patients ≤ 45 years old.

"Given regulatory approval of immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients with mismatch repair-deficient (MMR-D) cancers agnostic to tumor type, it has become important to characterize occurrence of MMR-D and develop cost-effective screening approaches. Using a next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel (OncoPanel), we developed an algorithm to identify MMR-D frequency in tumor samples and applied it in a clinical setting with pathologist review.
To predict MMR-D, we adapted methods described previously for use in NGS panels, which assess patterns of single base-pair insertion or deletion events occurring in homopolymer regions. Tumors assayed with OncoPanel between July 2013 and July 2018 were included. For tumors tested after June 2017, sequencing results were presented to pathologists in real time for clinical MMR determination, in the context of tumor mutation burden, other mutational signatures, and clinical data.
Of 20,301 tumors sequenced, 2.7% (553) were retrospectively classified as MMR-D by the algorithm. Of 4,404 samples with pathologist sign-out of MMR status, the algorithm classified 147 (3.3%) as MMR-D: in 116 cases, MMR-D was confirmed by a pathologist, five cases were overruled by the pathologist, and 26 were assessed as indeterminate. Overall, the highest frequencies of OncoPanel-inferred MMR-D were in endometrial (21%; 152/723), colorectal (9.7%; 169/1,744), and small bowel (9.3%; 9/97) cancers. When algorithm predictions were compared with historical MMR immunohistochemistry or polymerase chain reaction results in a set of 325 tumors sequenced before initiation of pathologist assessment, the overall sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm were 91.1% and 98.2%, respectively.
We show that targeted, tumor-only NGS can be leveraged to determine MMR signatures across tumor types, suggesting that broader biomarker screening approaches may have clinical value.","['determine mmr signatures across tumor types', 'broader biomarker screening approaches may', 'adapted methods described previously', 'polymerase chain reaction results', 'effective screening approaches', 'immune checkpoint inhibitors', 'given regulatory approval', 'deletion events occurring', '21 %; 152', 'tumor mutation burden', '325 tumors sequenced', '301 tumors sequenced', '723 ), colorectal', 'historical mmr immunohistochemistry', '7 %; 169', '2 %, respectively', 'clinical mmr determination', 'algorithm classified 147', '3 %; 9', 'mutational signatures', 'sequencing results', 'tumor type', 'tumor samples', 'tumors tested', 'tumors assayed', 'retrospectively classified', '744 ),', 'clinical value', 'clinical setting', 'clinical data', 'predict mmr', 'mmr status', 'inferred mmr', 'identify mmr', 'small bowel', 'single base', 'real time', 'pair insertion', 'mismatch repair', 'june 2017', 'july 2018', 'july 2013', 'homopolymer regions', 'highest frequencies', 'generation sequencing', 'five cases', 'develop cost', 'characterize occurrence', 'become important', 'assess patterns', '404 samples', '3 %)', '116 cases', 'oncopanel ),', 'pathologist sign', 'pathologist review', 'pathologist assessment', 'algorithm predictions', 'overall sensitivity', 'cancers agnostic', 'ngs panels', 'tumor', 'mmr', 'mmr', 'mmr', 'mmr', 'mmr', '7', '3', '2', '9', '9', 'pathologist', 'pathologist', 'algorithm', 'algorithm', 'algorithm', 'overall', 'cancers', 'oncopanel', 'oncopanel', 'ngs', 'ngs', 'using', 'use', 'targeted', 'suggesting', 'specificity', 'show', 'set', 'presented', 'patients', 'pathologists', 'panel', 'overruled', 'next', 'leveraged', 'initiation', 'indeterminate', 'included', 'frequency', 'endometrial', 'developed', 'deficient', 'context', 'confirmed', 'compared', 'assessed', 'applied', '98', '97', '91', '553', '4', '26', '20', '1', '1']"
"The routine use of large next-generation sequencing (NGS) pan-cancer panels is required to identify the increasing number of, but often uncommon, actionable alterations to guide therapy. Inconsistent coverage and variable payment is hindering NGS adoption into clinical practice. A review of test utilization, clinical utility, coverage, and reimbursement was conducted in a cohort of patients diagnosed with high-risk cancer who received pan-cancer panel testing as part of their clinical care.
The Columbia Combined Cancer Panel (CCCP), a 467-gene panel designed to detect DNA variations in solid and liquid tumors, was performed in the Laboratory of Personalized Genomic Medicine at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. Utilization was characterized at test order. Results were reviewed by a molecular pathologist, followed by a multidisciplinary molecular tumor board where clinical utility was classified by consensus. Reimbursement was reviewed after payers provided final coverage decisions.
NGS was performed on 359 high-risk tumors from 349 patients. Reimbursement data were available for 246 cases. The most common reason providers ordered CCCP testing was for patients diagnosed with a treatment-resistant or recurrent tumor (n = 214; 61%). Findings were clinically impactful for 229 cases (64%). Molecular alterations that may inform future therapy in the event of progression or relapse were found in 42% of cases, and a targeted therapy was initiated in 23 cases (6.6%). The majority of tests were denied coverage by payers (n = 190; 77%). On average, insurers reimbursed 10.75% of the total NGS service charge.

The UMCG-MTB comprises (pulmonary) oncologists, pathologists, clinical scientists in molecular pathology, and structural biologists. Recommendations are based on reported actionability of variants and molecular interpretation of pathways affected by the variant and supported by molecular modeling. A retrospective analysis of 110 NSCLC cases (representing 106 patients) with suggested treatment of complex genomic alterations and corresponding treatment outcomes for targeted therapy was performed.
The MTB recommended targeted therapy for 59 of 110 NSCLC cases with complex molecular profiles: 24 within a clinical trial, 15 in accordance with guidelines (on label) and 20 off label. All but 16 recommendations involved patients with an 
Targeted therapy recommendations resulting from the UMCG-MTB workflow for complex molecular profiles were highly adhered to and resulted in a positive clinical response in the majority of patients with metastatic NSCLC.","['university medical center groningen', 'targeted therapy recommendations resulting', '16 recommendations involved patients', 'mtb recommended targeted therapy', 'specific genomic alterations', 'cell lung cancer', 'complex mutational profiles', 'complex genomic alterations', 'positive clinical response', 'corresponding treatment outcomes', 'complex molecular profiles', 'complex molecular profiles', 'representing 106 patients', '110 nsclc cases', '110 nsclc cases', 'molecular tumor boards', 'targeted therapy', 'complex tumor', 'mtb workflow', 'mtb decision', 'mtb comprises', 'molecular pathology', 'molecular modeling', 'molecular interpretation', 'suggested treatment', 'clinical trial', 'clinical scientists', 'metastatic nsclc', 'structural biologists', 'retrospective analysis', 'reported actionability', 'provide physicians', 'pathways affected', 'making methodology', 'international consensus', 'highly adhered', '24 within', 'treatment recommendation', 'umcg ).', 'recommendations', 'patients', 'patients', 'nsclc', 'recommendation', 'umcg', 'umcg', 'variants', 'variant', 'supported', 'small', 'resulted', 'reach', 'rare', 'pulmonary', 'performed', 'pathologists', 'oncologists', 'non', 'national', 'mtbs', 'majority', 'lacking', 'label', 'label', 'implemented', 'guidelines', 'effectiveness', 'based', 'article', 'analyze', 'accordance', '59', '20', '15']"
"The combination chemotherapy of fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) has provided clinically meaningful improvement for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). We previously uncovered a role for the serine hydrolase carboxylesterase 2 (CES2) in mediating intratumoral activation of the prodrug irinotecan, a constituent of FOLFIRINOX. We aimed to further test the predictive value of CES2 for response to irinotecan using patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models and to elucidate the determinants of CES2 expression and response to FOLFIRINOX treatment among patients with PDAC.
PDXs were engrafted subcutaneously into nude mice and treated for 4 weeks with either saline control or irinotecan. CES2 and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A) expression in PDAC tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were applied to assess the association between overall survival and hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) levels in patients who underwent neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX treatment.
High CES2 activity in PDAC PDXs was associated with increased sensitivity to irinotecan. Integrated gene expression, proteomic analyses, and in vitro genetic experiments revealed that nuclear receptor HNF4A, which is upregulated in diabetes, is the upstream transcriptional regulator of CES2 expression. Elevated CES2 protein expression in PDAC tissues was positively associated with a history of type 2 diabetes (odds ratio, 4.84; 
To our knowledge, we provide, for the first time, evidence that CES2 expression is associated with a history of type 2 diabetes in PDAC and that elevated HbA1C, by predicting tumor CES2 expression, may represent a novel marker for stratifying patients most likely to respond to FOLFIRINOX therapy.","['hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha', 'vitro genetic experiments revealed', 'provided clinically meaningful improvement', 'serine hydrolase carboxylesterase 2', 'underwent neoadjuvant folfirinox treatment', 'predicting tumor ces2 expression', 'folfirinox treatment among patients', 'elevated ces2 protein expression', 'western blot analysis', 'upstream transcriptional regulator', 'pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma', 'nuclear receptor hnf4a', 'mediating intratumoral activation', 'either saline control', 'type 2 diabetes', 'type 2 diabetes', 'integrated gene expression', 'cox regression analyses', 'high ces2 activity', 'irinotecan using patient', 'ces2 expression', 'ces2 expression', 'ces2 expression', '4 weeks', 'proteomic analyses', 'elevated hba1c', 'folfirinox therapy', 'stratifying patients', 'previously uncovered', 'predictive value', 'overall survival', 'odds ratio', 'nude mice', 'novel marker', 'may represent', 'increased sensitivity', 'hemoglobin a1c', 'first time', 'engrafted subcutaneously', 'derived xenograft', 'combination chemotherapy', 'pdac tissues', 'pdac tissues', 'pdac ).', 'prodrug irinotecan', 'positively associated', 'pdac pdxs', '4', 'expression', 'folfirinox', 'folfirinox', 'patients', 'diabetes', 'ces2', 'ces2', 'ces2', 'hnf4a', 'pdac', 'pdac', 'irinotecan', 'irinotecan', 'irinotecan', 'pdxs', 'hba1c', 'associated', 'associated', 'upregulated', 'treated', 'test', 'role', 'response', 'response', 'respond', 'provide', 'pdx', 'oxaliplatin', 'models', 'meier', 'likely', 'levels', 'leucovorin', 'knowledge', 'kaplan', 'immunohistochemical', 'history', 'history', 'fluorouracil', 'evidence', 'evaluated', 'elucidate', 'determinants', 'constituent', 'association', 'assess', 'applied', 'aimed', '84']"

"We investigated the prevalence and spectrum of pathogenic germline variants in patients with early-onset colorectal cancer (CRC), breast cancer (BC), and prostate cancer (PCA) in the Japanese population. We also identified pathogenic variants in other cancer risk genes, giving consideration to future multigene testing panels for this population.
We performed whole-genome sequencing for 1,037 Japanese individuals, including patients with early-onset CRC (n = 196), BC (n = 237), and PCA (n = 215) and controls (n = 389). We screened for pathogenic variants, including single nucleotide variants and copy number variants, among well-established first-tier cancer genes for each cancer type and examined an expended second-tier panel including cancer-predisposing genes from the Cancer Gene Census.
Proportions of patients with germline pathogenic variants differed by cancer subgroup, with the highest in BC (14.8%), followed by CRC (9.2%), and PCA (3.7%). In contrast, 2 of 389 control subjects (0.5%) carried a germline pathogenic variant. In comparison with controls, the proportion of patients with pathogenic variants in the second-tier panel was increased significantly for PCA (3.7% to 11.6%,

"Cloquet's node, located at the junction between the deep inguinal nodes and the external iliac chain, is easily accessible and commonly excised during pelvic lymph node dissection for prostate cancer. However, we hypothesize that Cloquet's node is not part of lymphatic metastatic spread of prostate cancer.
Between September 2016 and June 2019, 105 consecutive patients with high-risk prostate cancer (cT3a+or Grade Group 4/5 or PSA >20 ng/mL) underwent a laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection. First, Cloquet's node was identified, retrieved, and submitted separately to pathology as right and left Cloquet's node. Next, a pelvic lymph node dissection was completed including the external iliac, obturator fossa, and hypogastric nodal packets. Each lymph node was cut in 3-mm slices which were separately embedded in paraffin, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and examined microscopically.
The final analysis included 95 patients. In this high-risk population, the median number of nodes removed was 22 (IQR 18-29); 39/95 patients (41%) had lymph node metastasis.

"Many chemotherapeutic drugs exert their cytotoxicity through the formation of DNA modifications (adducts), which interfere with DNA replication, an overactive process in rapidly dividing cancer cells. Side effects from the therapy are common, however, because these drugs also affect rapidly dividing noncancerous cells. Hypoxia-activated prodrugs (HAPs) have been developed to reduce these side effects as they preferentially activate in hypoxic environments, a hallmark of solid tumors. CP-506 is a newly developed DNA-alkylating HAP designed to exert strong activity under hypoxia. The resulting CP-506-DNA adducts can be used to elucidate the cellular and molecular effects of CP-506 and its selectivity toward hypoxic conditions. In this study, we characterize the profile of adducts resulting from the reaction of CP-506 and its metabolites CP-506H and CP-506M with DNA. A total of 39 putative DNA adducts were detected in vitro using our high-resolution/accurate-mass (HRAM) liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS","['drugs also affect rapidly dividing noncancerous cells', 'liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry', 'rapidly dividing cancer cells', 'many chemotherapeutic drugs exert', 'selectivity toward hypoxic conditions', '39 putative dna adducts', 'exert strong activity', 'alkylating hap designed', 'newly developed dna', 'hypoxic environments', 'dna adducts', 'adducts resulting', 'adducts ),', 'dna replication', 'dna modifications', 'vitro using', 'solid tumors', 'side effects', 'side effects', 'preferentially activate', 'overactive process', 'molecular effects', 'activated prodrugs', 'resulting cp', 'metabolites cp', 'mass', 'dna', 'developed', 'cp', 'cp', 'cp', 'cp', 'used', 'total', 'therapy', 'study', 'resolution', 'reduce', 'reaction', 'profile', 'ms', 'lc', 'interfere', 'hypoxia', 'hypoxia', 'hram', 'however', 'high', 'haps', 'hallmark', 'formation', 'elucidate', 'detected', 'cytotoxicity', 'common', 'characterize', 'cellular', 'accurate', '506m', '506h', '506', '506', '506', '506']"
"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a treatment modality where light-mediated activation of photosensitizers in a patient's body leads to the generation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), eliminating cancer cells. One direction that has been firmly established over past years is the conjugation of photosensitizers with various molecules that demonstrate their own cytotoxic activity. As a result, improved selectivity and treatment outcomes are observed compared to those of unconjugated drugs. The attractiveness of such an approach is due to the variability of cytotoxic warheads and specific linkers available for the construction of conjugates. In this review, we summarize and analyze data concerning these inventions with the ultimate goal to find a promising conjugation partner for a porphyrinoid-based photosensitizer. The current challenges toward successful conjugation are also outlined and discussed. We hope that this review will motivate researchers to pay closer attention to conjugates and possibilities hidden in these molecules for the PDT of cancer.","['ros ), eliminating cancer cells', 'current challenges toward successful conjugation', 'cytotoxic reactive oxygen species', 'specific linkers available', 'promising conjugation partner', 'pay closer attention', 'analyze data concerning', 'cytotoxic warheads', 'cytotoxic activity', 'unconjugated drugs', 'ultimate goal', 'treatment outcomes', 'treatment modality', 'possibilities hidden', 'photodynamic therapy', 'past years', 'one direction', 'observed compared', 'motivate researchers', 'mediated activation', 'improved selectivity', 'firmly established', 'body leads', 'based photosensitizer', 'also outlined', 'various molecules', 'conjugation', 'cancer', 'molecules', 'variability', 'summarize', 'review', 'review', 'result', 'porphyrinoid', 'photosensitizers', 'photosensitizers', 'pdt', 'pdt', 'patient', 'light', 'inventions', 'hope', 'generation', 'find', 'due', 'discussed', 'demonstrate', 'construction', 'conjugates', 'conjugates', 'attractiveness', 'approach']"

"8-Oxoguanine DNA glycosylase is essential for maintaining genomic integrity and stability, while its abnormal activity may lead to the disturbance in the normal DNA damage repair and the occurrence of carcinogenicity and teratogenicity. Herein, we construct a CRISPR-Cas-based biosensor for rapid and sensitive measurement of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylases. This biosensor involves a hairpin probe and integrates quadratic strand displacement amplification (SDA) with a CRISPR/Cas12a effector with the characteristics of rapidity (within 40 min) and isothermal assay. The presence of 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase can initiate the quadratic SDA to produce large amounts of activators with the assistance of polynucleotide kinase (PNK). Subsequently, the activators can bind with crRNA to activate Cas12a, cleaving signal probes and recovering Cy5 fluorescence, which can be accurately quantified by single-molecule imaging. Notably, the designed hairpin probes can effectively block the hybridization of the generated activators with free hairpin probes, endowing this biosensor with high sensitivity. In addition, the utilization of PNK instead of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE1) greatly simplifies the experimental procedure to only a one-step reaction. The introduction of a single-molecule detection further reduces the sample consumption and improves the sensitivity.

"Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) enzymes are over-expressed by some metastatic cancers, in which they are responsible for the degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix. In recent years, MMPs have emerged as promising targets for enzyme-responsive diagnostic probes because oligopeptides can be designed to be selectively hydrolyzed by exposure to these enzymes. With the ultimate goal of developing radio-iodinated peptides as supramolecular building blocks for MMP-sensitive tools for nuclear imaging and therapy, we designed three MMP-9-responsive peptides containing either tyrosine or iodotyrosine to assess the impact of iodotyrosine introduction to the peptide structure and cleavage kinetics. We found that the peptides containing iodotyrosine underwent more rapid and more complete hydrolysis by MMP-9. While the peptides under investigation were predominantly disordered, it was found that iodination increased the degree of aromatic residue-driven aggregation of the peptides. We determined that these iodination-related trends stem from the improved overall intramolecular order through H- and halogen bonding, in addition to intermolecular organization of the self-assembled peptides due to steric and electrostatic effects introduced by the halogenated tyrosine. These fundamental observations provide insights for the development of enzyme-triggered peptide aggregation tools for localized radioactive iodine-based tumor imaging.","['responsive peptides containing either tyrosine', 'improved overall intramolecular order', 'fundamental observations provide insights', 'peptides containing iodotyrosine underwent', 'triggered peptide aggregation tools', 'responsive diagnostic probes', 'supramolecular building blocks', 'related trends stem', 'localized radioactive iodine', 'electrostatic effects introduced', 'assembled peptides due', 'based tumor imaging', 'designed three mmp', 'halogenated tyrosine', 'sensitive tools', 'peptide structure', 'driven aggregation', 'iodinated peptides', 'nuclear imaging', 'iodotyrosine introduction', 'ultimate goal', 'selectively hydrolyzed', 'recent years', 'promising targets', 'predominantly disordered', 'metastatic cancers', 'matrix metalloproteinase', 'intermolecular organization', 'halogen bonding', 'extracellular matrix', 'developing radio', 'complete hydrolysis', 'cleavage kinetics', 'aromatic residue', 'iodination increased', 'peptides', 'peptides', 'iodotyrosine', 'designed', 'mmp', 'mmp', 'mmp', 'iodination', 'therapy', 'steric', 'self', 'responsible', 'remodeling', 'rapid', 'oligopeptides', 'mmps', 'investigation', 'impact', 'h', 'found', 'found', 'expressed', 'exposure', 'enzymes', 'enzymes', 'enzyme', 'enzyme', 'emerged', 'development', 'determined', 'degree', 'degradation', 'assess', 'addition', '9', '9']"
"Therapeutic antibodies have become one of the most widely used classes of biotherapeutics due to their unique antigen specificity and their ability to be engineered against diverse disease targets. There is significant interest in utilizing truncated antibody fragments as therapeutics, as their small size affords favorable properties such as increased tumor penetration as well as the ability to utilize lower-cost prokaryotic production methods. Their small size and simple architecture, however, also lead to rapid blood clearance, limiting the efficacy of these potentially powerful therapeutics. A common approach to circumvent these limitations is to enable engagement with the half-life extending neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). This is usually achieved via fusion with a large Fc domain, which negates the benefits of the antibody fragment's small size. In this work, we show that modifying antibody fragments with short FcRn-binding peptide domains that mimic native IgG engagement with FcRn enables binding and FcRn-mediated recycling and transmembrane transcytosis in cell-based assays. Further, we show that rational, single amino acid mutations to the peptide sequence have a significant impact on the receptor-mediated function and investigate the underlying structural basis for this effect using computational modeling. Finally, we report the identification of a short peptide from human serum albumin that enables FcRn-mediated function when grafted onto a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) scaffold, establishing an approach for the rational selection of short-peptide domains from full-length proteins that could enable the transfer of non-native functions to small recombinant proteins without significantly impacting their size or structure.","['small recombinant proteins without significantly impacting', 'life extending neonatal fc receptor', 'small size affords favorable properties', 'usually achieved via fusion', 'effect using computational modeling', 'cost prokaryotic production methods', 'utilizing truncated antibody fragments', 'single amino acid mutations', 'mimic native igg engagement', 'large fc domain', 'modifying antibody fragments', 'widely used classes', 'unique antigen specificity', 'underlying structural basis', 'rapid blood clearance', 'increased tumor penetration', 'human serum albumin', 'diverse disease targets', 'chain variable fragment', 'potentially powerful therapeutics', 'binding peptide domains', 'fcrn enables binding', 'small size', 'small size', 'length proteins', 'antibody fragment', 'native functions', 'enable engagement', 'peptide domains', 'enables fcrn', 'peptide sequence', 'utilize lower', 'transmembrane transcytosis', 'therapeutic antibodies', 'simple architecture', 'significant interest', 'significant impact', 'mediated recycling', 'mediated function', 'mediated function', 'grafted onto', 'fcrn ).', 'could enable', 'biotherapeutics due', 'become one', 'based assays', 'also lead', 'short peptide', 'short fcrn', 'rational selection', 'common approach', 'receptor', 'size', 'single', 'therapeutics', 'fcrn', 'short', 'rational', 'approach', 'work', 'well', 'transfer', 'structure', 'show', 'show', 'scfv', 'scaffold', 'report', 'non', 'negates', 'limiting', 'limitations', 'investigate', 'identification', 'however', 'half', 'full', 'finally', 'establishing', 'engineered', 'efficacy', 'circumvent', 'cell', 'benefits', 'ability', 'ability']"
"Cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia (CLH) is a benign reactive process with T-cell or B-cell lymphocytic infiltration in the skin, which can simulate cutaneous lymphomas both clinically and histologically. Various antigenic stimuli have been implicated in the development of CLH, including tick bites. Finding histologic evidence of such triggering factors, however, is often difficult. Moreover, the presence of clonality in CLH can potentially be interpreted as a neoplastic process, posing a further diagnostic challenge to dermatopathologists, if one is not aware of such peculiar phenomena. Herein, we describe a case of CLH secondary to a tick bite, featuring both T-cell clonality and monotypic plasma cells with lambda light chain restriction; the diagnostic clue being tick parts, which became evident on assessment of deeper levels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a tick-associated clonal CLH with simultaneous detection of monoclonal T cells and monotypic lambda light chain restriction, mimicking primary cutaneous CD4+ small/medium T-cell lymphoproliferative disorder and Borrelia-associated primary cutaneous marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, respectively.","['associated primary cutaneous marginal zone b', 'monotypic lambda light chain restriction', 'lambda light chain restriction', 'mimicking primary cutaneous cd4', 'simulate cutaneous lymphomas', 'cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia', 'associated clonal clh', 'various antigenic stimuli', 'monotypic plasma cells', 'finding histologic evidence', 'benign reactive process', 'cell lymphoproliferative disorder', 'cell lymphocytic infiltration', 'including tick bites', 'first reported case', 'neoplastic process', 'cell lymphoma', 'triggering factors', 'tick parts', 'tick bite', 'simultaneous detection', 'peculiar phenomena', 'often difficult', 'diagnostic clue', 'diagnostic challenge', 'deeper levels', 'became evident', 'cell clonality', 'clh secondary', 'b', 'cell', 'tick', 'cells', 'case', 'clh', 'clh', 'clh', 'clonality', 'small', 'skin', 'respectively', 'presence', 'potentially', 'posing', 'one', 'moreover', 'monoclonal', 'medium', 'knowledge', 'interpreted', 'implicated', 'however', 'histologically', 'herein', 'featuring', 'development', 'describe', 'dermatopathologists', 'clinically', 'borrelia', 'best', 'aware', 'assessment']"
"Cell division cycle 20 (CDC20) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are differentially expressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The current study aimed to investigate the role of miR-1321 and miR-7515 regulation in CDC20 during NSCLC development. CDC20 expression in paracancerous and tumor tissues was assessed using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The relationship between CDC20 expression and prognosis of patients was analyzed using the TCGA database. The expression profile of CDC20 in healthy lung cells and NSCLC cells was detected using qRT-PCR and western blotting. After the knockdown of CDC20 in NSCLC cells, the cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration, invasion, and cell cycle changes were investigated by CCK8, EdU, flow cytometry, wound healing, and Transwell assays. The miRNAs targeting CDC20 were predicted using two bioinformatics websites and validated using dual-luciferase assays. CDC20 was enhanced in NSCLC tissues and cells, thus predicting the poor prognosis in NSCLC patients. After CDC20 inhibition, the malignant phenotype of NSCLC cells was reverted. miR-1321 and miR-7515 targeted CDC20 and exhibited the same anti-tumor effects as CDC20 silencing. Functional rescue experiments showed that CDC20 overexpression averted the anti-tumor effects of miR-1321 and miR-7515 on NSCLC cells. miR-1321 and miR-7515 inhibited NSCLC development by targeting CDC20.

"Neuropathic pain is a prevalent and debilitating chronic disease that is characterized by activation in glial cells in various pain-related regions within the central nervous system. Recent studies have suggested a sexually dimorphic role of microglia in the maintenance of neuropathic pain in rodents. Here, we utilized RNA sequencing analysis and in vitro primary cultures of microglia to identify whether there is a common neuropathic microglial signature and characterize the sex differences in microglia in pain-related regions in nerve injury and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy mouse models. While mechanical allodynia and behavioral changes were observed in all models, transcriptomic analysis of microglia revealed no common transcriptional changes in spinal and supraspinal regions and in the different neuropathic models. However, there was a substantial change in microglial gene expression within the ipsilateral lumbar spinal cord 7 days after chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve. Both sexes upregulated genes associated with inflammation, phagosome, and lysosome activation, though males revealed a prominent global transcriptional shift not observed in female mice. Transcriptomic comparison between male spinal microglia after CCI and data from other nerve injury models and neurodegenerative microglia demonstrated a unique CCI-induced signature reflecting acute activation of microglia. Further, in vitro studies revealed that only male microglia from nerve-injured mice developed a reactive phenotype with increased phagocytotic activity. This study demonstrates a lack of a common neuropathic microglial signature and indicates distinct sex differences in spinal microglia, suggesting they contribute to the sex-specific pain processing following nerve injury.","['ipsilateral lumbar spinal cord 7 days', 'specific pain processing following nerve injury', 'induced peripheral neuropathy mouse models', 'induced signature reflecting acute activation', 'sexes upregulated genes associated', 'prominent global transcriptional shift', 'microglial gene expression within', 'utilized rna sequencing analysis', 'common neuropathic microglial signature', 'common neuropathic microglial signature', 'indicates distinct sex differences', 'common transcriptional changes', 'chronic constriction injury', 'nerve injury models', 'vitro primary cultures', 'sexually dimorphic role', 'increased phagocytotic activity', 'different neuropathic models', 'debilitating chronic disease', 'central nervous system', 'though males revealed', 'injured mice developed', 'related regions within', 'vitro studies revealed', 'neurodegenerative microglia demonstrated', 'male spinal microglia', 'nerve injury', 'neuropathic pain', 'neuropathic pain', 'sex differences', 'transcriptomic analysis', 'related regions', 'sciatic nerve', 'spinal microglia', 'lysosome activation', 'various pain', 'recent studies', 'female mice', 'behavioral changes', 'microglia revealed', 'supraspinal regions', 'male microglia', 'transcriptomic comparison', 'substantial change', 'study demonstrates', 'reactive phenotype', 'mechanical allodynia', 'identify whether', 'glial cells', 'unique cci', 'spinal', 'models', 'nerve', 'activation', 'pain', 'sex', 'microglia', 'microglia', 'microglia', 'microglia', 'cci', 'cci', 'suggesting', 'suggested', 'rodents', 'prevalent', 'phagosome', 'observed', 'observed', 'maintenance', 'lack', 'inflammation', 'however', 'data', 'contribute', 'chemotherapy', 'characterized', 'characterize']"
"PTTG1 is almost undetectable in adult livers, but is highly expressed in hepatocarcinoma. While little is known about its involvement in liver fibrosis, PTTG1 expression is associated with DLK1. We assessed the role of the PTTG1/DLK1 pathway in fibrosis progression and the potential therapeutic effect of PTTG1 silencing in fibrosis.
Pttg1 and Dlk1 were studied in liver and isolated cell populations of control and fibrotic rats and in human liver biopsies. The fibrotic molecular signature was analyzed in Pttg1 KO and WT fibrotic mice. Finally, Pttg1 silencing was evaluated in rats as a novel antifibrotic therapy.
Pttg1 and Dlk1 mRNA selectively increased in fibrotic rats paralleling fibrosis progression. Serum DLK1 concentrations correlated with hepatic collagen content and systemic and portal hemodynamics. Human cirrhotic livers showed greater PTTG1 and DLK1 transcript abundance than non-cirrhotic, and reduced collagen was observed in Pttg1 KO mice. The liver fibrotic molecular signature revealed lower expression of genes related to extracellular matrix remodeling including Mmp8 and 9 and Timp4 and greater eotaxin and Mmp13 than fibrotic WT mice. Finally, interfering Pttg1 resulted in reduced liver fibrotic area, lower α-2-Sma and decreased portal pressure than fibrotic animals. Furthermore, Pttg1 silencing decreased the transcription of Dlk1, collagens I and III, Pdgfβ, Tgfrβ, Timp1, Timp2, and Mmp2.
Pttg1/Dlk1 are selectively overexpressed in cirrhotic liver and participate in ECM turnover regulation. Pttg1 disruption decreases Dlk1 transcription and attenuates collagen deposition.

"The clinical course of patients experiencing recurrence following hepatectomy for colorectal cancer metastases (CRM) is poorly defined. Previous studies associated shorter time to recurrence (TTR) in months, node-positive primary tumor, and more than one site of recurrence with worse outcomes.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study across four Canadian institutions to externally validate previously established prognostic factors of overall survival (OS). We included consecutive adult patients who had a recurrence following curative-intent liver resection for CRM. Prognostic factors were explored using a multivariable Cox regression model. Risk group cutoffs were identified through recursive partitioning. OS between low- and high-risk groups was compared using the Kaplan-Meier method.
This study included 471 patients.

In this retrospective study, we reviewed 913 consecutive women who underwent a simple mastectomy for breast cancer between the years 2014 and 2019 and were treated either with same-day surgery (SDS) or an overnight stay (OS) regime. We reviewed all surgical complications, any unplanned return to care (RTC) and the rehospitalization rate for 30 postoperative days.
A total of 259 patients (28%) were treated with SDS and 654 patients (72%) with an OS regime.

"Capsular contracture is the most common complication with smooth-type silicone implants. We investigated the preventive effect of an active metabolite of tamoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OH TAM), on capsular contracture.
A silicone sheet was implanted into the back of 28 female ICR mice. Mixtures of gel with 0.2% 4-OH TAM and 0.1% 4-OH TAM were administered transdermally once a day for 4 weeks. Saline was administered to the control. After killing the mice, capsular thickness was measured in H&E-stained specimens. Estrogen receptor (ER), α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) expressions were immunohistochemically investigated in the capsules.
The capsule was thinner in the 0.2% 4-OH TAM gel group than in the control group (control, 0.1% 4-OH TAM gel, 0.2% 4-OH TAM gel: 52.8 ± 3.4 µm, 54.2 ± 6.8 µm, 46.4 ± 3.3 µm, respectively). ER was found in most fibroblasts of all samples. α-SMA expression in the capsule was significantly lower in the 4-OH TAM gel groups than in the control group (control = 70.0 ± 3.4%, 0.1% 4-OH TAM = 57.0 ± 3.4%, 0.2% 4-OH TAM = 49.4 ± 4.9%). TGF-β expression was significantly reduced by the 4-OH TAM gel injections dose-dependently (control = 67.3 ± 2.2%, 0.1% 4-OH TAM = 52.4 ± 3.1%, 0.2% 4-OH TAM = 45.1 ± 2.4%).
The transdermal administration of 0.1% and 0.2% 4-OH TAM gels inhibited capsule development. The inhibition of TGF-β expression is a mechanism by which 4-OH TAM suppresses fibroblast growth, preventing capsular formation.","['oh tam gels inhibited capsule development', 'oh tam suppresses fibroblast growth', 'oh tam gel injections dose', '28 female icr mice', 'oh tam gel groups', 'oh tam gel group', 'transforming growth factor', 'oh tam gel', 'oh tam gel', 'oh tam ),', 'type silicone implants', '8 ± 3', 'preventing capsular formation', 'smooth muscle actin', '2 ± 6', '0 ± 3', '0 ± 3', '3 ± 2', '4 ± 3', '4 ± 3', '2 %, 0', '4 %, 0', '4 %, 0', '1 %, 0', 'oh tam', 'oh tam', 'oh tam', 'oh tam', 'oh tam', 'oh tam', '1 ± 2', 'er ), α', '4 ± 4', '3 µm', 'sma ),', 'silicone sheet', '8 µm', 'capsular thickness', 'capsular contracture', 'capsular contracture', 'transdermal administration', 'stained specimens', 'sma expression', 'significantly reduced', 'significantly lower', 'respectively ).', 'preventive effect', 'estrogen receptor', 'control group', 'control group', 'common complication', 'active metabolite', '9 %).', '4 µm', '4 weeks', '4 %).', 'β expression', 'β expression', 'immunohistochemically investigated', 'administered transdermally', 'gel', 'capsule', 'capsule', 'mice', 'smooth', 'er', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '2', '2', '2', '2', '2', '2', 'α', 'α', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '4', '1', '1', '1', '1', '1', 'β', 'β', 'investigated', 'administered', 'control', 'control', 'control', 'control', 'thinner', 'tgf', 'tgf', 'tgf', 'tamoxifen', 'samples', 'saline', 'mixtures', 'mechanism', 'measured', 'killing', 'inhibition', 'implanted', 'hydroxytamoxifen', 'h', 'found', 'fibroblasts', 'expressions', 'e', 'dependently', 'day', 'capsules', 'back', '70', '67', '57', '54', '52', '52', '49', '46', '45']"
"Since the discovery of phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) enzyme overexpression in the central nervous system (CNS) malignancies, investigations have explored the potential capacity of current PDE5 inhibitor drugs for repositioning in the treatment of brain tumors, notably glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). It has now been recognized that these drugs increase brain tumors permeability and enhance standard chemotherapeutics effectiveness. More importantly, studies have highlighted the promising antitumor functions of PDE5 inhibitors, e.g., triggering apoptosis, suppressing tumor cell growth and invasion, and reversing tumor microenvironment (TME) immunosuppression in the brain. However, contradictory reports have suggested a pro-oncogenic role for neuronal cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), indicating the beneficial function of PDE5 in the brain of GBM patients. Unfortunately, due to the inconsistent preclinical findings, only a few clinical trials are evaluating the therapeutic value of PDE5 inhibitors in GBM treatment. Accordingly, additional studies should be conducted to shed light on the precise effect of PDE5 inhibitors in GBM biology regarding the existing molecular heterogeneities among individuals. Here, we highlighted and discussed the previously investigated mechanisms underlying the impacts of PDE5 inhibitors in cancers, focusing on GBM to provide an overview of current knowledge necessary for future studies.","['existing molecular heterogeneities among individuals', 'drugs increase brain tumors permeability', 'previously investigated mechanisms underlying', 'neuronal cyclic guanosine monophosphate', 'g ., triggering apoptosis', 'enhance standard chemotherapeutics effectiveness', 'suppressing tumor cell growth', 'current pde5 inhibitor drugs', 'reversing tumor microenvironment', 'current knowledge necessary', 'promising antitumor functions', 'notably glioblastoma multiforme', 'inconsistent preclinical findings', 'cgmp ), indicating', 'central nervous system', 'gbm biology regarding', 'brain tumors', 'therapeutic value', 'shed light', 'precise effect', 'potential capacity', 'pde5 inhibitors', 'pde5 inhibitors', 'pde5 inhibitors', 'pde5 inhibitors', 'oncogenic role', 'gbm patients', 'gbm ).', 'enzyme overexpression', 'contradictory reports', 'clinical trials', 'beneficial function', 'future studies', 'additional studies', 'gbm treatment', 'brain', 'brain', 'pde5', 'pde5', 'gbm', 'studies', 'treatment', 'unfortunately', 'tme', 'suggested', 'since', 'repositioning', 'recognized', 'provide', 'pro', 'phosphodiesterase', 'overview', 'malignancies', 'investigations', 'invasion', 'importantly', 'impacts', 'immunosuppression', 'however', 'highlighted', 'highlighted', 'focusing', 'explored', 'evaluating', 'e', 'due', 'discussed', 'discovery', 'conducted', 'cns', 'cancers', 'accordingly', '5']"
"Aberrant cell energy metabolism is one of the features of thyroid carcinogenesis. Metformin may reduce the risk of cancer, and BACH1 was reported to affect the sensitivity of cancer cells to metformin. The aims of this study were to investigate whether metformin exerts antitumor effects in PTC cells and explore the role of BACH1 depletion on the sensitivity of PTC cells to metformin.
The viability and proliferation of PTC cell lines were analyzed with MTT and colony forming assay. Energy utilization and mitochondrial respiration were measured using Seahorse XF instruments and Mitochondrial complex-1 activity assay.
Our results showed the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of metformin in PTC cells. Furthermore, metformin changed the pattern of cell energy metabolism in PTC cells, which manifested as inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, and the combination of BACH1 depletion with metformin magnified the effect of metformin alone.
In conclusion, metformin exerts an antitumoral effect on PTC cells both in vitro and in xenograft mouse models. A possible mechanism is through inhibiting glucose metabolism and mitochondrial respiration process. Knocking down BACH1 caused the switching of energy metabolism and sensitized PTC cells to metformin, which eventually enhanced the anti-tumor effect of metformin.","['investigate whether metformin exerts antitumor effects', 'measured using seahorse xf instruments', 'aberrant cell energy metabolism', 'cell energy metabolism', 'xenograft mouse models', 'inhibiting glucose metabolism', 'colony forming assay', '1 activity assay', 'ptc cell lines', 'metformin may reduce', 'mitochondrial respiration process', 'sensitized ptc cells', 'metformin exerts', 'apoptotic effects', 'energy metabolism', 'energy utilization', 'mitochondrial respiration', 'mitochondrial respiration', 'ptc cells', 'ptc cells', 'ptc cells', 'ptc cells', 'ptc cells', 'mitochondrial complex', 'thyroid carcinogenesis', 'results showed', 'possible mechanism', 'metformin magnified', 'metformin changed', 'metformin alone', 'eventually enhanced', 'bach1 depletion', 'bach1 depletion', 'bach1 caused', 'tumor effect', 'antitumoral effect', 'cancer cells', 'metformin', 'metformin', 'metformin', 'metformin', 'metformin', 'bach1', 'effect', 'cancer', 'vitro', 'viability', 'switching', 'study', 'sensitivity', 'sensitivity', 'role', 'risk', 'reported', 'proliferative', 'proliferation', 'pro', 'pattern', 'one', 'mtt', 'manifested', 'knocking', 'inhibition', 'furthermore', 'features', 'explore', 'conclusion', 'combination', 'anti', 'anti', 'analyzed', 'aims', 'affect']"
"Patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who experience poor clinical outcomes, including patients with obesity or prior treatment, need improved treatment options. Risankizumab specifically inhibits interleukin 23 and has demonstrated superior efficacy in active-comparator studies in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. We compared the efficacy of risankizumab with that of secukinumab across patient subgroups.
Subgroup analyses using data from the phase 3 IMMerge study (NCT03478787) were performed. Efficacy in adults with moderate-to-severe psoriasis treated with risankizumab 150 mg and secukinumab 300 mg was assessed as the proportion of patients who achieved ≥ 90% improvement in Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI 90) at week 52 across demographics and disease characteristics. Post hoc analyses evaluated the proportion of patients who achieved PASI 90 and the least-squares mean percent PASI improvement from baseline at week 52 by body weight and body mass index (BMI), PASI 90 by prior treatment, and clinical response [PASI 90, PASI 100, and/or static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA) score of clear (0) or almost clear (1)] at week 16 and maintained particular response at week 52. Logistic regression analyses examined the effect of covariates (age, sex, BMI, baseline PASI, treatment) and potential interactions on PASI 90 at week 52.
More patients who received risankizumab (n = 164) compared with secukinumab (n = 163) achieved PASI 90 at week 52, regardless of demographics and disease characteristics (BMI, prior treatment, disease duration, and maintenance of clinical response at week 52). Improvements in PASI were greater in patients taking risankizumab than those taking secukinumab, regardless of weight or BMI. Results from logistic regression analysis showed treatment type had a significant impact on PASI 90 (risankizumab versus secukinumab, p < 0.0001).
Risankizumab showed consistently greater efficacy compared with secukinumab across different patient subgroups, and this was maintained through 52 weeks.
ClinicalTrials.gov identifier; NCT03478787.
Patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis are often unable to achieve treatment success with currently available biologic therapies when they have other conditions, such as obesity, or have previous biologic therapy exposure and/or failure. We studied patients in the IMMerge phase 3 clinical trial (NCT03478787) to assess the efficacy of risankizumab compared with secukinumab for the treatment of plaque psoriasis and to determine risankizumab’s ability to remain effective after 52 weeks of administration. In our analysis, we looked across patient subgroups including patient body weight, body mass index, previous use of biologic therapies, length of time patients had been living with their disease, and the durability of risankizumab efficacy at 52 weeks. Results from our analysis showed that patients had greater success with risankizumab compared with secukinumab in treating their plaque psoriasis, despite their age, sex, race, and disease characteristics, and that risankizumab remained effective in treating plaque psoriasis at week 52. Previously reported safety results from the IMMerge clinical trial showed that there were no new concerns regarding side effects for either risankizumab or secukinumab. Overall, these results support the use of risankizumab to treat patients, including those who have other conditions or may not have had success with other therapies in treating their plaque psoriasis.","['looked across patient subgroups including patient body weight', 'logistic regression analysis showed treatment type', 'new concerns regarding side effects', 'secukinumab across different patient subgroups', 'risankizumab specifically inhibits interleukin 23', 'immerge phase 3 clinical trial', 'risankizumab showed consistently greater efficacy compared', 'squares mean percent pasi improvement', 'secukinumab across patient subgroups', 'logistic regression analyses examined', 'phase 3 immerge study', 'immerge clinical trial showed', 'subgroup analyses using data', 'post hoc analyses evaluated', 'experience poor clinical outcomes', 'need improved treatment options', 'previous biologic therapy exposure', 'psoriasis area severity index', 'previously reported safety results', 'currently available biologic therapies', 'week 52 across demographics', 'bmi ), pasi 90', 'body mass index', 'body mass index', 'severe psoriasis treated', 'risankizumab 150 mg', 'determine risankizumab ’', 'achieved ≥ 90', 'severe plaque psoriasis', 'severe plaque psoriasis', 'severe plaque psoriasis', 'secukinumab 300 mg', 'demonstrated superior efficacy', 'risankizumab remained effective', 'achieved pasi 90', 'achieved pasi 90', 'risankizumab versus secukinumab', 'body weight', 'achieve treatment success', 'analysis showed', 'maintained particular response', 'week 52 ).', 'treating plaque psoriasis', 'patients taking risankizumab', 'clinical response', 'clinical response', 'biologic therapies', 'plaque psoriasis', 'plaque psoriasis', 'plaque psoriasis', 'pasi 90', 'pasi 90', 'pasi 90', 'pasi 90', 'including patients', 'risankizumab compared', 'risankizumab compared', 'risankizumab efficacy', 'greater success', 'taking secukinumab', 'received risankizumab', 'either risankizumab', 'week 52', 'week 52', 'week 52', 'week 52', 'week 52', 'prior treatment', 'prior treatment', 'prior treatment', 'pasi 100', 'remain effective', 'previous use', '0001 ).', 'week 16', '52 weeks', '52 weeks', '52 weeks', 'baseline pasi', 'static physician', 'significant impact', 'results support', 'potential interactions', 'often unable', 'gov identifier', 'global assessment', 'comparator studies', '1 )]', 'disease duration', 'disease characteristics', 'disease characteristics', 'disease characteristics', 'weight', 'including', 'treat patients', 'time patients', 'studied patients', 'almost clear', 'improvement', 'greater', 'analysis', 'risankizumab', 'risankizumab', 'treatment', 'treatment', 'pasi', 'demographics', 'compared', 'compared', 'therapies', 'secukinumab', 'secukinumab', 'secukinumab', 'secukinumab', 'efficacy', 'efficacy', 'efficacy', 'success', 'results', 'results', 'maintained', 'disease', 'bmi', 'bmi', 'bmi', 'treating', 'treating', 'use', 'patients', 'patients', 'patients', 'patients', 'patients', 'patients', 'patients', 'clear', 'baseline', 'spga', 'sex', 'sex', 'score', 'regardless', 'regardless', 'race', 'proportion', 'proportion', 'performed', 'p', 'overall', 'obesity', 'obesity', 'nct03478787', 'nct03478787', 'nct03478787', 'n', 'n', 'moderate', 'moderate', 'moderate', 'moderate', 'may', 'maintenance', 'living', 'length', 'least', 'improvements', 'failure', 'effect', 'durability', 'despite', 'covariates', 'conditions', 'conditions', 'clinicaltrials', 'assessed', 'assess', 'age', 'age', 'adults', 'administration', 'active', 'ability', '164', '163', '0', '0']"
"A grading system for pulmonary adenocarcinoma has not been established; hence, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) pathology panel developed a new grading system for invasive adenocarcinoma. We aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of the IASLC grading system for invasive pulmonary adenocarcinoma.
We conducted a retrospective analysis of 471 Japanese patients with resected lung adenocarcinoma. Tumors were classified in accordance with the IASLC grading system and 2015 World Health Organization classification. We analyzed recurrence-free probability (RFP) and overall survival (OS) using the log-rank test and compared the two grading systems using the Cox proportional hazards model.
Grade 3 tumors of the IASLC system and high-grade tumors of the 2015 World Health Organization classification were present in 38% and 17% of patients, respectively. The 5-year RFP was lower in patients with IASLC Grade 3 tumors (45%) than in patients with IASLC Grade 1 and 2 tumors (91% and 83%, respectively). The 5-year RFP of patients with IASLC Grade 2 tumors (83%) was higher than of those with 2015 World Health Organization intermediate tumors (69%). On multivariate analysis for recurrence, IASLC Grade 3 was an independent prognostic factor of worse RFP. We showed similar results on analysis for the OS.
The prognostic significance of IASLC Grade 3 tumors on recurrence-free probability was confirmed through both univariate and multivariate analyses. Thus, the IASLC Grade 3 tumor is an independent factor of poor prognosis in patients with resected lung adenocarcinoma.","['2015 world health organization intermediate tumors', '2015 world health organization classification', '2015 world health organization classification', 'cox proportional hazards model', 'iaslc grade 3 tumor', 'two grading systems using', '83 %, respectively ).', 'iaslc grade 3 tumors', 'iaslc grade 3 tumors', 'iaslc grade 2 tumors', 'grade 3 tumors', 'iaslc grade 3', 'iaslc grade 1', 'showed similar results', 'pathology panel developed', 'iaslc grading system', 'iaslc grading system', 'new grading system', 'resected lung adenocarcinoma', 'resected lung adenocarcinoma', 'invasive pulmonary adenocarcinoma', 'independent prognostic factor', '471 japanese patients', 'grade tumors', '2 tumors', 'iaslc system', 'grading system', 'pulmonary adenocarcinoma', 'invasive adenocarcinoma', 'independent factor', '83 %)', 'lung cancer', 'prognostic significance', 'prognostic significance', 'rank test', 'poor prognosis', 'overall survival', 'multivariate analyses', 'international association', 'free probability', 'free probability', '69 %).', '45 %)', 'year rfp', 'year rfp', 'worse rfp', 'retrospective analysis', 'multivariate analysis', 'analyzed recurrence', 'tumors', 'iaslc', 'using', 'respectively', 'rfp', 'analysis', 'recurrence', 'recurrence', 'patients', 'patients', 'patients', 'patients', 'patients', 'univariate', 'thus', 'study', 'present', 'os', 'os', 'lower', 'log', 'higher', 'high', 'hence', 'evaluate', 'established', 'confirmed', 'conducted', 'compared', 'classified', 'aimed', 'accordance', '91', '5', '5', '38', '17']"
"Gastric cancer (GC) is an aggressive malignancy with high incidence and mortality. Radiotherapy is a common treatment for patients with advanced GC. Many long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been verified to affect the radiosensitivity of multiple cancers in previous studies. Nevertheless, whether lncRNA opioid growth factor receptor pseudogene 1 (OGFRP1) affects the radiosensitivity of GC has not been determined. We hypothesized that OGFRP1 might affect cellular processes in GC development. The present study aims to explore the role of OGFRP1 in GC development. First, high expression of OGFRP1 in GC tissues and cells was determined through RT-qPCR. Subsequently, functional assays including colony formation assays, 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine assays and flow cytometry analyses were performed to probe the biological functions of OGFRP1 in GC. Specifically, the effect of OGFRP1 on the radiosensitivity of GC cells was detected. Subsequently, with the help of the starBase tool, we found that miR-149-5p might bind to OGFRP1, which was confirmed through a luciferase reporter assay. Furthermore, we identified that MAP3K3 was targeted by miR-149-5p in GC cells. Finally, the results from rescue experiments validated that enhanced MAP3K3 expression counteracted the effect of OGFRP1 silencing on GC cell proliferation, apoptosis and radiosensitivity.

"Metastasis is responsible for most of the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-associated death. However, its underlying mechanism has yet to be fully elucidated. Glycolysis-derived lactate has been shown to be a powerful regulator of cancer metastasis. Heat shock protein A12A (HSPA12A) encodes a novel member of HSP70 family. We have recently demonstrated that heat shock protein A12A (HSPA12A) inhibited renal cancer cell migration by suppressing lactate output and glycolytic activity, which were mediated by unstabilizing CD147 and promoting its degradation. By striking contrast, here we demonstrated that HSPA12A promoted migration of human HCC cells. Extracellular acidification, lactate export, and glycolytic activity in HCC cells were also promoted following HSPA12A overexpression. Further analysis revealed that HSPA12A interacted with MCT4 and increased its membrane localization, thereby promoting export of lactate generated from glycolysis; this led, ultimately, to HCC cell migration. Our results revealed the opposite effect of HSPA12A on migration of renal cancer cells and that of HCC cells. Of note, in contrast to the inhibitory effect on CD147 expression in renal cancer cells, we found that HSPA12A increased CD147 expression in HCC cells, indicating that the expression of CD147 might exist heterogeneity in different cancer cell types. Taken together, we identified HSPA12A as an activator of HCC migration, a role opposite to that of renal cancer cells. Inhibiting HSPA12A might be a potential therapeutic intervention for HCC metastasis.","['also promoted following hspa12a overexpression', 'inhibited renal cancer cell migration', 'heat shock protein a12a', 'heat shock protein a12a', 'different cancer cell types', 'hcc )- associated death', 'cd147 might exist heterogeneity', 'hspa12a increased cd147 expression', 'renal cancer cells', 'renal cancer cells', 'renal cancer cells', 'hcc cell migration', 'hspa12a promoted migration', 'potential therapeutic intervention', 'inhibiting hspa12a might', 'suppressing lactate output', 'human hcc cells', 'thereby promoting export', 'cd147 expression', 'hcc migration', 'hcc cells', 'hcc cells', 'hcc cells', 'unstabilizing cd147', 'cancer metastasis', 'lactate export', 'identified hspa12a', 'hspa12a interacted', 'lactate generated', 'derived lactate', 'hcc metastasis', 'underlying mechanism', 'taken together', 'role opposite', 'results revealed', 'powerful regulator', 'opposite effect', 'novel member', 'membrane localization', 'inhibitory effect', 'hsp70 family', 'hepatocellular carcinoma', 'glycolytic activity', 'glycolytic activity', 'fully elucidated', 'extracellular acidification', 'analysis revealed', 'striking contrast', 'recently demonstrated', 'migration', 'increased', 'hspa12a', 'hspa12a', 'hspa12a', 'expression', 'promoting', 'metastasis', 'demonstrated', 'contrast', 'yet', 'ultimately', 'shown', 'responsible', 'note', 'mediated', 'mct4', 'led', 'indicating', 'however', 'glycolysis', 'glycolysis', 'found', 'encodes', 'degradation', 'activator']"

"In the phase 3 GRID trial, regorafenib improved progression-free survival (PFS) independent of KIT mutations in exons 9 and 11. In this retrospective, exploratory analysis of the GRID trial, we investigated whether a more comprehensive KIT mutation analysis could identify mutations that impact treatment outcome with regorafenib and a regorafenib-induced mutation pattern.
Archived tumor samples, collected at any time prior to enrollment in GRID, were analyzed by Sanger sequencing (n = 102) and next-generation sequencing (FoundationONE; n = 47). Plasma samples collected at baseline were analyzed by BEAMing (n = 163) and SafeSEQ (n = 96).
In archived tumor samples, 67% (68/102) had a KIT mutation; 61% (62/102) had primary KIT mutations (exons 9 and 11) and 12% (12/102) had secondary mutations (exons 13, 14, 17, and 18). At baseline, 81% of samples (78/96) had KIT mutations by SafeSEQ, including the M541L polymorphism (sole event in 6 patients). Coexisting mutations in other oncogenes were rare, as were mutations in PDGFR, KRAS, and BRAF. Regorafenib showed PFS benefit across all primary and secondary KIT mutational subgroups examined. Available patient-matched samples taken at baseline and end of treatment (n = 41; SafeSEQ), revealed heterogeneous KIT mutational changes with no specific mutation pattern emerging upon regorafenib treatment.
These data support the results of the GRID trial, and suggest that patients may benefit from regorafenib in the presence of KIT mutations and without the selection of particular mutation patterns that confer resistance.

"The standard treatment for unresectable advanced/recurrent esophageal cancer in Japan is 5-fluorouracil plus platinum-containing drugs as first-line chemotherapy and taxanes as second-line chemotherapy. However, the standard regimen after patients become refractory to these treatments remains to be established. Therefore, we investigated the efficacy of trifluridine/tipiracil (FTD/TPI) in patients with esophageal cancer who are refractory or intolerant to 5-fluorouracil, platinum-containing drugs, and taxanes.
This single-arm phase II trial was conducted in seven hospitals in Japan. Eligible patients were those with unresectable advanced/recurrent esophageal cancer that was refractory or intolerant to 5-fluorouracil, platinum-containing drugs, and taxanes. The primary endpoint was the 3-month progression-free survival rate, and the secondary endpoints were the 6-month progression-free survival rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, response rate, disease control rate, and toxicity.
Forty-two patients were enrolled between October 2015 and June 2016. All tumors were squamous cell carcinomas. The progression-free survival rates at 3 and 6 months were 15.4% (90% confidence interval 7.4-26.0%) and 7.7% (90% confidence interval 2.6-16.6%), respectively. The median progression-free survival and median overall survival were 1.3 (95% confidence interval 1.0-1.8) months and 4.5 (95% confidence interval 3.6-5.7) months, respectively. The response rate was 0%, and the disease control rate was 23.8% (95% confidence interval 13.5-38.5%). The major grade 3/4 toxicities were neutropenia (47.6%), leukocytopenia (35.7%), and anemia (21.4%). No treatment-related deaths occurred.

"Transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) is the most recent approach developed to improve pelvic dissection in surgery for mid and low rectal tumors. There are still inconsistencies regarding the technique's oncological results. The aim of this study was to analyze clinical and oncological outcomes of the learning curve of TaTME in comparison to laparoscopic TME (lapTME).
Rectal cancer patients who had TaTME and lapTME in two Portuguese colorectal units between March 2016 and December 2018 were eligible. Primary endpoints were 5-year overall survival, disease-free survival, and local recurrence. Secondary endpoints were clinical and pathological outcomes.
Forty-four patients underwent TaTME (29 men) and 39 lapTME (27 men) with a median age of 69 and 66 (p = 0.093), respectively. No differences were observed concerning baseline characteristics, emphasizing their comparability. In the TaTME group, there were more hand-sewn anastomosis (0 lapTME versus 7 TaTME, p = 0.018) with significantly less distance to the dentate line (40 mm lapTME versus 20 mm TaTME, p = 0.005) and significantly more loop ileostomies performed (28 lapTME versus 41 TaTME, p = 0.001). There were no differences in post-operative mortality, morbidity, readmissions, and stoma closure. Groups were similar in relation to specimen quality, margins, and resectability; however, TaTME had a significantly higher node yield (14 lapTME versus 20 TaTME, p = 0.002). Finally, no disparities were noted in oncological outcomes, namely local and distant recurrence, 5-year overall survival, and disease-free survival.
Even with the disadvantage of the learning curve of a new technique, TaTME appears to be comparable to lapTME, with similar long-term oncological outcomes.

"The genes miR-4510 and glypican-3 (GPC3) have reported to be closely associated with tumors, with miR-4510 inversely correlated with GPC3 mRNA and protein in hepatocellular carcinoma samples. Glypican-3-expressing gastric cancer (GPC3-GC), characterized as gastric cancer (GC) expressing GPC3, accounts for 11% of the GC cases. However, the expression and mechanism of action of miR-4510 in GPC3-GC have not been clearly defined. We found that miR-4510 expression in GC tissues was significantly lower than that in the adjacent tissues (p < 0.001). miRNA-4510 expression in GPC3-GC was significantly lower than that in GPC3-negative GC tissue (p < 0.001). Our study confirmed that miR-4510 is inversely correlated with GPC3 in gastric cancer samples and that GPC3 is a direct target gene of miR-4510. The proportion of M2 macrophages in GC with low expression of miR-4510 was significantly increased, while the proliferation of CD8+ T cells was limited. miR-4510 may change the immunosuppressive signals in the tumor microenvironment by downregulating GPC3 and inhibiting gastric cancer cell metastasis.

"The deregulation of circular RNAs (circRNAs) is involved in cancer development. CircRNA polo-like kinase 1 (circPLK1) was reported to promote breast cancer development. However, the role of circPLK1 in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is unclear. The expression of circPLK1, miR-1294, and high mobility group AT-hook 1 (HMGA1) mRNA was measured by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Cell viability was detected by CCK-8 assay. Colony formation ability was monitored by colony formation assay. Cell proliferation was detected by EdU assay. Cell migration and cell invasion were monitored by transwell assay. Cancer cell stemness was investigated by sphere formation assay. The protein levels of marker proteins and HMGA1 expression were measured by western blot analysis. The binding relationship between miR-1294 and circPLK1 or HMGA1 was validated by pull-down assay, dual-luciferase reporter assay or RIP assy. Animal study was performed to disclose the role of circPLK1 in vivo. Exosomes were identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). CircPLK1 was upregulated in MPM tumor tissues and cell lines. CircPLK1 knockdown suppressed the proliferation, migration, invasion and stemness of MPM cells. CircPLK1 contained a binding site for miR-1294 and thus bound to miR-1294 to sequester its expression. Inhibition of miR-1294 reversed the effects of circPLK1 knockdown. HMGA1 was a target of miR-1294, and circPLK1 bound to miR-1294 to increase the expression of HMGA1. MiR-1294 restoration also suppressed the proliferation, migration, invasion and stemness of MPM cells, while these effects were abolished by HMGA1 overexpression. In addition, circPLK1 knockdown inhibited tumor growth in vivo. CircPLK1 was overexpressed in exosomes derived from serum of MPM patients.

"To determine the geographic distribution of muscle-invasive bladder cancer mortality according to race in the United States (US). African Americans (AAs) have up to two times the risk of bladder cancer mortality compared to Caucasians. Bladder cancer mortality increases exponentially once it invades the muscle. Geographic heterogeneity in bladder cancer mortality according to race remains to be determined.
Analysis of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data for 6,044 patients aged 66-85 diagnosed with clinical stage T2-T4 N0M0 bladder cancer from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2011. Fine and Gray-competing risks regression models were used to assess the association of race with bladder cancer-specific mortality (BCSM) according to tumor registry.
Out of 6,044 patients, 5,408 (89.5%) were Caucasian, 352 (5.82%) were non-Hispanic AA, 85 (1.4%) were Hispanic, and 199 (3.29%) were other. Of the 18 registries, AAs with bladder cancer were largely concentrated in Louisiana (19%), New Jersey (17.9%), and Georgia (17.6%). New Jersey was the only registry where AAs had increased risk of BCSM than Caucasians and only for stage T2 disease: (AHR, 1.74; 95% CI 1.22-2.47, p = 0.002).

Molecular imaging is a promising diagnostic method for noninvasive imaging of biological events at the cellular and molecular level in vivo. Molecular imaging plays a key role in the early diagnosis, staging, and treatment-related evaluation and management of cancer.

"To develop a multiparametric MRI-based radiomics nomogram for predicting lymphovascular invasion (LVI) status and clinical outcomes in patients with breast invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC).
A total of 160 patients with pathologically confirmed breast IDC (training cohort: n = 112; validation cohort: n = 48) who underwent preoperative breast MRI were included. Imaging features were extracted from T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (cT1WI) sequences. A four-step procedure was applied for feature selection and radiomics signature building. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the features associated with LVI, which were then incorporated into the radiomics nomogram. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by its discrimination, calibration, and clinical usefulness. Kaplan-Meier survival curves based on the two radiomics models were used to estimate disease-free survival (DFS).
The fusion radiomics signature of the T2WI, cT1WI, and ADC maps achieved a better predictive efficacy for LVI than either of them alone. The proposed radiomics nomogram, incorporating the fusion radiomics signature and MRI-reported peritumoral edema, showed satisfactory capabilities of calibration and discrimination in both training and validation datasets, with AUCs of 0.919 (95% CI: 0.871-0.967) and 0.863 (95% CI: 0.726-0.999), respectively. The radiomics signature and nomogram-defined high-risk groups had a shorter DFS than those in the low-risk groups (both p < 0.05). Higher Rad-scores were independently associated with a worse DFS in the whole cohort (p < 0.05).
The proposed nomogram, incorporating multiparametric MRI-based radiomics signature and MRI-reported peritumoral edema, achieved a satisfactory preoperative prediction of LVI and clinical outcomes in IDC patients.

"To evaluate the incidence of vesicovaginal fistula (VVF) in France.
We conducted a retrospective analysis of prospectively and systematically collected data from January 2010 to December 2018 in the French Hospital Discharge Database. We used ICD-10 code ""N820"" to identify new VVF diagnoses. VVF incidence was calculated using estimations of the French population. We compared age on diagnosis, medical history of pelvic tumoral disease, radiotherapy, hysterectomy and childbirth, according to three subgroups: surgical repair attempt (SRA), long-term catheter and/or nephrostomies (LTC) or immediate surgical urinary diversion (ISUD). We focused on the patients diagnosed in 2017 to better analyse VVF aetiologies and outcomes (7-year hindsight and 1 year of follow-up). Chi-squared and Kruskal-Wallis tests were, respectively, used for qualitative and quantitative data comparisons.
Of the 196 million hospital stays out of 50 million French citizens hospitalised from 2010 to 2018, 5499 women were hospitalised for VVF. The estimated incidence of VVF was 2.3/100,000 women-year. Approximately half of the patients underwent SRA (48.4%); 39.8% had LTC and 11.9% had ISUD. Patients were younger in the SRA subgroup (53.4 ± 14.7 years p < 0.001) with a lower rate of pelvic cancer (p < 0.001) or radiotherapy (p < 0.001) and a higher rate of hysterectomies (p > 0.001). In 2017, two-thirds of the VVF diagnosed were secondary to pelvic surgery. Mean management time was 9.2 ± 10.6 months.

"The standard treatment of stage II-III rectal cancer is preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT), followed by total mesorectal excision (TME). However, the rate of metastasis is still high following this treatment. Therefore, several adjuvant chemotherapy studies have been conducted on reducing subsequent metastases and increasing survival, although there are still no definite conclusions.
We searched for published prospective randomized controlled trials comparing adjuvant chemotherapy regimens following standard preoperative CRT and curative surgery in stage II-III rectal cancer. We systematically searched Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for relevant trials done from January 2004 to January 2021. Review Manager (RevMan, version 5.3) was used to analyze the data.
We initially searched 1955 studies. We screened and carefully selected four randomized controlled trials with 2897 patients. Compared to the 5-FU-based regimen group, the oxaliplatin-added regimen group attained a higher 3-year locoregional control rate (relative risk [RR] of 0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-0.86; p = 0.003) and 3-year distant metastasis control rate (RR of 0.82, 95% CI, 0.71-0.95; p = 0.007). The oxaliplatin-added regimen group had significantly increased 3-year disease-free survival with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.74-0.97, p = 0.020), but not overall survival (p = 0.740). Grade 3 or higher acute toxicity rates did not differ between the two groups (p = 0.190).
The addition of oxaliplatin to adjuvant therapy for stage II-III rectal cancer following preoperative CRT and TME may increase disease-free survival without significant increases in toxicity, but not overall survival.","['published prospective randomized controlled trials comparing adjuvant chemotherapy regimens following standard preoperative crt', 'carefully selected four randomized controlled trials', 'iii rectal cancer following preoperative crt', 'several adjuvant chemotherapy studies', 'free survival without significant increases', 'year distant metastasis control rate', 'year locoregional control rate', 'initially searched 1955 studies', 'added regimen group attained', 'tme may increase disease', 'higher acute toxicity rates', 'relevant trials done', 'crt ), followed', 'still high following', 'iii rectal cancer', 'iii rectal cancer', 'added regimen group', 'based regimen group', 'total mesorectal excision', 'standard treatment', 'reducing subsequent metastases', 'preoperative chemoradiotherapy', 'systematically searched medline', 'adjuvant therapy', 'significantly increased 3', 'year disease', 'free survival', 'ci ], 0', 'tme ).', 'higher 3', 'overall survival', 'overall survival', 'increasing survival', '020 ),', 'two groups', 'stage ii', 'stage ii', 'stage ii', 'review manager', 'relative risk', 'january 2021', 'january 2004', 'hazard ratio', 'definite conclusions', 'curative surgery', 'confidence interval', 'cochrane library', '740 ).', '2897 patients', '190 ).', '007 ).', 'grade 3', 'version 5', 'rate', 'metastasis', 'searched', 'toxicity', 'still', '3', '3', 'ci', 'ci', 'treatment', '5', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'used', 'therefore', 'screened', 'rr', 'rr', 'revman', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'oxaliplatin', 'oxaliplatin', 'oxaliplatin', 'hr', 'however', 'fu', 'embase', 'differ', 'data', 'conducted', 'compared', 'analyze', 'although', 'addition', '97', '95', '95', '95', '95', '86', '85', '82', '74', '71', '64', '48', '003']"

"Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) occur in up to 30% of patients undergoing surgery and are a significant contributor to the overall risk of surgery. A preoperative risk prediction tool for postoperative pulmonary complications could succour clinical identification of patients at increased risk and support clinical decision making. This original study aimed to externally validate a risk model for predicting postoperative pulmonary complications (ARISCAT) in a cohort of patients undergoing major emergency abdominal surgery at a Danish University Hospital.
ARISCAT was validated prospectively in a cohort of patients undergoing major emergency abdominal surgery between March 2017 and January 2019. Predicted PPCs by ARISCAT were compared with observed PPCs. ARISCAT was validated with calibration, discrimination and accuracy and in adherence to the TRIPOD statement.
The study included a total of 585 patients with a median age of 70 years. The majority of patients underwent emergency laparotomy without bowel resection. The predicted PPC frequency by ARISCAT was 24.9%, while the observed frequency of PPCs in the cohort was 36.1%. The slope of the calibration plot was 0.9546, the y axis interception was 0.1269 and the plot was well fitted to a linear slope. The Hosmer Lemeshow goodness-of-fit analysis showed good calibration (p > 0.25). ARISCAT showed good discrimination with AUC 0.83 (95% CI 0.79-0.86) on a receiver-operating characteristics curve and the accuracy was also good with a Brier score of 0.19.

"The primary aim was to assess associations between total steps per day and incident diabetes, whereas the secondary aim was to assess whether the intensity and/or cadence of steps is associated with incident diabetes.
Women without physician-diagnosed diabetes (n = 4,838; mean [SD] age 78.9 [6.7] years) were followed up to 6.9 years; 395 developed diabetes. Hip-worn ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometers worn for 1 week enabled measures of total, light-intensity, and moderate- to vigorous-intensity (MV-intensity) steps per day. Using Cox proportional hazards analysis we modeled adjusted change in the hazard rate for incident diabetes associated with total, light-intensity, and MV-intensity steps per day. We further estimated the proportion of the steps-diabetes association mediated by BMI.
On average, participants took 3,729 (SD 2,114) steps/day, of which 1,875 (791) were light-intensity steps and 1,854 ± 1,762 were MV-intensity. More steps per day were associated with a lower hazard rate for incident diabetes. Confounder-adjusted models for a 2,000 steps/day increment yielded hazard ratio (HR) 0.88 (95% CI 0.78-1.00; P = 0.046). After further adjustment for BMI, HR was 0.90 (95% CI 0.80-1.02; P = 0.11). BMI did not significantly mediate the steps-diabetes association (proportion mediated = 17.7% [95% CI -55.0 to 142.0]; P = 0.09]). The relationship between MV-intensity steps per day (HR 0.86 [95% CI 0.74-1.00]; P = 0.04) and incident diabetes was stronger than for light-intensity steps per day (HR 0.97 [95% CI 0.73-1.29]; P = 0.84).
These findings suggest that for older adults, more steps per day are associated with lower incident diabetes and MV-intensity steps are most strongly associated with a lower hazard of diabetes. This evidence supports that regular stepping is an important risk factor for type 2 diabetes prevention in older adults.","['using cox proportional hazards analysis', 'day increment yielded hazard ratio', '1 week enabled measures', 'type 2 diabetes prevention', 'total steps per day', 'intensity steps per day', 'intensity steps per day', 'intensity steps per day', 'steps per day', 'steps per day', 'steps per day', 'women without physician', 'participants took 3', 'important risk factor', 'worn actigraph gt3x', 'modeled adjusted change', '395 developed diabetes', '29 ]; p', 'lower hazard rate', '854 ± 1', 'lower incident diabetes', 'diabetes association mediated', '00 ]; p', '0 ]; p', 'incident diabetes associated', 'lower hazard', 'hazard rate', 'diabetes association', 'incident diabetes', 'incident diabetes', 'incident diabetes', 'incident diabetes', 'intensity steps', 'intensity steps', 'adjusted models', 'accelerometers worn', '000 steps', 'diagnosed diabetes', 'significantly mediate', 'secondary aim', 'regular stepping', 'proportion mediated', 'primary aim', 'older adults', 'older adults', 'findings suggest', 'evidence supports', 'assess whether', 'assess associations', '84 ).', '11 ).', '09 ]).', '046 ).', 'sd 2', 'strongly associated', 'age 78', 'day', 'ci 0', 'ci 0', 'ci 0', 'ci 0', 'hr 0', 'hr 0', '9 years', 'steps', 'steps', 'steps', 'steps', 'diabetes', '2', 'p', 'p', 'total', 'total', 'intensity', 'intensity', 'intensity', 'intensity', 'intensity', 'intensity', '00', 'ci', '1', '1', '1', '1', '1', '1', 'associated', 'associated', 'associated', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'years', 'sd', 'proportion', 'hr', 'hr', '9', '78', 'whereas', 'vigorous', 'stronger', 'relationship', 'n', 'mv', 'mv', 'mv', 'mv', 'mv', 'moderate', 'mean', 'light', 'light', 'light', 'light', 'hip', 'followed', 'estimated', 'confounder', 'cadence', 'bmi', 'bmi', 'bmi', 'average', 'adjustment', '97', '95', '95', '95', '95', '95', '90', '88', '875', '86', '838', '80', '791', '762', '74', '73', '729', '7', '7', '6', '6', '55', '4', '17', '142', '114', '04', '02']"
"Aging is associated with a decline in mitochondrial function and reduced exercise capacity. Urolithin A is a natural gut microbiome-derived food metabolite that has been shown to stimulate mitophagy and improve muscle function in older animals and to induce mitochondrial gene expression in older humans.
To investigate whether oral administration of urolithin A improved the 6-minute walk distance, muscle endurance in hand and leg muscles, and biomarkers associated with mitochondrial and cellular health.
This double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial in adults aged 65 to 90 years was conducted at a medical center and a cancer research center in Seattle, Washington, from March 1, 2018, to July 30, 2020. Muscle fatigue tests and plasma analysis of biomarkers were assessed at baseline, 2 months, and 4 months. Six-minute walk distance and maximal ATP production were assessed using magnetic resonance spectroscopy at baseline and at the end of study at 4 months. The analysis used an intention-to-treat approach.
Participants were randomized to receive daily oral supplementation with either 1000 mg urolithin A or placebo for 4 months.
The primary end point was change from baseline in the 6-minute walk distance and change from baseline to 4 months in maximal ATP production in the hand skeletal muscle. The secondary end points were change in muscle endurance of 2 skeletal muscles (tibialis anterior [TA] in the leg and first dorsal interosseus [FDI] in the hand). Cellular health biomarkers were investigated via plasma metabolomics. Adverse events were recorded and compared between the 2 groups during the intervention period.
A total of 66 participants were randomized to either the urolithin A (n = 33) or the placebo (n = 33) intervention group. These participants had a mean (SD) age of 71.7 (4.94) years, were predominantly women (50 [75.8%]), and were all White individuals. Urolithin A, compared with placebo, significantly improved muscle endurance (ie, increase in the number of muscle contractions until fatigue from baseline) in the FDI and TA at 2 months (urolithin A: FDI, 95.3 [115.5] and TA, 41.4 [65.5]; placebo: FDI, 11.6 [147.4] and TA, 5.7 [127.1]). Plasma levels of several acylcarnitines, ceramides, and C-reactive protein were decreased by urolithin A, compared with placebo, at 4 months (baseline vs 4 mo: urolithin A, 2.14 [2.15] vs 2.07 [1.46]; placebo, 2.17 [2.52] vs 2.65 [1.86]). The mean (SD) increase from baseline in the 6-minute walk distance was 60.8 (67.2) m in the urolithin A group and 42.5 (73.3) m in the placebo group. The mean (SD) change from baseline to 4 months in maximal ATP production in the FDI was 0.07 (0.23) mM/s in the urolithin A group and 0.06 (0.20) mM/s in the placebo group; for the TA, it was -0.03 (0.10) mM/s in the urolithin A group and 0.03 (0.10) mM/s in the placebo group. These results showed no significant improvement with urolithin A supplementation compared with placebo. No statistical differences in adverse events were observed between the 2 groups.
This randomized clinical trial found that urolithin A supplementation was safe and well tolerated in the assessed population. Although the improvements in the 6-minute walk distance and maximal ATP production in the hand muscle were not significant in the urolithin A group vs the placebo group, long-term urolithin A supplementation was beneficial for muscle endurance and plasma biomarkers, suggesting that urolithin A may counteract age-associated muscle decline; however, future work is needed to confirm this finding.

"Racial and ethnic differences in lung cancer screening (LCS) completion and follow-up may be associated with lung cancer incidence and mortality rates among high-risk populations. Aggregation of Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander racial and ethnic groups may mask the true underlying disparities in screening uptake and diagnostic follow-up, creating barriers for targeted, preventive health care.
To examine racial and ethnic differences in LCS completion and follow-up rates in a multiethnic population.
This population-based cohort study was conducted at a health maintenance organization in Hawaii. LCS program participants were identified using electronic medical records from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2019. Study eligibility requirements included being aged 55 to 79 years, a 30 pack-year smoking history, a current smoker or having quit within the past 15 years, at least 5 years past any lung cancer diagnosis and treatment, and cancer free. Data analysis was performed from June 2019 to October 2020.
Eligible for LCS.
Screening rates were analyzed by self-reported race and ethnicity and completion of a low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) test. Diagnostic follow-up results were based on the Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) staging system.
A total of 1030 eligible LCS program members had an order placed; their mean (SD) age was 65.5 (5.8) years, and 633 (61%) were men. The largest racial and ethnic groups were non-Hispanic White (381 participants [37.0%]), Native Hawaiian or part Native Hawaiian (186 participants [18.1%]), and Japanese (146 participants [14.2%]). Men and Filipino, Chinese, Japanese, and non-Hispanic White individuals had a higher proportion of screen orders for LDCT compared with women and individuals of the other racial and ethnic groups. The overall LCS completion rate was 81% (838 participants). There was a 14% to 15% screening completion rate gap among groups. Asian individuals had the highest screening completion rate (266 participants [86%]) followed by Native Hawaiian (149 participants [80%]) and non-Hispanic White individuals (305 participants [80%]), Pacific Islander (50 participants [79%]) individuals, and individuals of other racial and ethnic groups (68 participants [77%]). Within Asian subgroups, Korean (31 participants [94%]) and Japanese (129 participants [88%]) individuals had the highest completion rates followed by Chinese individuals (28 participants [82%]) and Filipino individuals (78 participants [79%]). Of the 54 participants with Lung-RADS stage 3 disease, 93% (50 participants) completed a 6-month surveillance LDCT test; of 37 individuals with Lung-RADS stage 4 disease, 35 (97%) were followed-up for additional procedures.
This cohort study found racial and ethnic disparities in LCS completion rates after disaggregation of Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and Asian individuals and their subgroups. These findings suggest that future research is needed to understand factors that may be associated with LCS completion and follow-up behaviors among these racial and ethnic groups.","['identified using electronic medical records', 'screening completion rate gap among groups', '1030 eligible lcs program members', 'study eligibility requirements included', 'highest screening completion rate', 'rads stage 4 disease', 'rads stage 3 disease', 'mortality rates among high', 'overall lcs completion rate', 'cohort study found racial', 'month surveillance ldct test', '0 %]), native hawaiian', 'highest completion rates followed', '80 %]), pacific islander', 'least 5 years past', 'ethnic groups may mask', 'based cohort study', 'year smoking history', 'preventive health care', 'health maintenance organization', 'dose computed tomography', 'lcs program participants', 'true underlying disparities', 'lcs completion rates', 'lung cancer screening', 'part native hawaiian', '86 %]) followed', 'lung imaging reporting', '838 participants ).', 'past 15 years', 'lung cancer incidence', 'lung cancer diagnosis', 'pacific islander racial', '88 %]) individuals', 'hispanic white individuals', 'hispanic white individuals', '79 %]) individuals', 'within asian subgroups', 'screening rates', 'pacific islander', 'behaviors among', 'lcs completion', 'lcs completion', '80 %])', 'screening uptake', '1 %]),', 'hispanic white', 'ethnic groups', 'ethnic groups', 'ethnic groups', 'ethnic groups', 'native hawaiian', 'native hawaiian', 'native hawaiian', '79 years', 'ethnic disparities', 'cancer free', 'quit within', '94 %])', '82 %])', 'asian individuals', 'asian individuals', 'ldct compared', '79 %]).', 'ethnic differences', 'ethnic differences', 'asian american', '78 participants', '68 participants', '54 participants', '50 participants', '50 participants', '381 participants', '31 participants', '305 participants', '28 participants', '266 participants', '186 participants', '149 participants', '146 participants', '129 participants', 'understand factors', 'staging system', 'screen orders', 'risk populations', 'reported race', 'order placed', 'october 2020', 'january 1', 'higher proportion', 'future research', 'findings suggest', 'december 31', 'data system', 'data analysis', 'current smoker', 'creating barriers', 'aged 55', 'additional procedures', '97 %)', '77 %]).', '61 %)', '30 pack', '2 %]).', 'largest racial', 'examine racial', 'filipino individuals', 'chinese individuals', '37 individuals', 'multiethnic population', 'june 2019', 'diagnostic follow', 'diagnostic follow', 'rads', 'eligible', 'completion', 'completion', 'rates', 'followed', 'lcs', 'lcs', 'years', 'test', 'ldct', 'individuals', 'individuals', 'lung', 'lung', 'lung', 'subgroups', 'may', 'may', 'based', '5', '5', '15', 'racial', 'racial', 'racial', 'racial', 'population', 'filipino', 'chinese', '37', '2019', 'follow', 'follow', 'follow', 'women', 'treatment', 'total', 'targeted', 'self', 'sd', 'results', 'performed', 'non', 'non', 'non', 'needed', 'men', 'men', 'mean', 'low', 'korean', 'japanese', 'japanese', 'japanese', 'hawaii', 'ethnicity', 'disaggregation', 'conducted', 'completed', 'associated', 'associated', 'analyzed', 'aggregation', 'age', '93', '81', '8', '65', '633', '6', '35', '2015', '18', '14', '14']"
"Neoadjuvant immunotherapy is a novel approach with the potential to improve outcomes for patients with oral cavity squamous cell cancer (OCSCC). Adverse events of varying severity are reported with immunotherapy, and a biomarker to predict response would be clinically useful to avoid toxic effects in those unlikely to benefit.
To correlate changes on fluoro-[18F]-deoxy-2-D-glucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) scans with primary tumor pathologic response and immunologic biomarkers in patients with OCSCC receiving neoadjuvant immunotherapy.
This was a retrospective analysis of serial FDG-PET/CT scans obtained prospectively as part of a phase 2 open-label randomized clinical trial investigating neoadjuvant immunotherapy in patients with untreated OCSCC between 2016 and 2019. Included were a total of 29 patients from a single academic medical center with untreated OCSCC (≥T2, or clinically node positive) randomized 1:1 to receive neoadjuvant therapy with single agent nivolumab or combination nivolumab and ipilimumab followed by surgery and standard of care adjuvant therapy.
The interventions in this study were FDG-PET/CT scans before (T0) and after (T1) preoperative immunotherapy.
Data collected from FDG-PET/CT scans included maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of primary OCSCC and cervical lymph nodes (LNs) at T0 and T1 and new LN uptake and uptake consistent with radiologic immune-related adverse events (irAEs) at T1. Primary OCSCC pathologic response reported as percentages of viable vs nonviable tumor. The number of CD8+ cells/mm2 was determined in the primary tumor biopsy specimen and at surgery.
There was no correlation between pathologic response and change in SUVmax in the primary OCSCC between T0 and T1. Out of 27 total participants, 13 had newly FDG-avid ipsilateral LNs at T1, most negative on pathology. A total of 9 had radiologic irAEs, most commonly sarcoid-like LN (7 of 27). No correlations were found between primary OCSCC SUVmax at T0 and CD8+ T-cell number in the primary tumor biopsy, and no correlations were found between primary OCSCC SUVmax at T1 and CD8+ T-cell number in the primary tumor at surgery.
There were no correlations between changes in FDG uptake after neoadjuvant immunotherapy and pathologic primary tumor response. Importantly, newly FDG-avid ipsilateral LNs following neoadjuvant immunotherapy were commonly observed but did not represent progressive disease or indicate pathologically disease positive nodes in most cases. These findings argue against altering surgical plans in this setting and suggest that the role of FDG-PET/CT may be limited as an early imaging biomarker for predicting pathologic response to preoperative immunotherapy for OCSCC.

"Several de-escalation strategies for human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) have focused on deintensifying gross disease treatment. Reduction of radiotherapy dose and target volume to subclinical regions may achieve good clinical outcomes with favorable patient quality of life (QOL).
To determine outcomes from a systematic approach of reducing radiotherapy dose and target volume to the elective treatment regions in patients with HPV-associated OPC undergoing concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT).
This retrospective cohort study included 276 consecutive patients with HPV-positive OPC receiving CCRT from March 1, 2017, to July 31, 2019. Data were analyzed from February 23 to September 13, 2021.
Elective nodal and subclinical regions received 30 Gy of radiotherapy in 15 fractions, followed by a cone down of 40 Gy in 20 fractions to gross disease for a total dose of 70 Gy. The high retropharyngeal nodal basins in the node-negative neck and bilateral levels IB and V basins were omitted.
Patients were followed up to evaluate locoregional control as the primary outcome and distant metastasis-free survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival as secondary outcomes. Quality-of-life data were obtained at each visit when feasible.
Among the 276 patients included in the analysis, the median age was 61 (range, 36-87) years; 247 (89.5%) were men; and 183 (66.3%) had less than 10 pack-years of smoking history. Most patients (251 [90.9%]) were White. Overall, 87 (31.5%) had cT3-cT4 disease and 65 (23.5%) had cN2-cN3 disease per the 8th edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual. One hundred seventy-two patients (62.3%) completed 300-mg/m2 high-dose cisplatin therapy. During a median follow-up of 26 (range, 21-32) months, 8 patients developed locoregional recurrence, including 7 at the primary site or gross nodes that received a total dose of 70 Gy and 1 with a persistent node not previously identified as gross disease that received a total dose of only 30 Gy. The 24-month locoregional control was 97.0%; progression-free survival, 88.0%; distant metastasis-free survival, 95.2%; and overall survival, 95.1%. During treatment, 17 patients (6.2%) required a feeding tube. At 24 months, most of the QOL composite scores (jaw-related problems, pain, social contact, eating, speech, and swallow) were comparable or superior to baseline measures except for senses, dry mouth, muscular tension, and cognitive functioning, which improved over time but remained marginally worse than baseline.
This cohort study found that the evaluated de-escalation strategy for elective regions showed favorable clinical outcomes and QOL profiles. Long-term follow-up data will help affirm the efficacy of this strategy as a care option for treating HPV-associated OPC with primary CCRT.","['subclinical regions may achieve good clinical outcomes', 'retrospective cohort study included 276 consecutive patients', 'elective regions showed favorable clinical outcomes', 'associated opc undergoing concurrent chemoradiotherapy', '8 patients developed locoregional recurrence', 'hpv )- associated oropharyngeal carcinoma', 'subclinical regions received 30 gy', 'positive opc receiving ccrt', '3 %) completed 300', 'high retropharyngeal nodal basins', 'cohort study found', '276 patients included', '0 %; distant metastasis', 'deintensifying gross disease treatment', 'elective treatment regions', 'month locoregional control', 'evaluate locoregional control', 'favorable patient quality', 'remained marginally worse', 'one hundred seventy', 'cancer staging manual', 'bilateral levels ib', 'american joint committee', 'cn3 disease per', '0 %; progression', 'qol composite scores', 'dose cisplatin therapy', 'baseline measures except', '2 %) required', 'reducing radiotherapy dose', 'associated opc', 'elective nodal', 'secondary outcomes', 'determine outcomes', '30 gy', 'distant metastasis', '3 %)', '2 %;', 'gross disease', 'gross disease', 'v basins', 'm2 high', 'two patients', '17 patients', 'primary ccrt', 'ccrt ).', 'ct4 disease', '70 gy', '70 gy', '40 gy', 'gross nodes', '5 %)', '5 %)', '5 %)', 'total dose', 'total dose', 'total dose', 'radiotherapy dose', 'qol profiles', 'qol ).', 'treating hpv', 'term follow', 'target volume', 'target volume', 'systematic approach', 'social contact', 'smoking history', 'several de', 'september 13', 'related problems', 'primary site', 'primary outcome', 'previously identified', 'negative neck', 'muscular tension', 'median follow', 'median age', 'including 7', 'human papillomavirus', 'help affirm', 'free survival', 'free survival', 'free survival', 'free survival', 'feeding tube', 'evaluated de', 'escalation strategies', 'dry mouth', 'cognitive functioning', 'care option', '9 %])', '8th edition', '20 fractions', '15 fractions', '10 pack', 'overall survival', 'overall survival', 'march 1', '1 %.', 'persistent node', 'july 31', 'february 23', 'escalation strategy', 'opc', '24 months', 'life data', 'patients', 'patients', 'patients', 'treatment', 'received', 'received', 'hpv', 'hpv', 'radiotherapy', 'quality', 'progression', 'baseline', 'overall', '1', 'strategy', 'node', 'months', 'life', '31', '24', '23', 'data', 'data', 'years', 'years', 'white', 'visit', 'time', 'swallow', 'superior', 'speech', 'senses', 'reduction', 'range', 'range', 'pain', 'omitted', 'obtained', 'mg', 'men', 'long', 'less', 'jaw', 'improved', 'followed', 'followed', 'focused', 'feasible', 'efficacy', 'eating', 'ct3', 'cone', 'comparable', 'cn2', 'analyzed', 'analysis', 'among', '97', '95', '95', '90', '89', '88', '87', '87', '66', '65', '62', '61', '6', '36', '32', '26', '251', '247', '21', '2021', '2019', '2017', '183']"
"Multidisciplinary perioperative assessment for patients undergoing complex oncologic head and neck cancer (HNC) surgery is widely implemented. However, to our knowledge, the association of multiprofessional preoperative assessment, information, and briefing with postoperative outcomes has not been evaluated.
To compare postoperative complications, length of hospital stay (LOS), readmissions, mortality, and costs per case among patients undergoing complex oncologic HNC surgery before and after the implementation of a comprehensive preoperative multiprofessional assessment and information day (MUPAID).
This retrospective, single-center case-control study was conducted at a tertiary referral head and neck anticancer center/university cancer institute and compared patients with HNC who were undergoing complex oncological surgeries between January 2012 and July 2018 before (control group) and after (intervention group) implementation of the institutional MUPAID. Data analysis was conducted between 2019 and 2020. The intervention group comprised patients who participated in the MUPAID beginning in February 2015. These patients were assessed by a multiprofessional team and provided with structured and comprehensive information on the surgical procedure and its functional, social, financial, and psychological effects, as well as the postoperative care, rehabilitation, and follow-up period. Patients in the control group had also undergone complex oncologic HNC surgery and were selected through surgical procedure codes.
The end points were postoperative rate and severity of complications, LOS, readmissions, mortality, and costs per case.
The study included 161 patients, 81 in the intervention (25 women [30.9%]) and 80 in the control group (18 women [22.5%]). The groups showed no relevant differences in sociodemographic, disease, and procedural characteristics. The intervention cohort presented with fewer major local and systemic complications (Clavien-Dindo score, III-V: 34.6% vs 52.5%; difference proportion, -0.179; 95% CI, -0.33 to -0.03), shorter median LOS (12 days [IQR, 10-16 days] vs 16 days [IQR, 11-20] days; effect size, 0.482; 95% CI Cohen d, 0.152-0.812) and decreased median charge per case ($50 848 [IQR, $42 510-$63 479] vs $69 602 [IQR, $45 631-$96 280]; effect size, 0.534; 95% CI Cohen d, 0.22-0.85).
The results of this case-control study suggest that MUPAID for patients who are undergoing complex oncologic HNC surgery is associated with shortened LOS and costs per case as well as decreased complications severity. These results are promising on a patient level in the potential to minimize individual treatment burden, as well as on an institutional and health care system level in the potential significant optimization of surgical outcomes and financial aspects.","['costs per case among patients undergoing complex oncologic hnc surgery', '45 631 -$ 96 280 ]; effect size', 'decreased median charge per case ($ 50 848', 'also undergone complex oncologic hnc surgery', 'undergoing complex oncologic hnc surgery', '42 510 -$ 63 479', 'patients undergoing complex oncologic head', '03 ), shorter median los', 'undergoing complex oncological surgeries', 'minimize individual treatment burden', 'costs per case', 'costs per case', '5 %; difference proportion', 'study included 161 patients', 'health care system level', 'comprehensive preoperative multiprofessional assessment', 'intervention group comprised patients', 'tertiary referral head', 'effect size', 'multiprofessional preoperative assessment', 'decreased complications severity', 'multidisciplinary perioperative assessment', 'fewer major local', 'los ), readmissions', 'university cancer institute', 'intervention cohort presented', 'control study suggest', 'potential significant optimization', 'neck anticancer center', 'surgical procedure codes', 'compare postoperative complications', 'center case', 'vs 16 days', 'surgery', 'compared patients', 'postoperative care', 'control study', 'patient level', 'neck cancer', 'multiprofessional team', '5 %]).', 'intervention group', 'surgical procedure', 'shortened los', 'comprehensive information', 'hnc', 'hnc', 'control group', 'control group', 'control group', 'case', '16 days', 'surgical outcomes', 'systemic complications', 'postoperative rate', 'postoperative outcomes', 'widely implemented', 'vs 52', 'relevant differences', 'psychological effects', 'procedural characteristics', 'july 2018', 'january 2012', 'hospital stay', 'groups showed', 'february 2015', 'end points', 'dindo score', 'data analysis', '9 %])', '85 ).', '69 602', '25 women', '18 women', '12 days', 'mupaid beginning', 'mupaid ).', 'information day', 'ci cohen', 'ci cohen', 'patients', 'patients', 'patients', 'financial aspects', 'institutional mupaid', 'los', 'intervention', 'complications', 'vs', 'severity', 'readmissions', 'potential', 'days', 'mupaid', 'information', 'ci', 'institutional', 'financial', 'well', 'well', 'well', 'v', 'structured', 'sociodemographic', 'social', 'single', 'selected', 'retrospective', 'results', 'results', 'rehabilitation', 'provided', 'promising', 'period', 'participated', 'mortality', 'mortality', 'length', 'knowledge', 'iqr', 'iqr', 'iqr', 'iqr', 'implementation', 'implementation', 'iii', 'however', 'functional', 'follow', 'evaluated', 'disease', 'conducted', 'conducted', 'clavien', 'briefing', 'association', 'associated', 'assessed', '95', '95', '95', '812', '81', '80', '6', '534', '482', '34', '33', '30', '22', '22', '2020', '2019', '20', '179', '152', '11', '10', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']"
"Existing criteria to estimate the benefit of a therapy in patients with cancer rely almost exclusively on tumor size, an approach that was not designed to estimate survival benefit and is challenged by the unique properties of immunotherapy. More accurate prediction of survival by treatment could enhance treatment decisions.
To validate, using radiomics and machine learning, the performance of a signature of quantitative computed tomography (CT) imaging features for estimating overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced melanoma treated with immunotherapy.
This prognostic study used radiomics and machine learning to retrospectively analyze CT images obtained at baseline and first follow-up and their associated clinical metadata. Data were prospectively collected in the KEYNOTE-002 (Study of Pembrolizumab [MK-3475] Versus Chemotherapy in Participants With Advanced Melanoma; 2017 analysis) and KEYNOTE-006 (Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Two Different Dosing Schedules of Pembrolizumab [MK-3475] Compared to Ipilimumab in Participants With Advanced Melanoma; 2016 analysis) multicenter clinical trials. Participants included 575 patients with a diagnosis of advanced melanoma who were randomly assigned to training and validation sets. Data for the present study were collected from November 20, 2012, to June 3, 2019, and analyzed from July 1, 2019, to September 15, 2021.
KEYNOTE-002 featured trial groups testing intravenous pembrolizumab, 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg every 2 or every 3 weeks based on randomization, or investigator-choice chemotherapy; KEYNOTE-006 featured trial groups testing intravenous ipilimumab, 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks and intravenous pembrolizumab, 10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks based on randomization.
The performance of the signature CT imaging features for estimating OS at the month 6 posttreatment landmark in patients who received pembrolizumab was measured using an area under the time-dependent receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC).
A random forest model combined 25 imaging features extracted from tumors segmented on CT images to identify the combination (signature) that best estimated OS with pembrolizumab in 575 patients. The signature combined 4 imaging features, 2 related to tumor size and 2 reflecting changes in tumor imaging phenotype. In the validation set (287 patients treated with pembrolizumab), the signature reached an AUC for estimation of OS status of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.89-0.95). The standard method, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1, achieved an AUC of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.75-0.84) and classified tumor outcomes as partial or complete response (93 of 287 [32.4%]), stable disease (90 of 287 [31.3%]), or progressive disease (104 of 287 [36.2%]).
The findings of this prognostic study suggest that the radiomic signature discerned from conventional CT images at baseline and on first follow-up may be used in clinical settings to provide an accurate early readout of future OS probability in patients with melanoma treated with single-agent programmed cell death 1 blockade.","['random forest model combined 25 imaging features extracted', '006 featured trial groups testing intravenous ipilimumab', '002 featured trial groups testing intravenous pembrolizumab', 'agent programmed cell death 1 blockade', 'treatment could enhance treatment decisions', 'dependent receiver operating characteristics curve', 'signature combined 4 imaging features', 'retrospectively analyze ct images obtained', 'two different dosing schedules', 'month 6 posttreatment landmark', 'cancer rely almost exclusively', 'signature ct imaging features', '4 %]), stable disease', 'every 3 weeks based', 'kg every 3 weeks', 'prognostic study used radiomics', 'participants included 575 patients', '3 weeks based', 'tumor imaging phenotype', 'conventional ct images', 'imaging features', 'quantitative computed tomography', 'kg every 2', 'kg every 2', 'prognostic study suggest', 'radiomic signature discerned', 'multicenter clinical trials', 'associated clinical metadata', 'solid tumors 1', 'classified tumor outcomes', 'accurate early readout', '2 reflecting changes', 'future os probability', 'best estimated os', 'response evaluation criteria', 'estimating overall survival', 'intravenous pembrolizumab', 'advanced melanoma treated', 'estimate survival benefit', 'ct images', '287 patients treated', '3 %]),', 'using radiomics', 'progressive disease', 'july 1', 'melanoma treated', '575 patients', 'june 3', '3 mg', 'estimating os', 'signature reached', 'clinical settings', 'tumors segmented', 'tumor size', 'tumor size', 'existing criteria', 'complete response', 'accurate prediction', '2 related', '2 mg', '2 %]).', 'advanced melanoma', 'advanced melanoma', 'advanced melanoma', 'received pembrolizumab', 'pembrolizumab ),', 'present study', 'os status', 'versus chemotherapy', 'validation sets', 'validation set', 'unique properties', 'standard method', 'september 15', 'randomly assigned', 'november 20', 'measured using', 'machine learning', 'machine learning', 'ipilimumab', 'first follow', 'first follow', 'choice chemotherapy', '2017 analysis', '2016 analysis', '10 mg', '10 mg', '006', '002', 'prospectively collected', 'auc ).', '95 ).', 'ct', '1', 'kg', 'signature', 'signature', 'used', 'survival', 'pembrolizumab', 'pembrolizumab', 'pembrolizumab', 'study', 'study', 'os', 'participants', 'participants', 'estimate', 'benefit', 'patients', 'patients', 'patients', 'patients', 'collected', '287', '287', '287', 'auc', 'auc', '95', '95', 'validate', 'training', 'time', 'therapy', 'single', 'safety', 'randomization', 'randomization', 'provide', 'performance', 'performance', 'partial', 'mk', 'mk', 'may', 'keynote', 'keynote', 'keynote', 'keynote', 'investigator', 'immunotherapy', 'immunotherapy', 'identify', 'findings', 'evaluate', 'estimation', 'efficacy', 'diagnosis', 'designed', 'data', 'data', 'compared', 'combination', 'ci', 'ci', 'challenged', 'baseline', 'baseline', 'area', 'approach', 'analyzed', 'achieved', '93', '92', '90', '89', '84', '80', '75', '36', '3475', '3475', '32', '31', '2021', '2019', '2019', '2012', '104', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']"
"Extramammary Paget disease (EMPD) is a frequently recurring malignant neoplasm with metastatic potential that presents in older adults on the genital, perianal, and axillary skin. Extramammary Paget disease can precede or occur along with internal malignant neoplasms.
To develop recommendations for the care of adults with EMPD.
A systematic review of the literature on EMPD from January 1990 to September 18, 2019, was conducted using MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, and Cochrane Libraries. Analysis included 483 studies. A multidisciplinary expert panel evaluation of the findings led to the development of clinical care recommendations for EMPD.
The key findings were as follows: (1) Multiple skin biopsies, including those of any nodular areas, are critical for diagnosis. (2) Malignant neoplasm screening appropriate for age and anatomical site should be performed at baseline to distinguish between primary and secondary EMPD. (3) Routine use of sentinel lymph node biopsy or lymph node dissection is not recommended. (4) For intraepidermal EMPD, surgical and nonsurgical treatments may be used depending on patient and tumor characteristics, although cure rates may be superior with surgical approaches. For invasive EMPD, surgical resection with curative intent is preferred. (5) Patients with unresectable intraepidermal EMPD or patients who are medically unable to undergo surgery may receive nonsurgical treatments, including radiotherapy, imiquimod, photodynamic therapy, carbon dioxide laser therapy, or other modalities. (6) Distant metastatic disease may be treated with chemotherapy or individualized targeted approaches. (7) Close follow-up to monitor for recurrence is recommended for at least the first 5 years.
Clinical practice guidelines for EMPD provide guidance regarding recommended diagnostic approaches, differentiation between invasive and noninvasive disease, and use of surgical vs nonsurgical treatments. Prospective registries may further improve our understanding of the natural history of the disease in primary vs secondary EMPD, clarify features of high-risk tumors, and identify superior management approaches.","['empd provide guidance regarding recommended diagnostic approaches', 'undergo surgery may receive nonsurgical treatments', 'multidisciplinary expert panel evaluation', 'analysis included 483 studies', 'although cure rates may', 'malignant neoplasm screening appropriate', 'frequently recurring malignant neoplasm', 'sentinel lymph node biopsy', 'carbon dioxide laser therapy', 'surgical vs nonsurgical treatments', 'identify superior management approaches', 'distant metastatic disease may', 'nonsurgical treatments may', 'primary vs secondary empd', 'prospective registries may', 'lymph node dissection', 'individualized targeted approaches', 'internal malignant neoplasms', 'science core collection', 'conducted using medline', 'clinical practice guidelines', 'extramammary paget disease', 'extramammary paget disease', 'multiple skin biopsies', 'first 5 years', 'unresectable intraepidermal empd', 'clinical care recommendations', 'surgical approaches', 'secondary empd', 'photodynamic therapy', 'metastatic potential', 'intraepidermal empd', 'noninvasive disease', 'develop recommendations', 'axillary skin', 'surgical resection', 'used depending', 'tumor characteristics', 'systematic review', 'september 18', 'risk tumors', 'occur along', 'nodular areas', 'natural history', 'medically unable', 'key findings', 'january 1990', 'findings led', 'curative intent', 'cochrane libraries', 'close follow', 'clarify features', 'anatomical site', 'invasive empd', 'routine use', 'older adults', 'including radiotherapy', 'recommended', 'recommended', 'disease', 'superior', 'primary', 'empd', 'empd', 'empd', 'empd', 'surgical', 'care', '5', 'use', 'invasive', 'including', 'adults', 'web', 'understanding', 'treated', 'recurrence', 'presents', 'preferred', 'precede', 'perianal', 'performed', 'patients', 'patients', 'patient', 'monitor', 'modalities', 'literature', 'least', 'improve', 'imiquimod', 'high', 'genital', 'follows', 'embase', 'distinguish', 'differentiation', 'diagnosis', 'development', 'critical', 'chemotherapy', 'baseline', 'age', '7', '6', '4', '3', '2019', '2', '1']"
"Radiotherapy combined with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is a standard of care for high-risk prostate cancer. However, the interplay between radiotherapy dose and the required minimum duration of ADT is uncertain.
To determine the specific ADT duration threshold that provides a distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) benefit in patients with high-risk prostate cancer receiving external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) or EBRT with a brachytherapy boost (EBRT+BT).
This was a cohort study of 3 cohorts assembled from a multicenter retrospective study (2000-2013); a post hoc analysis of the Randomized Androgen Deprivation and Radiotherapy 03/04 (RADAR; 2003-2007) randomized clinical trial (RCT); and a cross-trial comparison of the RADAR vs the Deprivación Androgénica y Radio Terapía (Androgen Deprivation and Radiation Therapy; DART) 01/05 RCT (2005-2010). In all, the study analyzed 1827 patients treated with EBRT and 1108 patients treated with EBRT+BT from the retrospective cohort; 181 treated with EBRT and 203 with EBRT+BT from RADAR; and 91 patients treated with EBRT from DART. The study was conducted from October 15, 2020, to July 1, 2021, and the data analyses, from January 5 to June 15, 2021.
High-dose EBRT or EBRT+BT for an ADT duration determined by patient-physician choice (retrospective) or by randomization (RCTs).
The primary outcome was DMFS; secondary outcome was overall survival (OS). Natural cubic spline analysis identified minimum thresholds (months).
This cohort study of 3 studies totaling 3410 men (mean age [SD], 68 [62-74] years; race and ethnicity not collected) with high-risk prostate cancer found a significant interaction between the treatment type (EBRT vs EBRT+BT) and ADT duration (binned to <6, 6 to <18, and ≥18 months). Natural cubic spline analysis identified minimum duration thresholds of 26.3 months (95% CI, 25.4-36.0 months) for EBRT and 12 months (95% CI, 4.9-36.0 months) for EBRT+BT for optimal effect on DMFS. In RADAR, the prolongation of ADT for patients receiving only EBRT was not associated with significant improvements in DMFS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 95% CI, 0.65-1.57); however, for patients receiving EBRT+BT, a longer duration was associated with improved DMFS (DMFS HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.36-0.87; P = .01). For patients receiving EBRT alone (DART), 28 months of ADT was associated with improved DMFS compared with 18 months (RADAR HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.17-0.80; P = .01).
These cohort study findings suggest that the optimal minimum ADT duration for treatment with high-dose EBRT alone is more than 18 months; and for EBRT+BT, it is 18 months or possibly less. Additional studies are needed to determine more precise minimum durations.","['natural cubic spline analysis identified minimum duration thresholds', 'natural cubic spline analysis identified minimum thresholds', 'risk prostate cancer receiving external beam radiotherapy', '3 studies totaling 3410 men', 'study analyzed 1827 patients treated', 'risk prostate cancer found', 'risk prostate cancer', 'specific adt duration threshold', 'optimal minimum adt duration', 'cohort study findings suggest', 'dart ), 28 months', 'patients receiving ebrt alone', 'post hoc analysis', 'required minimum duration', 'precise minimum durations', '≥ 18 months ).', '3 cohorts assembled', '91 patients treated', '1108 patients treated', 'sd ], 68', 'adt duration determined', 'patients receiving ebrt', 'randomized clinical trial', 'randomized androgen deprivation', 'multicenter retrospective study', 'androgen deprivation therapy', 'dose ebrt alone', 'hr ], 1', '57 ); however', 'improved dmfs compared', 'patients receiving', 'adt duration', 'ebrt vs ebrt', '3 months', 'longer duration', 'radiotherapy dose', 'additional studies', 'cohort study', 'cohort study', 'androgen deprivation', 'radiotherapy combined', 'radiotherapy 03', '181 treated', 'optimal effect', 'months ).', '18 months', '18 months', '18 months', 'trial comparison', 'retrospective cohort', 'radiation therapy', '12 months', 'rct );', '2013 );', 'rcts ).', 'os ).', '2010 ).', 'improved dmfs', 'significant interaction', 'significant improvements', 'secondary outcome', 'radio terapía', 'primary outcome', 'possibly less', 'physician choice', 'overall survival', 'october 15', 'mean age', 'june 15', 'july 1', 'january 5', 'hazard ratio', 'free survival', 'distant metastasis', 'deprivación androgénica', 'data analyses', 'brachytherapy boost', '05 rct', 'dose ebrt', 'dmfs hr', 'radar vs', '01 ).', '01 ).', 'radar hr', '0 months', '0 months', 'treatment type', 'bt ).', 'patients', 'study', '18', 'adt', 'adt', 'adt', 'adt', 'retrospective', 'however', 'dart', 'dart', '1', 'ebrt', 'ebrt', 'ebrt', 'ebrt', 'ebrt', 'ebrt', 'ebrt', 'ebrt', 'ebrt', 'ebrt', 'ebrt', 'ebrt', 'ebrt', 'dmfs', 'dmfs', 'dmfs', 'dmfs', 'treatment', '01', '01', 'radar', 'radar', 'radar', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', 'bt', 'bt', 'bt', 'bt', 'bt', 'bt', 'bt', 'years', 'uncertain', 'standard', 'randomization', 'race', 'provides', 'prolongation', 'patient', 'p', 'p', 'needed', 'interplay', 'high', 'high', 'high', 'high', 'high', 'ethnicity', 'determine', 'determine', 'cross', 'conducted', 'collected', 'ci', 'ci', 'ci', 'ci', 'ci', 'care', 'binned', 'benefit', 'associated', 'associated', 'associated', '95', '95', '95', '95', '95', '9', '87', '80', '74', '65', '62', '6', '6', '56', '4', '4', '37', '36', '36', '36', '26', '25', '203', '2021', '2021', '2020', '2007', '2005', '2003', '2000', '17', '04']"

VEGFR2 is the dominant receptor that is required for the growth and survival of the endothelium, whereas deletion of VEGFR1 or VEGFR3 was reported to induce vasculature overgrowth. Here we show that vascular regression induced by VEGFR2 deletion in postnatal and adult mice is aggravated by additional deletion of VEGFR1 or VEGFR3 in the intestine, kidney, and pancreas, but not in the liver or kidney glomeruli. In the adult mice, hepatic and intestinal vessels regressed within a few days after gene deletion, whereas vessels in skin and retina remained stable for at least four weeks. Our results show changes in endothelial transcriptomes and organ-specific vessel maintenance mechanisms that are dependent on VEGFR signaling pathways and reveal previously unknown functions of VEGFR1 and VEGFR3 in endothelial cells.","['reveal previously unknown functions', 'intestinal vessels regressed within', 'specific vessel maintenance mechanisms', 'vascular endothelial growth factors', 'vascular regression induced', 'vegfr signaling pathways', 'retina remained stable', 'least four weeks', 'induce vasculature overgrowth', 'results show changes', 'whereas vessels', 'lymphatic vessels', 'endothelial transcriptomes', 'endothelial cells', 'whereas deletion', 'poorly understood', 'genetic interactions', 'gene deletion', 'dominant receptor', 'adult mice', 'adult mice', 'additional deletion', 'vegfr2 deletion', 'kidney glomeruli', 'maintenance', 'growth', 'show', 'vegfr2', 'kidney', 'vegfs', 'vegfrs', 'vegfrs', 'vegfr3', 'vegfr3', 'vegfr3', 'vegfr1', 'vegfr1', 'vegfr1', 'survival', 'skin', 'required', 'reported', 'receptors', 'quintessential', 'postnatal', 'pancreas', 'organ', 'liver', 'intestine', 'however', 'hepatic', 'endothelium', 'development', 'dependent', 'days', 'blood', 'aggravated']"

"Bioorthogonal chemistry is a powerful tool to site-specifically activate drugs in living systems. Bioorthogonal reactions between a pair of biologically reactive groups can rapidly and specifically take place in a mild physiological milieu without perturbing inherent biochemical processes. Attributed to their high selectivity and efficiency, bioorthogonal reactions can significantly decrease background signals in bioimaging. Compared with metal-catalyzed bioorthogonal click reactions, metal-free click reactions are more biocompatible without the metal catalyst-induced cytotoxicity. Although a great number of bioorthogonal chemistry-based strategies have been reported for cancer theranostics, a comprehensive review is scarce to highlight the advantages of these strategies. In this review, recent progress in cancer theranostics guided by metal-free bioorthogonal click chemistry will be depicted in detail. The elaborate design as well as the advantages of bioorthogonal chemistry in tumor theranostics are summarized and future prospects in this emerging field are emphasized.","['mild physiological milieu without perturbing inherent biochemical processes', 'significantly decrease background signals', 'catalyzed bioorthogonal click reactions', 'free bioorthogonal click chemistry', 'free click reactions', 'specifically take place', 'specifically activate drugs', 'biologically reactive groups', 'cancer theranostics guided', 'biocompatible without', 'bioorthogonal reactions', 'bioorthogonal reactions', 'bioorthogonal chemistry', 'bioorthogonal chemistry', 'bioorthogonal chemistry', 'cancer theranostics', 'tumor theranostics', 'recent progress', 'powerful tool', 'living systems', 'induced cytotoxicity', 'high selectivity', 'great number', 'future prospects', 'emerging field', 'elaborate design', 'comprehensive review', 'based strategies', 'metal catalyst', 'strategies', 'review', 'metal', 'metal', 'metal', 'well', 'summarized', 'site', 'scarce', 'reported', 'rapidly', 'pair', 'highlight', 'emphasized', 'efficiency', 'detail', 'depicted', 'compared', 'bioimaging', 'attributed', 'although', 'advantages', 'advantages']"
"This study aims to compare the metabolomic profiles of Malaysian and New Zealand honey while determining their anti-oncogenic activity for potential prophylactic functions. Metabolomics tools including multivariate analysis were applied on concatenated LC-HRMS and NMR datasets to afford an intensive chemical profile of honey samples and have a snapshot of the bioactive metabolites in the respective collections. Malaysian samples were found to have higher sugar and polyphenolic content, while New Zealand samples afforded higher concentration of low molecular weight (MW) lipids. However, New Zealand honey collected from the northern islands had higher concentration of acetylated saccharides, while those from the southern islands yielded higher low MW phenolic metabolites that were comparable to Malaysian honey.

"The different molecular profiles of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) between ventricular and lumbar compartments remain elusive, especially in the context of leptomeningeal metastasis (LM), which affects CSF flow. We evaluated CSF metabolomic and proteomic profiles based on the compartments and the diagnosis of spinal LM, proved by MRI from 20 paired ventricular and lumbar CSF samples of LM patients, including 12 spinal LM (+) samples. In metabolome analysis, 9512 low-mass ions (LMIs) were identified-7 LMIs were abundant in all lumbar versus paired ventricular CSF samples, and 3 LMIs were significantly abundant in all ventricular CSF. In comparisons between spinal LM (+) CSF and LM (-) CSF, 105 LMIs were discriminative for spinal LM (+) CSF. In proteome analysis, a total of 1536 proteins were measured. A total of 18 proteins, including complement C3, were more highly expressed in all lumbar CSF, compared with paired ventricular CSF, while 82 proteins, including coagulation factor V, were higher in the ventricular CSF. Of 37 discriminative proteins, including uteroglobin and complement component C8 gamma chain, 4 were higher in all spinal LM (+) CSF versus spinal LM (-) CSF. We further evaluated metabolic pathways associated with these discriminative proteins using the Gene Ontology database. We found that 16/17 spinal LM (+) pathways, including complement activation, were associated with lumbar discriminative proteins, whereas only 2 pathways were associated with ventricular-discriminative proteins. In conclusion, we determined that metabolite and protein profiles differed between paired lumbar and ventricular CSF samples. The protein profiles of spinal LM (+) CSF showed more similarity with the lumbar CSF than the ventricular CSF. Thus, we suggest that CSF LMIs and proteins could reflect LM disease activity and that LM-associated differences in CSF are more likely to be present in the lumbar compartment.","['spinal lm (+) csf versus spinal lm (-) csf', 'proteins could reflect lm disease activity', 'including 12 spinal lm (+) samples', 'lumbar versus paired ventricular csf samples', '17 spinal lm (+) pathways', 'spinal lm (+) csf showed', 'complement component c8 gamma chain', 'spinal lm (+) csf', 'spinal lm (+) csf', 'including coagulation factor v', 'lm (-) csf', 'lumbar compartments remain elusive', 'evaluated metabolic pathways associated', 'lumbar csf samples', 'ventricular csf samples', 'including complement c3', 'including complement activation', 'spinal lm', 'evaluated csf metabolomic', 'paired ventricular csf', 'affects csf flow', '20 paired ventricular', 'gene ontology database', 'proteomic profiles based', 'different molecular profiles', 'lumbar discriminative proteins', 'discriminative proteins using', '37 discriminative proteins', 'protein profiles differed', 'paired lumbar', 'lm patients', 'lm ),', 'lumbar csf', 'lumbar csf', 'ventricular csf', 'ventricular csf', 'ventricular csf', '2 pathways', 'including uteroglobin', 'discriminative proteins', 'protein profiles', 'csf lmis', 'lumbar compartment', '82 proteins', '18 proteins', '1536 proteins', 'lm', 'proteome analysis', 'metabolome analysis', 'mass ions', 'leptomeningeal metastasis', 'highly expressed', 'cerebrospinal fluid', 'associated differences', '9512 low', '7 lmis', '3 lmis', '105 lmis', 'significantly abundant', 'csf', 'csf', 'ventricular', 'ventricular', 'compartments', 'discriminative', 'associated', 'associated', 'lmis', 'abundant', 'whereas', 'total', 'total', 'thus', 'suggest', 'similarity', 'proved', 'present', 'mri', 'metabolite', 'measured', 'likely', 'identified', 'higher', 'higher', 'found', 'especially', 'diagnosis', 'determined', 'context', 'conclusion', 'comparisons', 'compared', '4', '16']"
"The term 'aerobic glycolysis' has been in use ever since Warburg conducted his research on cancer cells' proliferation and discovered that cells use glycolysis to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) rather than the more efficient oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos) pathway, despite an abundance of oxygen. When measurements of glucose and oxygen utilization by activated neural tissue indicated that glucose was consumed without an accompanied oxygen consumption, the investigators who performed those measurements also termed their discovery 'aerobic glycolysis'. Red blood cells do not contain mitochondria and, therefore, produce their energy needs via glycolysis alone. Other processes within the central nervous system (CNS) and additional organs and tissues (heart, muscle, and so on), such as ion pumps, are also known to utilize glycolysis only for the production of ATP necessary to support their function. Unfortunately, the phenomenon of 'aerobic glycolysis' is an enigma wherever it is encountered, thus several hypotheses have been produced in attempts to explain it; that is, whether it occurs in cancer cells, in activated neural tissue, or during postprandial or exercise metabolism. Here, it is argued that, where the phenomenon in neural tissue is concerned, the prefix 'aerobic' in the term 'aerobic glycolysis' should be removed. Data collected over the past three decades indicate that L-lactate, the end product of the glycolytic pathway, plays an essential role in brain energy metabolism, justifying the elimination of the prefix 'aerobic'. Similar justification is probably appropriate for other tissues as well.","['use ever since warburg conducted', 'energy needs via glycolysis alone', 'past three decades indicate', 'activated neural tissue indicated', 'brain energy metabolism', 'activated neural tissue', 'cells use glycolysis', 'thus several hypotheses', 'efficient oxidative phosphorylation', 'central nervous system', 'red blood cells', 'produce adenosine triphosphate', 'accompanied oxygen consumption', 'measurements also termed', ""aerobic glycolysis '."", 'neural tissue', 'utilize glycolysis', 'aerobic glycolysis', 'aerobic glycolysis', 'aerobic glycolysis', 'exercise metabolism', 'cancer cells', 'cancer cells', 'also known', ""aerobic '."", 'similar justification', 'processes within', 'probably appropriate', 'oxygen utilization', 'ion pumps', 'essential role', 'enigma wherever', 'end product', 'data collected', 'contain mitochondria', 'consumed without', 'additional organs', 'glycolytic pathway', 'atp necessary', 'produce', 'oxygen', 'measurements', 'aerobic', 'pathway', 'atp', 'whether', 'well', 'unfortunately', 'tissues', 'tissues', 'therefore', 'term', 'term', 'support', 'research', 'removed', 'rather', 'proliferation', 'production', 'produced', 'prefix', 'prefix', 'postprandial', 'plays', 'phenomenon', 'phenomenon', 'performed', 'oxphos', 'occurs', 'muscle', 'lactate', 'l', 'justifying', 'investigators', 'heart', 'glucose', 'glucose', 'function', 'explain', 'encountered', 'elimination', 'discovery', 'discovered', 'despite', 'concerned', 'cns', 'attempts', 'argued', 'abundance', '),']"

We analyzed additional samples and confirmed consistency between the newly and previously analyzed data. In total, we included 36 HC, 34 adenoma (AD), and 214 CRC samples, which were used for subsequent analyses. Among the 132 quantified metabolites, 16 exhibited consistent differences in both datasets, which included polyamines, etc. Pathway analyses of the integrated data revealed significant differences in many metabolites, such as glutamine, and metabolites of the TCA (tricarboxylic acid cycle) and urea cycles. The discrimination ability of the combination of multiple metabolites among the three groups was evaluated, which yielded higher sensitivity than tumor markers. The Mann-Whitney test was employed to evaluate the prognosis predictivity of the assessed metabolites and the difference between the patients with or without recurrence, which yielded 16 significantly different metabolites.

"The gut microbiota is a complex and dynamic ecosystem essential for the proper functioning of the organism, affecting the health and disease status of the individuals. There is continuous and bidirectional communication between gut microbiota and the host, conforming to a unique entity known as ""holobiont"". Among these crosstalk mechanisms, the gut microbiota synthesizes a broad spectrum of bioactive compounds or metabolites which exert pleiotropic effects on the human organism. Many of these microbial metabolites can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) or have significant effects on the brain, playing a key role in the so-called microbiota-gut-brain axis. An altered microbiota-gut-brain (MGB) axis is a major characteristic of many neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD). Significative differences between gut eubiosis and dysbiosis in mental disorders like MDD with their different metabolite composition and concentrations are being discussed. In the present review, the main microbial metabolites (short-chain fatty acids -SCFAs-, bile acids, amino acids, tryptophan -trp- derivatives, and more), their signaling pathways and functions will be summarized to explain part of MDD pathophysiology.

"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is characterized by metabolic deregulations that often manifest as deviations in metabolite levels and aberrations in their corresponding metabolic genes across the clinical specimens and preclinical PC models. Cholesterol is one of the critical metabolites supporting PC, synthesized or acquired by PC cells. Nevertheless, the significance of the de novo cholesterol synthesis pathway has been controversial in PC, indicating the need to reassess this pathway in PC. We utilized preclinical models and clinical specimens of PC patients and cell lines and utilized mass spectrometry-based sterol analysis. Further, we also performed in silico analysis to corroborate the significance of de novo cholesterol synthesis pathway in PC. Our results demonstrated alteration in free sterol levels, including free cholesterol, across in vitro, in vivo, and clinical specimens of PC. Especially, our sterol analyses established consistent alterations in free cholesterol across the different PC models.

"The intestinal mucosa is a highly absorptive organ and simultaneously constitutes the physical barrier between the host and a complex outer ecosystem. Intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) represent a special node that receives signals from the host and the environment and translates them into corresponding responses. Specific molecular communication systems such as metabolites are known to transmit information across the intestinal boundary. The gut microbiota or food-derived metabolites are extrinsic factors that influence the homeostasis of the intestinal epithelium, while mitochondrial and host-derived cellular metabolites determine the identity, fitness, and regenerative capacity of IECs. Little is known, however, about the role of intrinsic and extrinsic metabolites of IECs in the initiation and progression of pathological processes such as inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer as well as about their impact on intestinal immunity. In this review, we will highlight the most recent contributions on the modulatory effects of intestinal metabolites in gut pathophysiology, with a particular focus on metabolites in promoting intestinal inflammation or colorectal tumorigenesis. In addition, we will provide a perspective on the role of newly identified oncometabolites from the commensal and opportunistic microbiota in shaping response and resistance to antitumor therapy.","['specific molecular communication systems', 'derived cellular metabolites determine', 'transmit information across', 'newly identified oncometabolites', 'inflammatory bowel disease', 'highly absorptive organ', 'complex outer ecosystem', 'promoting intestinal inflammation', 'intestinal epithelial cells', 'derived metabolites', 'intestinal mucosa', 'intestinal metabolites', 'intestinal immunity', 'intestinal epithelium', 'intestinal boundary', 'special node', 'simultaneously constitutes', 'shaping response', 'regenerative capacity', 'recent contributions', 'receives signals', 'physical barrier', 'pathological processes', 'particular focus', 'opportunistic microbiota', 'modulatory effects', 'gut pathophysiology', 'gut microbiota', 'extrinsic metabolites', 'extrinsic factors', 'corresponding responses', 'colorectal tumorigenesis', 'colorectal cancer', 'antitumor therapy', 'metabolites', 'metabolites', 'well', 'translates', 'role', 'role', 'review', 'resistance', 'represent', 'provide', 'progression', 'perspective', 'mitochondrial', 'little', 'known', 'known', 'intrinsic', 'initiation', 'influence', 'impact', 'iecs', 'iecs', 'iecs', 'identity', 'however', 'host', 'host', 'host', 'homeostasis', 'highlight', 'food', 'fitness', 'environment', 'commensal', 'addition']"
"The urinary volatomic profiling of Indian cohorts composed of 28 lung cancer (LC) patients and 27 healthy subjects (control group, CTRL) was established using headspace solid phase microextraction technique combined with gas chromatography mass spectrometry methodology as a powerful approach to identify urinary volatile organic metabolites (uVOMs) to discriminate among LC patients from CTRL. Overall, 147 VOMs of several chemistries were identified in the intervention groups-including naphthalene derivatives, phenols, and organosulphurs-augmented in the LC group. In contrast, benzene and terpenic derivatives were found to be more prevalent in the CTRL group. The volatomic data obtained were processed using advanced statistical analysis, namely partial least square discriminative analysis (PLS-DA), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) methods. This resulted in the identification of nine uVOMs with a higher potential to discriminate LC patients from CTRL subjects. These were furan, o-cymene, furfural, linalool oxide, viridiflorene, 2-bromo-phenol, tricyclazole, 4-methyl-phenol, and 1-(4-hydroxy-3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl)-2-methyl-3-morpholinopropan-1-one. The metabolic pathway analysis of the data obtained identified several altered biochemical pathways in LC mainly affecting glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pyruvate metabolism, and fatty acid biosynthesis. Moreover, acetate and octanoic, decanoic, and dodecanoic fatty acids were identified as the key metabolites responsible for such deregulation.

"Recent advances in emergency medicine and the co-ordinated delivery of trauma care mean more critically-injured patients now reach the hospital alive and survive life-saving operations. Indeed, between 2008 and 2017, the odds of surviving a major traumatic injury in the UK increased by nineteen percent. However, the improved survival rates of severely-injured patients have placed an increased burden on the healthcare system, with major trauma a common cause of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions that last ≥10 days. Improved understanding of the factors influencing patient outcomes is now urgently needed. We investigated the serum metabolomic profile of fifty-five major trauma patients across three post-injury phases: acute (days 0-4), intermediate (days 5-14) and late (days 15-112). Using ICU length of stay (LOS) as a clinical outcome, we aimed to determine whether the serum metabolome measured at days 0-4 post-injury for patients with an extended (≥10 days) ICU LOS differed from that of patients with a short (<10 days) ICU LOS. In addition, we investigated whether combining metabolomic profiles with clinical scoring systems would generate a variable that would identify patients with an extended ICU LOS with a greater degree of accuracy than models built on either variable alone. The number of metabolites unique to and shared across each time segment varied across acute, intermediate and late segments. A one-way ANOVA revealed the most variation in metabolite levels across the different time-points was for the metabolites lactate, glucose, anserine and 3-hydroxybutyrate. A total of eleven features were selected to differentiate between <10 days ICU LOS vs. >10 days ICU LOS.

"Childhood obesity has increased worldwide, and many clinical and public interventions have attempted to reduce morbidity. We aimed to determine the metabolomic signatures associated with weight control interventions in children with obesity. Forty children from the ""Intervention for Children and Adolescent Obesity via Activity and Nutrition (ICAAN)"" cohort were selected according to intervention responses. Based on changes in body mass index z-scores, 20 were responders and the remaining non-responders. Their serum metabolites were quantitatively analyzed using capillary electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry at baseline and after 6 and 18 months of intervention. After 18 months of intervention, the metabolite cluster changes in the responders and non-responders showed a difference on the heatmap, but significant metabolites were not clear. However, regardless of the responses, 13 and 49 metabolites were significant in the group of children with obesity intervention at 6 months and 18 months post-intervention compared to baseline.

"Intestinal acute rejection (AR) lacks a reliable non-invasive biomarker and AR surveillance is conducted through frequent endoscopic biopsies. Although citrulline and calprotectin have been suggested as AR biomarkers, these have limited clinical value. Using a mouse model of intestinal transplantation (ITx), we performed a proteome-wide analysis and investigated rejection-related proteome changes that may eventually be used as biomarkers. ITx was performed in allogenic (Balb/C to C57Bl) and syngeneic (C57Bl) combinations. Graft samples were obtained three and six days after transplantation (n = 4/time point) and quantitative proteomic analysis with iTRAQ-labeling and mass spectrometry of whole tissue homogenates was performed. Histology showed moderate AR in all allografts post-transplantation at day six. Nine hundred and thirty-eight proteins with at least three unique peptides were identified in the intestinal grafts. Eighty-six proteins varying by >20% between time points and/or groups had an alteration pattern unique to the rejecting allografts: thirty-seven proteins and enzymes (including S100-A8 and IDO-1) were significantly upregulated whereas forty-nine (among other chromogranin, ornithine aminotransferase, and arginase) were downregulated. Numerous proteins showed altered expression during intestinal AR, several of which were previously identified to be involved in acute rejection, although our results also identified previously unreported proteome changes.

"Sleep is a state in which important restorative and anabolic processes occur. Understanding changes of these metabolic processes during the circadian rhythm in the brain is crucial to elucidate neurophysiological mechanisms important for sleep function. Investigation of amino acid modifications and dipeptides has recently emerged as a valuable approach in the metabolic profiling of the central nervous system. Nonetheless, very little is known about the effects of sleep on the brain levels of amino acid analogues. In the present study, we examined brain regional sleep-induced alterations selective for modified amino acids and dipeptides using Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-MS/MS (UHPLC-MS/MS) based metabolomics. Our approach enabled the detection and identification of numerous amino acid-containing metabolites in the cortex, the hippocampus, the midbrain, and the cerebellum.

"Energy metabolism, including alterations in energy intake and expenditure, is closely related to aging and longevity. Metabolomics studies have recently unraveled changes in metabolite composition in plasma and tissues during aging and have provided critical information to elucidate the molecular basis of the aging process. However, the metabolic changes in tissues responsible for food intake and lipid storage have remained unexplored. In this study, we aimed to investigate aging-related metabolic alterations in these tissues. To fill this gap, we employed NMR-based metabolomics in several tissues, including different parts of the intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum) and brown/white adipose tissues (BAT, WAT), of young (9-10 weeks) and old (96-104 weeks) wild-type (mixed genetic background of 129/J and C57BL/6) mice. We, further, included plasma and skeletal muscle of the same mice to verify previous results. Strikingly, we found that duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and WAT do not metabolically age. In contrast, plasma, skeletal muscle, and BAT show a strong metabolic aging phenotype.

However, more than 90% of skin cancer cases could be avoided with appropriate preventive measures such as regular sunscreen use. Plants, constantly irradiated by sunlight, are able to synthesize specialized molecules to fight against UVR damage. Phenolic compounds, alkaloids and carotenoids constitute the major plant secondary metabolism compounds with relevant UVR protection activities. Hence, plants are an important source of molecules used to avoid UVR damage, reduce photoaging and prevent skin cancers and related illnesses. Due to its significance, we reviewed the main plant secondary metabolites related to UVR protection and its reported mechanisms.

"(1) Introduction: Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality among immunocompromised patients with hematologic malignancies (HM) and stem cell transplants (SCT). Isavuconazole was approved by FDA as a primary therapy for Invasive Aspergillosis (IA) and Mucormycosis. The aim of this study is to look at the real-world use of Isavuconazole in patients with HM and evaluate their clinical outcomes and safety. (2) Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of HM patients at MD Anderson Cancer Center who had definite, probable or possible mold infections between 1 April 2016 and 31 January 2020 and were treated with Isavuconazole for a period of at least 7 days. Clinical and radiological findings were assessed at baseline and at 6 and 12 weeks of follow up. (3) Results: We included 200 HM patients with IFIs that were classified as definite (11), probable (63) and possible (126). Aspergillus spp was the most commonly isolated pathogen. The majority of patients (59%) received prophylaxis with anti-mold therapy and Isavuconazole was used as a primary therapy in 43% of patients, and as salvage therapy in 58%. The switch to Isavuconazole was driven by the failure of the primary therapy in 66% of the cases and by adverse effects in 29%. Isavuconazole was used as monotherapy in 30% of the cases and in combination in 70%. Adverse events possibly related to Isavuconazole were reported in eight patients (4%) leading to drug discontinuation.

"Phylum Cnidaria has been an excellent source of natural products, with thousands of metabolites identified. Many of these have not been screened in bioassays. The aim of this study was to explore the potential of 5600 Cnidaria natural products (after excluding those known to derive from microbial symbionts), using a systematic approach based on chemical space, drug-likeness, predicted toxicity, and virtual screens. Previous drug-likeness measures: the rule-of-five, quantitative estimate of drug-likeness (QED), and relative drug likelihoods (RDL) are based on a relatively small number of molecular properties. We augmented this approach using reference drug and toxin data sets defined for 51 predicted molecular properties. Cnidaria natural products overlap with drugs and toxins in this chemical space, although a multivariate test suggests that there are some differences between the groups. In terms of the established drug-likeness measures, Cnidaria natural products have generally lower QED and RDL scores than drugs, with a higher prevalence of metabolites that exceed at least one rule-of-five threshold. An index of drug-likeness that includes predicted toxicity (ADMET-score), however, found that Cnidaria natural products were more favourable than drugs. A measure of the distance of individual Cnidaria natural products to the centre of the drug distribution in multivariate chemical space was related to RDL, ADMET-score, and the number of rule-of-five exceptions. This multivariate similarity measure was negatively correlated with the QED score for the same metabolite, suggesting that the different approaches capture different aspects of the drug-likeness of individual metabolites. The contrasting of different drug similarity measures can help summarise the range of drug potential in the Cnidaria natural product data set. The most favourable metabolites were around 210-265 Da, quite often sesquiterpenes, with a moderate degree of complexity.

This article covers the conceptual differences between x-CSI and EI approaches, the advantages of x-CSI, constraints on x-CSI system design, and the achievements of x-CSI in AuNP quantification. The results of the review show there are still approximately two orders of magnitude between the AuNP concentrations used in RDEE applications and the demonstrated detection limits of x-CSI. Two approaches to overcome this were suggested: changing AuNP design or changing x-CSI system design. Optimal system parameters for AuNP detection and general spectral performance as determined by simulation studies were different to those used in the current x-CSI systems, indicating potential gains that may be made with this approach.","['ray photon counting spectral imaging', 'still approximately two orders', 'general spectral performance', 'traditional energy integrating', 'optimal system parameters', 'indicating potential gains', 'image gold nanoparticles', 'described oncological applications', 'demonstrated detection limits', 'changing aunp design', 'csi system design', 'csi system design', 'review article offers', 'aunp concentrations used', 'ray imaging', 'two approaches', 'aunp detection', 'rdee applications', 'article covers', 'aunp quantification', 'used clinically', 'simulation studies', 'review show', 'rdee ).', 'radiotherapy dose', 'enhancing effect', 'draw attention', 'clinical use', 'changing x', 'csi systems', 'csi ).', 'ei approaches', 'conceptual differences', 'new technique', 'current x', 'aunp', 'used', 'review', 'csi', 'csi', 'csi', 'csi', 'csi', 'ei', 'differences', 'technique', 'technique', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x', 'work', 'vivo', 'suggested', 'results', 'reader', 'overview', 'overcome', 'need', 'need', 'motivated', 'may', 'magnitude', 'made', 'familiarise', 'different', 'develop', 'determined', 'deliver', 'constraints', 'approach', 'aim', 'advantages', 'achievements']"
"Osteosarcoma is a rare bone cancer which is more common in children than in adults and has a high chance of metastasizing to the patient's lungs. Due to initiated cases, it is difficult to diagnose and hard to detect the nodule in a lung at the early state. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are effectively applied for early state detection by considering CT-scanned images. Transferring patients from small hospitals to the cancer specialized hospital, Lerdsin Hospital, poses difficulties in information sharing because of the privacy and safety regulations. CD-ROM media was allowed for transferring patients' data to Lerdsin Hospital. Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) files cannot be stored on a CD-ROM. DICOM must be converted into other common image formats, such as BMP, JPG and PNG formats. Quality of images can affect the accuracy of the CNN models. In this research, the effect of different image formats is studied and experimented. Three popular medical CNN models, VGG-16, ResNet-50 and MobileNet-V2, are considered and used for osteosarcoma detection. The positive and negative class images are corrected from Lerdsin Hospital, and 80% of all images are used as a training dataset, while the rest are used to validate the trained models. Limited training images are simulated by reducing images in the training dataset. Each model is trained and validated by three different image formats, resulting in 54 testing cases. F1-Score and accuracy are calculated and compared for the models' performance. VGG-16 is the most robust of all the formats. PNG format is the most preferred image format, followed by BMP and JPG formats, respectively.","['three popular medical cnn models', 'three different image formats', 'different image formats', 'rare bone cancer', 'convolutional neural networks', 'preferred image format', '54 testing cases', 'cancer specialized hospital', 'negative class images', 'common image formats', 'early state detection', 'limited training images', 'cnn models', 'early state', 'png formats', 'png format', 'initiated cases', 'training dataset', 'training dataset', 'lerdsin hospital', 'lerdsin hospital', 'lerdsin hospital', 'transferring patients', 'transferring patients', 'trained models', 'small hospitals', 'scanned images', 'safety regulations', 'reducing images', 'poses difficulties', 'osteosarcoma detection', 'jpg formats', 'information sharing', 'high chance', 'files cannot', 'effectively applied', 'digital imaging', 'considering ct', 'rom media', 'dicom must', 'models', 'formats', 'images', 'images', 'common', 'trained', 'rom', 'osteosarcoma', 'jpg', 'dicom', 'vgg', 'vgg', 'validated', 'validate', 'v2', 'used', 'used', 'used', 'studied', 'stored', 'simulated', 'score', 'robust', 'resulting', 'rest', 'respectively', 'resnet', 'research', 'quality', 'privacy', 'positive', 'performance', 'patient', 'nodule', 'model', 'mobilenet', 'metastasizing', 'medicine', 'lungs', 'lung', 'hard', 'followed', 'f1', 'experimented', 'effect', 'due', 'difficult', 'diagnose', 'detect', 'data', 'corrected', 'converted', 'considered', 'compared', 'communications', 'cnns', 'children', 'cd', 'cd', 'calculated', 'bmp', 'bmp', 'allowed', 'affect', 'adults', 'accuracy', 'accuracy', '80', '50', '16', '16']"
"In humans, mirtazapine can prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) and improve cancer patients' quality of life (QoL). This drug is being increasingly used as an appetite stimulant in cats. The hypothesis of this retrospective study was that mirtazapine could reduce the incidence of CINV and weight loss in feline patients affected by lymphoma. The objectives were to report the use of mirtazapine transdermal ointment and assess the incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity and weight loss in cats diagnosed with lymphoma and receiving chemotherapy. Transdermal mirtazapine was topically administered to the inner surface of the pinna (2 mg/cat/daily) for 14 days following chemotherapy administration. Data recorded from 20 patients were collected. Different grades of GI toxicity were shown in 8/20 (40%) patients. Body weight (BW), body condition score (BCS), and muscle condition score (MCS) improved in 12/20 (60%), 6/20 (30%), and 2/20 (10%) cats, respectively. Mirtazapine-induced adverse events (AEs) occurred in 4/20 (20%) cats and did not require mirtazapine discontinuation. Substantial weight loss was not encountered, suggesting that patients had an adequate food intake after chemotherapy administration.

"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults, and over half of patients with newly diagnosed GBM are over the age of 65. Management of glioblastoma in older patients includes maximal safe resection followed by either radiation, chemotherapy, or combined modality treatment. Despite recent advances in the treatment of older patients with GBM, survival is still only approximately 9 months compared to approximately 15 months for the general adult population, suggesting that further research is required to optimize management in the older population. The Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) has been shown to have a prognostic and predictive role in the management of older patients with other cancers, and domains of the CGA have demonstrated an association with outcomes in GBM in retrospective studies. Furthermore, the CGA and other geriatric assessment tools are now starting to be prospectively investigated in older GBM populations. This review aims to outline current treatment strategies for older patients with GBM, explore the rationale for inclusion of geriatric assessment in GBM management, and highlight recent data investigating its implementation into practice.","['older patients includes maximal safe resection followed', 'common primary malignant brain tumor', 'highlight recent data investigating', 'approximately 9 months compared', 'outline current treatment strategies', 'approximately 15 months', 'despite recent advances', 'combined modality treatment', 'general adult population', 'geriatric assessment tools', 'comprehensive geriatric assessment', 'older gbm populations', 'newly diagnosed gbm', 'older patients', 'older patients', 'older patients', 'older population', 'geriatric assessment', 'review aims', 'retrospective studies', 'prospectively investigated', 'predictive role', 'either radiation', 'optimize management', 'gbm management', 'patients', 'treatment', 'gbm', 'gbm', 'gbm', 'gbm', 'management', 'management', 'survival', 'suggesting', 'still', 'starting', 'shown', 'research', 'required', 'rationale', 'prognostic', 'practice', 'outcomes', 'inclusion', 'implementation', 'half', 'glioblastoma', 'glioblastoma', 'furthermore', 'explore', 'domains', 'demonstrated', 'chemotherapy', 'cga', 'cga', 'cga', 'cancers', 'association', 'age', 'adults', '65']"

"Immune-related pneumonitis (IRP) has attracted extensive attention, owing to its increased mortality rate. Conventional chemotherapy (C) has been considered as an immunosuppressive agent and may thus reduce IRP's risk when used in combination with PD-1/L1 inhibitors. This study aimed to assess the risk of IRP with PD-1/L1 inhibitors plus chemotherapy (I+C) versus PD-1/L1 inhibitors alone (I) in solid cancer treatment.
Multiple databases were searched for RCTs before January 2021. This NMA was performed among I+C, I, and C to investigate IRP's risk. Subgroup analysis was carried out on the basis of different PD-1/L1 inhibitors and cancer types.
Thirty-one RCTs (19,624 patients) were included. The I+C group exhibited a lower risk of IRP in any grade (RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.38-0.95) and in grade 3-5 (RR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.21-0.92) as opposed to the I group. The risk of any grade IRP with PD-1 plus chemotherapy was lower than that with PD-1 monotherapy (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28-0.89), although grade 3-5 IRP was similar. There was no statistically meaningful difference in the risk of any grade IRP between PD-L1 plus chemotherapy and PD-L1 inhibitors monotherapy (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.43-2.09) or grade 3-5 IRP (RR, 0.71;95% CI, 0.24-2.07). In addition, compared with the I group, the I+C group was correlated with a decreased risk in IRP regardless of cancer type, while a substantial difference was only observed in NSCLC patients for grade 3-5 IRP (RR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.15-0.98).
In comparison to PD-1/L1 inhibitor treatment alone, combining chemotherapy with PD-1/L1 inhibitors might reduce the risk of IRP in the general population. Furthermore, PD-1 inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy were correlated with a decreased risk of IRP compared to PD-1 inhibitor treatment alone.

"This study aims to provide guidance for the use of neoadjuvant and adjuvant systemic therapy in women with newly diagnosed stage II-IV epithelial ovary, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma.
EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library were investigated for relevant systematic reviews and phase III trials. Articles focusing on consolidation and maintenance therapies were excluded.
For women with potentially resectable disease, primary cytoreductive surgery, followed by six to eight cycles of intravenous three-weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin is recommended. For those with a high-risk profile for primary cytoreductive surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be an option. Adjuvant chemotherapy with six cycles of dose-dense weekly paclitaxel plus three-weekly carboplatin can be considered for women of Japanese descent. In women with stage III or IV disease, the incorporation of bevacizumab concurrent with paclitaxel and carboplatin is not recommended for use as adjuvant therapy unless bevacizumab is continued as maintenance therapy.

"The safety impact of radiotherapy (RT) timing relative to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is unclear. We investigated if RT within 14 days (Interval 1) and 90 days (Interval 2) of ICI use is associated with toxicities compared to RT outside these intervals.
Advanced NSCLC patients treated with both RT and ICIs were reviewed. Toxicities were graded as per CTCAE v4.0 and attributed to either ICIs or RT by clinicians. Associations between RT timing and Grade ≥2 toxicities were analyzed using logistic regression models adjusted for patient, disease, and treatment factors (α = 0.05).
Sixty-four patients were identified. Twenty received RT within Interval 1 and 40 within Interval 2. There were 20 Grade ≥2 toxicities in 18 (28%) patients; pneumonitis (6) and nausea (2) were most prevalent. One treatment-related death (immune encephalitis) was observed. Rates of patients with Grade ≥2 toxicities were 35%/25% in the group with/without RT within Interval 1 and 30%/25% in the group with/without RT within Interval 2. No significant association between RT timing relative to ICI use period and Grade ≥2 toxicities was observed.

"We evaluated the association of pre-treatment immunologic biomarkers on the outcomes of early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).
In this retrospective study, all newly diagnosed early-stage NSCLC treated with SBRT between January 2010 and December 2017 were screened and included for further analysis. The pre-treatment neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte lymphocyte ratio (MLR), and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) were calculated. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were estimated by Kaplan-Meier. Multivariable models were constructed to determine the impact of different biomarkers and the Akaike information criterion (AIC), index of adequacy, and scaled Brier scores were calculated.

"Alarming differences exist in cancer outcomes for people most impacted by persistent and widening health and social inequities. People who are socially disadvantaged often have higher cancer-related mortality and are diagnosed with advanced cancers more often than other people. Such outcomes are linked to the compounding effects of stigma, discrimination, and other barriers, which create persistent inequities in access to care at all points in the cancer trajectory, preventing timely diagnosis and treatment, and further widening the health equity gap. In this commentary, we discuss how growing evidence suggests that people who are considered marginalized are not well-served by the cancer care sector and how the design and structure of services can often impose profound barriers to populations considered socially disadvantaged. We highlight equity-oriented healthcare as one strategy that can begin to address inequities in health outcomes and access to care by taking action to transform organizational cultures and approaches to the design and delivery of cancer services.","['populations considered socially disadvantaged', 'often impose profound barriers', 'socially disadvantaged often', 'transform organizational cultures', 'preventing timely diagnosis', 'growing evidence suggests', 'alarming differences exist', 'health equity gap', 'create persistent inequities', 'cancer care sector', 'considered marginalized', 'highlight equity', 'social inequities', 'address inequities', 'higher cancer', 'cancer trajectory', 'taking action', 'related mortality', 'oriented healthcare', 'one strategy', 'health outcomes', 'compounding effects', 'advanced cancers', 'cancer outcomes', 'widening health', 'cancer services', 'often', 'barriers', 'persistent', 'outcomes', 'care', 'care', 'widening', 'services', 'well', 'treatment', 'structure', 'stigma', 'served', 'points', 'people', 'people', 'people', 'people', 'linked', 'impacted', 'discuss', 'discrimination', 'diagnosed', 'design', 'design', 'delivery', 'commentary', 'begin', 'approaches', 'access', 'access']"
"Intraventricular meningiomas (IVMs) are rare (0.5-5%) and usually low-grade (90% grade I) brain neoplasms. Their recurrence rate is lower than that of extra-axial meningiomas, but their surgical resection can be burdened with life-threatening complications, which represent the major cause of the reported 4% mortality. The aim of this study is to characterize the molecular portrait of IVMs to identify potential therapeutic targets. For this, we explored mutations and copy number variations (CNV) of 409 cancer-related genes and tumor mutational burden (TMB) of six cases, using next-generation sequencing.

"It has been reported that 5.1-7.0% of acute pericarditis are carcinomatous pericarditis. Malignant pericardial effusion (MPE) can progress to cardiac tamponade, which is a life-threatening condition. The effectiveness and feasibility of intrapericardial instillation of carboplatin (CBDCA; 150 mg/body) have never been evaluated in patients with lung cancer, which is the most common cause of MPE. Therefore, we evaluated the effectiveness and feasibility of intrapericardial administration of CBDCA following catheter drainage in patients with lung cancer-associated MPE. In this retrospective study, 21 patients with symptomatic lung cancer-associated MPE, who were administered intrapericardial CBDCA (150 mg/body) at Gunma Prefectural Cancer Center between January 2005 and March 2018, were included. The patients' characteristics, response to treatment, and toxicity incidence were evaluated. Thirty days after the intrapericardial administration of CBDCA, MPE was controlled in 66.7% of the cases. The median survival period from the day of administration until death or last follow-up was 71 days (range: 10-2435 days). Grade 1-2 pain, nausea, fever, and neutropenia were noted after intrapericardial CBDCA administration. No treatment-related deaths were noted in the current study. Intrapericardial administration of CBDCA (150 mg/body) did not cause serious toxicity, and patients exhibited promising responses to lung cancer-associated MPE.

"Uretero-enteric anastomotic strictures (UES) after robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) represent the main cause of post-operative renal dysfunction. The gold standard for treatment of UES is open uretero-ileal reimplantation (UIR), which is often a challenging and complex procedure associated with significant morbidity. We report a challenging case of long severe bilateral UES (5 cm on the left side, 3 cm on the right side) after RARC in a 55 years old male patient who was previously treated in another institution and who came to our attention with kidney dysfunction and bilateral ureteral stents from the previous two years. Difficult multiple ureteral stent placement and substitutions had been previously performed in another hospital, with resulting urinary leakage. An open surgical procedure via an anterior transperitoneal approach was performed at our hospital, which took 10 h to complete, given the massive intestinal and periureteral adhesions, which required very meticulous dissection. A vascular surgeon was called to repair an accidental rupture that had occurred during the dissection of the external left iliac artery, involved in the extensive periureteral inflammatory process. Excision of a segment of the external iliac artery was accomplished, and an interposition graft using a reversed saphenous vein was performed. Bilateral ureteroneocystostomy followed, which required, on the left side, the interposition of a Casati-Boari flap harvested from the neobladder, and on the right side a neobladder-psoas-hitching procedure with intramucosal direct ureteral reimplantation. The patient recovered well and is currently in good health, as determined at his recent 24-month follow-up visit. No signs of relapse of the strictures or other complications were detected. Bilateral ureteral reimplantation after robotic radical cystectomy is a complex procedure that should be restricted to high-volume centers, where multidisciplinary teams are available, including urologists, endourologists, and general and vascular surgeons.","['difficult multiple ureteral stent placement', '55 years old male patient', 'extensive periureteral inflammatory process', 'intramucosal direct ureteral reimplantation', 'open surgical procedure via', 'long severe bilateral ues', 'external left iliac artery', 'external iliac artery', 'previous two years', 'patient recovered well', 'bilateral ureteral stents', 'bilateral ureteral reimplantation', 'bilateral ureteroneocystostomy followed', 'took 10 h', 'robotic radical cystectomy', 'reversed saphenous vein', 'resulting urinary leakage', 'boari flap harvested', 'assisted radical cystectomy', 'anterior transperitoneal approach', 'operative renal dysfunction', 'complex procedure associated', 'interposition graft using', 'enteric anastomotic strictures', 'complex procedure', 'periureteral adhesions', 'ileal reimplantation', 'hitching procedure', 'left side', 'left side', 'open uretero', 'kidney dysfunction', 'volume centers', 'vascular surgeons', 'vascular surgeon', 'uir ),', 'significant morbidity', 'right side', 'right side', 'recent 24', 'previously treated', 'multidisciplinary teams', 'month follow', 'massive intestinal', 'main cause', 'including urologists', 'good health', 'gold standard', 'another institution', 'accidental rupture', '5 cm', '3 cm', 'meticulous dissection', 'challenging case', 'another hospital', 'previously performed', 'ues', 'ues', 'strictures', 'interposition', 'uretero', 'hospital', 'dissection', 'challenging', 'performed', 'performed', 'visit', 'treatment', 'substitutions', 'signs', 'segment', 'robot', 'restricted', 'required', 'required', 'represent', 'report', 'repair', 'relapse', 'rarc', 'rarc', 'psoas', 'post', 'often', 'occurred', 'neobladder', 'neobladder', 'involved', 'high', 'given', 'general', 'excision', 'endourologists', 'determined', 'detected', 'currently', 'complications', 'complete', 'casati', 'came', 'called', 'available', 'attention', 'accomplished']"

"Given that the health care system for Indigenous people tends to be complex, fragmented, and multi-jurisdictional, their cancer experiences may be especially difficult. This needs assessment study examined system-level barriers and community strengths regarding cancer care experiences of Indigenous people in Saskatchewan. Guided by an advisory committee including Indigenous patient and family partners, we conducted key informant interviews with senior Saskatchewan health care administrators and Indigenous leaders to identify supports and barriers. A sharing circle with patients, survivors, and family members was used to gather cancer journey experiences from Indigenous communities from northern Saskatchewan. Analyses were presented to the committee for recommendations. Key informants identified cancer support barriers including access to care, coordination of care, a lack of culturally relevant health care provision, and education. Sharing circle participants discussed strengths and protective factors such as kinship, connection to culture, and spirituality. Indigenous patient navigation, inter-organization collaboration, and community relationship building were recommended to ameliorate barriers and bolster strengths. Recognizing barriers to access, coordination, culturally relevant health care provision, and education can further champion community strengths and protective factors and frame effective cancer care strategies and equitable cancer care for Indigenous people in Saskatchewan.","['key informants identified cancer support barriers including access', 'community strengths regarding cancer care experiences', 'needs assessment study examined system', 'frame effective cancer care strategies', 'culturally relevant health care provision', 'culturally relevant health care provision', 'advisory committee including indigenous patient', 'sharing circle participants discussed strengths', 'senior saskatchewan health care administrators', 'conducted key informant interviews', 'gather cancer journey experiences', 'health care system', 'cancer experiences may', 'equitable cancer care', 'champion community strengths', 'community relationship building', 'indigenous patient navigation', 'indigenous people tends', 'sharing circle', 'bolster strengths', 'indigenous people', 'indigenous people', 'recognizing barriers', 'level barriers', 'ameliorate barriers', 'indigenous leaders', 'indigenous communities', 'access', 'northern saskatchewan', 'protective factors', 'protective factors', 'organization collaboration', 'identify supports', 'family partners', 'family members', 'especially difficult', 'care', 'care', 'committee', 'barriers', 'saskatchewan', 'saskatchewan', 'used', 'survivors', 'spirituality', 'recommended', 'recommendations', 'presented', 'patients', 'multi', 'lack', 'kinship', 'jurisdictional', 'inter', 'guided', 'given', 'fragmented', 'education', 'education', 'culture', 'coordination', 'coordination', 'connection', 'complex', 'analyses']"

"Having a life partner significantly extends survival for most cancer patients. The label given to the partners of cancer patients may, however, influence the health of not just the patients but their partners. ""Caregiver"" is an increasingly common label for the partners of patients, but it carries an implicit burden. Referring to partners as ""caregivers"" may be detrimental to the partnerships, as it implies that the individuals are no longer able to be co-supportive. Recognizing this, there has been some effort to relabel cancer dyads as ""co-survivors"". However, many cancer patients are not comfortable being called a ""survivor"", and the same may apply to their partners. Cancer survivorship, we argue, could be enhanced by helping keep the bond between patients and their partners strong. This includes educating patients and partners about diverse coping strategies that individuals use when facing challenges to their health and wellbeing.

"Rhabdoid tumors (RT) are among the most aggressive tumors in early childhood. Overall survival remains poor, and treatment only effectively occurs at the cost of high toxicity and late adverse effects. It has been reported that the neurokinin-1 receptor/ substance P complex plays an important role in cancer and proved to be a promising target. However, its role in RT has not yet been described. This study aims to determine whether the neurokinin-1 receptor is expressed in RT and whether neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) antagonists can serve as a novel therapeutic approach in treating RTs. By in silico analysis using the cBio Cancer Genomics Portal we found that RTs highly express neurokinin-1 receptor. We confirmed these results by RT-PCR in both tumor cell lines and in human tissue samples of various affected organs. We demonstrated a growth inhibitory and apoptotic effect of aprepitant in viability assays and flow cytometry. Furthermore, this effect proved to remain when used in combination with the cytostatic cisplatin. Western blot analysis showed an upregulation of apoptotic signaling pathways in rhabdoid tumors when treated with aprepitant. Overall, our findings suggest that NK1R may be a promising target for the treatment of RT in combination with other anti-cancer therapies and can be targeted with the NK1R antagonist aprepitant.","['substance p complex plays', 'western blot analysis showed', 'overall survival remains poor', 'cbio cancer genomics portal', 'rts highly express neurokinin', 'silico analysis using', 'various affected organs', 'tumor cell lines', 'novel therapeutic approach', 'late adverse effects', 'human tissue samples', 'apoptotic signaling pathways', 'nk1r antagonist aprepitant', 'treating rts', 'apoptotic effect', 'cancer therapies', 'whether neurokinin', 'viability assays', 'study aims', 'rhabdoid tumors', 'rhabdoid tumors', 'promising target', 'promising target', 'nk1r may', 'high toxicity', 'growth inhibitory', 'flow cytometry', 'findings suggest', 'effectively occurs', 'early childhood', 'determine whether', 'cytostatic cisplatin', 'aggressive tumors', '1 receptor', '1 receptor', '1 receptor', '1 receptor', 'important role', 'effect proved', 'overall', 'cancer', 'nk1r', 'neurokinin', 'neurokinin', 'aprepitant', 'aprepitant', 'role', 'proved', 'yet', 'used', 'upregulation', 'treatment', 'treatment', 'treated', 'targeted', 'serve', 'rt', 'rt', 'rt', 'rt', 'rt', 'results', 'reported', 'remain', 'pcr', 'however', 'furthermore', 'found', 'expressed', 'described', 'demonstrated', 'cost', 'confirmed', 'combination', 'combination', 'anti', 'antagonists', 'among']"
"Lung cancer ranks first in the incidence and mortality of cancer in the world, of which more than 80% are non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The majority of NSCLC patients are in stage IIIB~IV when they are admitted to hospital and have no opportunity for surgery. Compared with traditional chemotherapy, specific targeted therapy has a higher selectivity and fewer adverse reactions, providing a new treatment direction for advanced NSCLC patients. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR-TKIs) are the widely used targeted therapy for NSCLC patients. Their efficacy and prognosis are closely related to the mutation status of the EGFR gene. Clinically, detecting EGFR gene mutation is often limited by difficulty obtaining tissue specimens, limited detecting technology, and economic conditions, so it is of great clinical significance to find indicators to predict EGFR gene mutation status. Clinicopathological characteristics, tumor markers, liquid biopsy, and other predictors are less invasive, economical, and easier to obtain. They can be monitored in real-time, which is supposed to predict EGFR mutation status and provide guidance for the accurate, individualized diagnosis and therapy of NSCLC patients.

"(1) Background: To date, data addressing the antibody response of cancer patients to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are limited. To our knowledge, this is the first report to evaluate humoral immunity. responses in Canadian cancer patients. (2) Methods: 116 cancer patients and 35 healthy participants were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. The interval between the first and second doses were closely matched during analysis.

"Immune checkpoint inhibitors have transformed the treatment of metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, yielding marked improvements in survival and the potential for durable clinical responses. Primary and acquired resistance to current immune checkpoint inhibitors constitute a key challenge despite the remarkable responses observed in a subset of patients. Multiple novel combination immunotherapy and adoptive cell therapy strategies are presently being developed to address treatment resistance. The success of these strategies hinges upon rational clinical trial design as well as careful consideration of the immunologic mechanisms within the variable tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) which underpin resistance to immunotherapy. Further research is needed to facilitate a deeper understanding of these complex mechanisms within the TIME, which may ultimately provide the key to restoring and enhancing an effective anti-tumor immune response. This review aims to provide an introduction to some of the recent and notable combination immunotherapy and cell therapy strategies used in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the rationale for their use based on current understanding of the anti-tumor immune response and mechanisms of resistance within the TIME.","['strategies hinges upon rational clinical trial design', 'current immune checkpoint inhibitors constitute', 'cell therapy strategies used', 'adoptive cell therapy strategies', 'variable tumor immune microenvironment', 'multiple novel combination immunotherapy', 'immune checkpoint inhibitors', 'durable clinical responses', 'tumor immune response', 'tumor immune response', 'cell lung cancer', 'cell lung cancer', 'notable combination immunotherapy', 'yielding marked improvements', 'remarkable responses observed', 'may ultimately provide', 'key challenge despite', 'immunologic mechanisms within', 'complex mechanisms within', 'address treatment resistance', 'current understanding', 'resistance within', 'underpin resistance', 'acquired resistance', 'use based', 'review aims', 'nsclc ),', 'metastatic non', 'deeper understanding', 'careful consideration', 'advanced non', 'effective anti', 'immunotherapy', 'mechanisms', 'treatment', 'provide', 'key', 'anti', 'well', 'transformed', 'time', 'time', 'time', 'survival', 'success', 'subset', 'small', 'small', 'restoring', 'research', 'recent', 'rationale', 'primary', 'presently', 'potential', 'patients', 'needed', 'introduction', 'facilitate', 'enhancing', 'developed']"

"When managing older patients with lower-risk hormone-receptor-positive (HR+), HER2 negative (HER2-) early-stage breast cancer (EBC), the harms and benefits of adjuvant therapies should be taken into consideration. A survey was conducted among Canadian oncologists on the definitions of ""low risk"" and ""older"", practice patterns, and future trial designs. We contacted 254 physicians and 21% completed the survey (50/242). Most respondents (68%, 34/50) agreed with the definition of ""low risk"" HR+/HER2- EBC being node-negative and either: ≤3 cm and low histological grade, ≤2 cm and intermediate grade, or ≤1 cm and high grade. The most popular chronological and biological age definition for older patients was ≥70 (45%, 22/49; 45% 21/47).

"Cancer is the top cause of death globally. Developing smart nanomedicines that are capable of diagnosis and therapy (theranostics) in one-nanoparticle systems are highly desirable for improving cancer treatment outcomes. The magnetic nanoplatforms are the ideal system for cancer theranostics, because of their diverse physiochemical properties and biological effects. In particular, a biocompatible iron oxide nanoparticle based magnetic nanoplatform can exhibit multiple magnetic-responsive behaviors under an external magnetic field and realize the integration of diagnosis (magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonic imaging, photoacoustic imaging, etc.) and therapy (magnetic hyperthermia, photothermal therapy, controlled drug delivery and release, etc.) in vivo. Furthermore, due to considerable variation among tumors and individual patients, it is a requirement to design iron oxide nanoplatforms by the coordination of diverse functionalities for efficient and individualized theranostics. In this article, we will present an up-to-date overview on iron oxide nanoplatforms, including both iron oxide nanomaterials and those that can respond to an externally applied magnetic field, with an emphasis on their applications in cancer theranostics.","['biocompatible iron oxide nanoparticle based magnetic nanoplatform', 'considerable variation among tumors', 'design iron oxide nanoplatforms', 'externally applied magnetic field', 'improving cancer treatment outcomes', 'iron oxide nanoplatforms', 'iron oxide nanomaterials', 'external magnetic field', 'exhibit multiple magnetic', 'developing smart nanomedicines', 'controlled drug delivery', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'diverse physiochemical properties', 'nanoparticle systems', 'magnetic nanoplatforms', 'magnetic hyperthermia', 'diverse functionalities', 'ultrasonic imaging', 'photoacoustic imaging', 'top cause', 'responsive behaviors', 'individual patients', 'ideal system', 'highly desirable', 'etc .)', 'etc .)', 'death globally', 'date overview', 'cancer theranostics', 'cancer theranostics', 'biological effects', 'individualized theranostics', 'photothermal therapy', 'cancer', 'theranostics', 'therapy', 'therapy', 'vivo', 'respond', 'requirement', 'release', 'realize', 'present', 'particular', 'one', 'integration', 'including', 'furthermore', 'emphasis', 'efficient', 'due', 'diagnosis', 'diagnosis', 'coordination', 'capable', 'article', 'applications']"
"SERS immunoassay biosensors hold immense potential for clinical diagnostics due to their high sensitivity and growing interest in multi-marker panels. However, their development has been hindered by difficulties in designing compatible extrinsic Raman labels. Prior studies have largely focused on spectroscopic characteristics in selecting Raman reporter molecules (RRMs) for multiplexing since the presence of well-differentiated spectra is essential for simultaneous detection. However, these candidates often induce aggregation of the gold nanoparticles used as SERS nanotags despite their similarity to other effective RRMs. Thus, an improved understanding of factors affecting the aggregation of RRM-coated gold nanoparticles is needed. Substituent electronic effects on particle stability were investigated using various para-substituted thiophenols. The inductive and resonant effects of functional group modifications were strongly correlated with nanoparticle surface charge and hence their stability. Treatment with thiophenols diminished the negative surface charge of citrate-stabilized gold nanoparticles, but electron-withdrawing substituents limited the magnitude of this diminishment. It is proposed that this phenomenon arises by affecting the interplay of competing sulfur binding modes. This has wide-reaching implications for the design of biosensors using thiol-modified gold surfaces. A proof-of-concept multiplexed SERS biosensor was designed according to these findings using the two thiophenol compounds with the most electron-withdrawing substitutions: NO","['sers immunoassay biosensors hold immense potential', 'designing compatible extrinsic raman labels', 'selecting raman reporter molecules', 'concept multiplexed sers biosensor', 'competing sulfur binding modes', 'investigated using various para', 'candidates often induce aggregation', 'biosensors using thiol', 'sers nanotags despite', 'two thiophenol compounds', 'stabilized gold nanoparticles', 'negative surface charge', 'nanoparticle surface charge', 'modified gold surfaces', 'gold nanoparticles used', 'functional group modifications', 'coated gold nanoparticles', 'clinical diagnostics due', 'withdrawing substituents limited', 'substituent electronic effects', 'findings using', 'withdrawing substitutions', 'resonant effects', 'thiophenols diminished', 'substituted thiophenols', 'strongly correlated', 'spectroscopic characteristics', 'simultaneous detection', 'reaching implications', 'prior studies', 'phenomenon arises', 'multiplexing since', 'marker panels', 'largely focused', 'improved understanding', 'high sensitivity', 'growing interest', 'differentiated spectra', 'designed according', 'particle stability', 'factors affecting', 'effective rrms', 'aggregation', 'stability', 'rrms', 'affecting', 'wide', 'well', 'treatment', 'thus', 'similarity', 'rrm', 'proposed', 'proof', 'presence', 'needed', 'multi', 'magnitude', 'interplay', 'inductive', 'however', 'however', 'hindered', 'hence', 'essential', 'electron', 'electron', 'diminishment', 'difficulties', 'development', 'design', 'citrate']"
"Non-fluidic array SPR imaging (SPRi) with appropriate biosensors is a new tool for the determination of various biomarkers in body fluids. Numerous biomarkers can be determined without signal enhancement or preliminarily preconcentration. The introduction of a new material solution of the chip may increase the scope of the application of this technique. Solutions with adhesive separating foil and an Ag/Au chip were compared with the previously used two-paint separating polymer and pure gold chip. These solutions were tested using the example of a biosensor for cathepsin D (Cath D), which consisted of pepstatin A (a Cath D inhibitor) immobilized via a cysteamine linker using the NHS/EDC protocol. Four material versions of the Cath D biosensor proved adequate in terms of range of linearity, LOQ, precision and recovery. All four versions of the biosensor were used for the determination of Cath D in the blood serum patients with glioblastoma and control samples, producing very similar results and showing an elevated biomarker concentration in the case of cancer. Therefore, the problem of determining the correct level of Cath D in the serum of healthy individuals has been resolved, correcting literature data which ranged over three orders of magnitude.","['fluidic array spr imaging', 'determined without signal enhancement', 'paint separating polymer', 'elevated biomarker concentration', 'correcting literature data', 'adhesive separating foil', 'pure gold chip', 'chip may increase', 'new material solution', 'cysteamine linker using', 'previously used two', 'four material versions', 'blood serum patients', 'biosensor proved adequate', 'four versions', 'au chip', 'tested using', 'new tool', 'various biomarkers', 'three orders', 'similar results', 'preliminarily preconcentration', 'numerous biomarkers', 'immobilized via', 'healthy individuals', 'edc protocol', 'correct level', 'control samples', 'body fluids', 'appropriate biosensors', 'used', 'serum', 'biosensor', 'biosensor', 'therefore', 'terms', 'technique', 'spri', 'solutions', 'solutions', 'showing', 'scope', 'resolved', 'recovery', 'ranged', 'range', 'producing', 'problem', 'precision', 'pepstatin', 'non', 'nhs', 'magnitude', 'loq', 'linearity', 'introduction', 'inhibitor', 'glioblastoma', 'example', 'determining', 'determination', 'determination', 'consisted', 'compared', 'cathepsin', 'cath', 'cath', 'cath', 'cath', 'cath', 'case', 'cancer', 'application', 'ag', '),']"

Sociodemographic (age of diagnosis, gender, marital and occupational status, educational level, having children) and clinical (type and side of surgery, previous breast surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy and axillary dissection) characteristics were investigated through a semi-structured interview. The following rating scales were administered: Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Hopelessness Scale, and Perceived Stress Scale. Our findings indicate that the presence of children and of a partner was associated with a lower total score on the clinical dimensions evaluated.

The creation of a central platform prototype requires the collaboration of several independent market contenders, including medical users, software developers, medical device manufacturers, and platform providers. A dedicated consortium of clinical and scientific partners as well as industry partners was set up.
We demonstrate the successful development of the prototype of a user-centric, open, and extensible platform for the intelligent support of processes starting with the operating room. By connecting heterogeneous data sources and medical devices from different manufacturers and making them accessible for software developers and medical users, the cloud-based platform OP 4.1 enables the augmentation of medical devices and procedures through software-based solutions. The platform also allows for the demand-oriented billing of apps and medical devices, thus permitting software-based solutions to fast-track their economic development and become commercially successful.
The technology and business platform OP 4.1 creates a multisided market for the successful development, implementation, distribution, and billing of new software solutions in the operating room and in the health care sector in general. Consequently, software-based medical innovation can be translated into clinical routine quickly, efficiently, and cost-effectively, optimizing the treatment of patients through smartly assisted procedures.","['concept project op 4', 'several independent market contenders', 'central platform prototype requires', 'business platform op 4', 'based platform op 4', 'connecting heterogeneous data sources', 'platform also allows', 'smart connected devices', 'become commercially successful', 'thus permitting software', 'based medical innovation', 'smartly assisted procedures', 'medical device manufacturers', 'including medical users', 'health care sector', 'clinical routine quickly', 'augmenting medical devices', 'medical device data', 'new software solutions', 'innovative software solutions', 'industry 4', 'platform providers', 'medical users', 'health care', 'extensible platform', 'commercial platform', 'business viability', 'based solutions', 'based solutions', 'medical devices', 'medical devices', 'medical devices', 'innovative solutions', 'multisided market', 'market entry', 'based technologies', 'medical environment', 'different manufacturers', 'software developers', 'software developers', 'software add', 'successful development', 'successful development', 'various industries', 'scientific partners', 'proprietary systems', 'processes starting', 'operating room', 'operating room', 'intelligent support', 'industry partners', 'high barriers', 'giving companies', 'difficult access', 'dedicated consortium', 'although digital', 'economic development', '1 enables', '1 creates', 'oriented billing', 'prototype', 'connecting', 'data', 'data', 'software', 'software', 'procedures', 'clinical', 'development', '1', 'billing', 'billing', 'widespread', 'well', 'user', 'use', 'treatment', 'translated', 'track', 'technology', 'technical', 'still', 'show', 'set', 'proof', 'patients', 'optimizing', 'open', 'ons', 'making', 'infancy', 'implementation', 'implementation', 'general', 'fast', 'efficiently', 'effectively', 'distribution', 'distribution', 'demonstrate', 'demand', 'creation', 'cost', 'context', 'consequently', 'collaboration', 'cloud', 'centric', 'augmentation', 'apps', 'affected', 'accessible', '0']"
"Despite an unprecedented global research effort on SARS-CoV-2, early replication events remain poorly understood. Given the clinical importance of emergent viral variants with increased transmission, there is an urgent need to understand the early stages of viral replication and transcription. We used single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridisation (smFISH) to quantify positive sense RNA genomes with 95% detection efficiency, while simultaneously visualising negative sense genomes, subgenomic RNAs, and viral proteins. Our absolute quantification of viral RNAs and replication factories revealed that SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA is long-lived after entry, suggesting that it avoids degradation by cellular nucleases. Moreover, we observed that SARS-CoV-2 replication is highly variable between cells, with only a small cell population displaying high burden of viral RNA. Unexpectedly, the B.1.1.7 variant, first identified in the UK, exhibits significantly slower replication kinetics than the Victoria strain, suggesting a novel mechanism contributing to its higher transmissibility with important clinical implications.","['small cell population displaying high burden', 'early replication events remain poorly understood', 'simultaneously visualising negative sense genomes', 'exhibits significantly slower replication kinetics', 'quantify positive sense rna genomes', 'unprecedented global research effort', 'replication factories revealed', 'novel mechanism contributing', 'important clinical implications', '2 genomic rna', 'emergent viral variants', 'early stages', 'viral replication', '2 replication', 'viral rna', 'clinical importance', 'viral rnas', 'viral proteins', 'victoria strain', 'used single', 'urgent need', 'subgenomic rnas', 'situ hybridisation', 'molecule fluorescence', 'increased transmission', 'highly variable', 'higher transmissibility', 'first identified', 'detection efficiency', 'cellular nucleases', 'avoids degradation', 'absolute quantification', '7 variant', '2', 'unexpectedly', 'understand', 'uk', 'transcription', 'suggesting', 'suggesting', 'smfish', 'sars', 'sars', 'sars', 'observed', 'moreover', 'long', 'lived', 'given', 'entry', 'despite', 'cov', 'cov', 'cov', 'cells', 'b', '95', '1', '1']"

"Lung cancer is a malignant tumor with a high incidence in China, especially non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is the main threat to human life, with terrible morbidity and mortality. The research on the treatment and mechanism of NSCLC has been the forefront and hotspot of research. Recent patents shows that alpha-solanine (α-solanine) exhibits the best anti-cancer activity, although its target and related mechanism remain to be elucidated.
This study aims to explore the possible targets and mechanisms of α-solanine in the treatment of NSCLC through network pharmacology and experimental verification.
Network pharmacology was applied to screen the possible targets of α-solanine on NSCLC, construct core networks, and perform GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis, to predict the mechanism of α-solanine against NSCLC. Experiments were implemented to verify the results of network pharmacology in vitro. The A549 and PC-9 cells were exposed to α-solanine to assess the antitumor effect. Cell apoptosis was determined by the Annexin-V/PI assay. Targeted energy metabolomics was used to further validate the results in network pharmacology and energy metabolism pathway-related proteins were detected by immunofluorescence and western blot.
Network pharmacology showed that there were 130 potential targets of α-solanine and NSCLC. GO and KEGG analysis showed that the energy metabolism pathway is the main pathway for α-solanine to exert anti-tumor effects on NSCLC. Experimental results showed that α-solanine inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and promoted cell apoptosis. At the same time, after α-solanine treatment, the expression of the energy metabolism pathway-related proteins including GPI, ALDOA, TPI1, PKLR, LDHA and ALDH3 was reduced. In addition, α-solanine also affects the amino acid metabolism of A549 and PC-9 cells.
Based on a combination of network pharmacological prediction and experimental verification, α-solanine may exert anti-NSCLC effects by regulating the energy metabolism pathway.","['related proteins including gpi', 'solanine inhibited cell proliferation', 'small cell lung cancer', 'solanine may exert anti', 'targeted energy metabolomics', 'recent patents shows', 'kegg analysis showed', 'construct core networks', 'amino acid metabolism', 'kegg pathway analysis', 'energy metabolism pathway', 'energy metabolism pathway', 'energy metabolism pathway', 'energy metabolism pathway', 'promoted cell apoptosis', 'network pharmacological prediction', '130 potential targets', 'perform go enrichment', 'solanine also affects', 'related mechanism remain', 'network pharmacology showed', 'experimental results showed', 'related proteins', 'cell apoptosis', 'lung cancer', 'exert anti', 'main pathway', 'cancer activity', 'best anti', 'network pharmacology', 'network pharmacology', 'network pharmacology', 'network pharmacology', 'possible targets', 'possible targets', 'experimental verification', 'experimental verification', 'western blot', 'tumor effects', 'terrible morbidity', 'study aims', 'pi assay', 'malignant tumor', 'main threat', 'human life', 'high incidence', 'especially non', 'antitumor effect', '9 cells', '9 cells', 'nsclc effects', 'nsclc ),', 'solanine treatment', 'go', 'solanine', 'solanine', 'solanine', 'solanine', 'solanine', 'solanine', 'solanine', 'solanine', 'results', 'results', 'mechanism', 'mechanism', 'treatment', 'treatment', 'nsclc', 'nsclc', 'nsclc', 'nsclc', 'nsclc', 'nsclc', 'α', 'α', 'α', 'α', 'α', 'α', 'α', 'α', 'α', 'α', 'α', 'vitro', 'verify', 'validate', 'v', 'used', 'tpi1', 'time', 'target', 'screen', 'research', 'research', 'regulating', 'reduced', 'predict', 'pklr', 'pc', 'pc', 'mortality', 'migration', 'mechanisms', 'ldha', 'invasion', 'implemented', 'immunofluorescence', 'hotspot', 'forefront', 'expression', 'exposed', 'explore', 'experiments', 'exhibits', 'elucidated', 'determined', 'detected', 'combination', 'china', 'based', 'assess', 'applied', 'annexin', 'although', 'alpha', 'aldoa', 'aldh3', 'addition', 'a549', 'a549']"
"Garcinia mangostana, commonly also called mangosteen, is an evergreen tropical tree, and its pericarps have been used in traditional herbal medicine for different diseases. The anticancer efficacy of the ethanolic extract from pericarps of Garcinia mangostana was investigated in human prostate cancer cells (PC3), melanoma cells (B16F10), breast cancer cells (MCF7) and glioblastoma (U87) cell lines.
3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to measure cell viability. propidium iodide (PI) staining and analysis on a flow cytometer was used to identify apoptosis. Action on cell migration was evaluated by scratch assay and gelatin zymography. Furthermore, the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione (GSH), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was measured. Moreover, we investigated the synergistic efficacy with several combinations of Garcinia mangostana extract (GME) with doxorubicin.
GME reduced cell viability in malignant cell dose and time-dependently. GME-induced sub-G1 peak in flow cytometry histogram of treated cells control representing apoptotic cell death is involved in GME toxicity. Furthermore, GME exhibited inhibitory effects on the migration ability of U87 cells, which was accompanied by inhibition in the activity and expression of MMP2 (matrix metalloproteinase-2). Besides, GSH level and SOD activity was significantly reduced while there was an increase in ROS and MDA concentration following 24 hr GME treatment. Moreover, combination of GME (1.5-25μg/mL) with Dox (6 µg/mL) displayed synergistic efficacy and cell growth inhibition.
In conclusion, GME could cause cell death in PC3, MCF7, U87, and B16F10 cell lines, in which apoptosis plays an imperative role. Plant extract decreased the migration ability of the cells by inhibiting the activity and expression of Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).

"Female reproductive tract cancers like ovarian, cervical, vaginal, etc. have led to a serious concern for reproductive health as well as an increase in physical and psychological stresses amongst women. Various conventional techniques like surgery, radiation and chemotherapy are employed but possess limitations such as organ toxicity, infection, nausea, vomiting, etc. Also, several nanotechnology-based synthetic vehicle delivery systems like liposomes, nanoparticles, etc. are used but they lack targeting efficiency that results in poor propulsion and control. Therefore, there is a need for naturally-driven drug carriers to overcome such limitations. Sperm-based drug delivery is the new area for targeted delivery that offers self-propulsion to tumor sites, higher biocompatibility, longer lifespan and increased tissue penetration with enhanced localization. Drug-loaded sperm cells are harnessed with micro/nanomotor that will guide them to the intended target site. The critical analysis of the sperm-based drug delivery system was executed and summarized along with the current challenges. This article deals with the art of delivering the anticancer drug to female reproductive cancer sites with proof-of-concept-based research data and critical discussion on challenges in formulating the sperm-based delivery with a future perspective.","['based synthetic vehicle delivery systems like liposomes', 'female reproductive tract cancers like ovarian', 'various conventional techniques like surgery', 'psychological stresses amongst women', 'female reproductive cancer sites', 'based drug delivery system', 'based drug delivery', 'based research data', 'lack targeting efficiency', 'intended target site', 'increased tissue penetration', 'driven drug carriers', 'loaded sperm cells', 'based delivery', 'reproductive health', 'targeted delivery', 'tumor sites', 'anticancer drug', 'summarized along', 'several nanotechnology', 'serious concern', 'organ toxicity', 'offers self', 'new area', 'longer lifespan', 'higher biocompatibility', 'future perspective', 'enhanced localization', 'critical discussion', 'critical analysis', 'article deals', 'possess limitations', 'poor propulsion', 'current challenges', 'drug', 'sperm', 'sperm', 'sperm', 'propulsion', 'limitations', 'challenges', 'well', 'vomiting', 'vaginal', 'used', 'therefore', 'results', 'radiation', 'proof', 'physical', 'overcome', 'need', 'nausea', 'naturally', 'nanoparticles', 'nanomotor', 'micro', 'led', 'infection', 'increase', 'harnessed', 'guide', 'formulating', 'executed', 'etc', 'etc', 'etc', 'employed', 'delivering', 'control', 'concept', 'chemotherapy', 'cervical', 'art', 'also']"
"HER2 over-expression plays a crucial role in the cancer treatment protocol. This study evaluates the effectiveness of kidney organic anion and cation transport inhibitors on the tumor uptake of 99mTc-HYNIC-(Ser)3-LTVPWY radiotracer in SKOV-3 tumor-bearing nude mice.
Before the injection of the radiolabeled peptide, SKOV-3 tumor-bearing nude mice were treated with furosemide, cimetidine, para-amino hippuric acid, and saline. The inhibition effects of the organic anion and cation transport inhibitors were compared with the control group. In both treatment and control groups, the tumor and renal accumulation of radiopeptide in mice bearing SKOV-3 tumors were assessed in biodistribution and SPECT imaging studies.
The biodistribution and imaging results suggested that all treated groups showed a higher tumor and higher normal tissue radioactivity compared to the control group. According to the tumor imaging study, the furosemide-treated group had slightly better tumor uptake and a higher tumor to muscle uptake ratio than the other treatment groups.
Administration of furosemide (an OAT inhibitor) increased radioactivity accumulation in the kidneys and blood and improved tumor radioactivity uptake. PAH (an anion transporter substrate) and cimetidine (an OCT inhibitor) have a minor effect on the accumulation of radioactivity in the kidneys and the acquired images.","['higher normal tissue radioactivity compared', 'slightly better tumor uptake', 'improved tumor radioactivity uptake', 'muscle uptake ratio', 'spect imaging studies', 'imaging results suggested', 'hynic -( ser', 'cation transport inhibitors', 'cation transport inhibitors', 'bearing nude mice', 'bearing nude mice', 'amino hippuric acid', 'anion transporter substrate', 'increased radioactivity accumulation', 'kidney organic anion', 'cancer treatment protocol', 'tumor imaging study', 'mice bearing skov', 'treated groups showed', 'tumor uptake', 'higher tumor', 'higher tumor', 'organic anion', 'study evaluates', 'treatment groups', 'control groups', '3 tumor', '3 tumor', 'treated group', 'renal accumulation', 'radiolabeled peptide', 'oct inhibitor', 'oat inhibitor', 'minor effect', 'ltvpwy radiotracer', 'inhibition effects', 'expression plays', 'crucial role', 'control group', 'control group', 'acquired images', '3 tumors', 'radioactivity', 'compared', 'tumor', 'treatment', 'treated', 'accumulation', '3', 'skov', 'skov', 'saline', 'radiopeptide', 'para', 'pah', 'kidneys', 'kidneys', 'injection', 'her2', 'furosemide', 'furosemide', 'furosemide', 'effectiveness', 'cimetidine', 'cimetidine', 'blood', 'biodistribution', 'biodistribution', 'assessed', 'administration', 'according', '99mtc']"
"To investigate the effects of the Lenvatinib@H-MnO2-FA administration system on the proliferation and apoptosis of Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and the underlying molecular mechanism.
In this research, hollow MnO2 (H-MnO2) was synthesized via the modified Stöber method, and H-MnO2 was modified with polyethylene glycol-bis (Amine) (NH2-PEG-NH2) and folic acid (FA) to obtain H-MnO2-PEG-FA (H-MnO2-FA). Lenvatinib was coated in the hollow cavity of H-MnO2-PEG-FA to further form a nanometre drug-carrying system (lenvatinib@H-MnO2-PEG-FA). Lenvatinib@H-MnO2-FA was characterized through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used to verify that Lenvatinib was loaded on nanoparticles. Functionally, confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), 2-(4-Amidinophenyl)-6-indolecarbamidine dihydrochloride (DAPI) staining, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay were performed to determine the effect of lenvatinib@H-MnO2-FA on the proliferation and apoptosis of ICC cells (9810 cells). Finally, the protein levels of Raf-1MEK1/2-ERK1/2 signalling pathway components were detected through Western blotting analysis.
We successfully synthesised a Lenvatinib@H-MnO2-PEG-FA administration system. The resulting nanomaterials had excellent biological stability and improved targeting effects. Functionally, lenvatinib@H-MnO2-FA inhibited the proliferation of 9810 cells. The Bcl-2 protein level was significantly downregulated, and the caspase-3 protein level was significantly upregulated, indicating that lenvatinib@H-MnO2-PEG-FA promoted the apoptosis of 9810 cells. Mechanistically, Lenvatinib@H-MnO2-FA increased the phosphorylation levels of Raf, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2.

"Regenerative medicine based on stem cell research has the potential to provide advanced health care for human beings. Recent studies demonstrate that stem cells in human urine can serve as an excellent source of graft cells for regenerative therapy, mainly due to simple, low-cost, and noninvasive cell isolation. These cells, termed human urine-derived stem cells (USCs), are highly expandable and can differentiate into various cell lineages. They share many biological properties with mesenchymal stem cells, such as potent paracrine effects and immunomodulation ability. The advantage of USCs has motivated researchers to explore their applications in regenerative medicine, including genitourinary regeneration, musculoskeletal repair, skin wound healing, and disease treatment. Although USCs have showed many positive outcomes in preclinical studies, and although the possible applications of USCs for animal therapy have been reported, many issues need to be addressed before clinical translation. This article provides a comprehensive review of USC biology and recent advances in their application for tissue regeneration. Challenges in the clinical translation of USC-based therapy are also discussed. Impact statement Recently, stem cells isolated from urine, referred to as urine-derived stem cells (USCs), have gained much interest in the field of regenerative medicine. Many advantages of human USCs have been found for cell-based therapy: (i) the cell isolation procedure is simple and low cost; (ii) they have remarkable proliferation ability, multidifferentiation potential, and paracrine effects; and (iii) they facilitate tissue regeneration in many animal models.

"Demonstrating target engagement in vivo is an important milestone in drug development, both to establish on target, on tissue interactions but also to identify potentially undesirable off tissue binding. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a long-studied yet vexing drug target that has recently re-emerged as a potential druggable driver of many solid tumor types including breast and prostate cancer, and several antagonists are currently in early phase clinical trials. Since GR is also ubiquitously expressed in normal tissues, understanding antagonist/GR interactions in normal tissues and tumor is crucial to defining a therapeutic index.

"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a severe type of primary liver cancer with high postoperative recurrence. The prognosis predictability of tumor-infiltrating leukocytes (TILs) for patients who underwent HCC resection has been widely reported. However, limited information is available about TIL trafficking, which is also crucial for HCC patients.We included tumor tissue samples and clinical data from 89 HCC patients in this study and performed immunohistochemistry for CD3, CD8, FoxP3, and CD31. TILs were measured using an algorithm for quantification of tumor immune stroma (QTiS). Intratumoral microvessels were counted using Weidner's method. We first examined correlations among them and analyzed their relationships with clinical and survival data.Intratumoral microvessel density (iMVD) was significantly correlated with infiltration of CD3+ (r = 0.338, P = .001) and CD8+ (r = 0.320, P = .002) cells, but not FoxP3+ (r = 0.153, P = .152) cells. After multivariate analysis, higher infiltration of CD3+ (P = .038) independently showed significant predictability on better overall survival after resection of HCC. Although no influence of CD3+ (P = .386) and CD8+ (P = .648) cells were found on general disease-free survival, infiltration of CD3+ (P = .012), tumor size (P = .032) and albumin (P = .007) cells independently predicted late-phase disease-free survival. No significant relationships regarding iMVD, and infiltration of FoxP3+ cells with overall and disease-free survival were found.Our data suggest that increased iMVD could enrich tumor-infiltrating CD3+ cells. Infiltrated CD3+ cells could help to better predict both the overall and late-phase disease-free survival after resection of HCC.","['increased imvd could enrich tumor', 'first examined correlations among', 'included tumor tissue samples', '012 ), tumor size', 'independently showed significant predictability', 'significant relationships regarding imvd', 'cells independently predicted late', 'tumor immune stroma', 'primary liver cancer', 'high postoperative recurrence', 'cells could help', 'intratumoral microvessel density', 'counted using weidner', '89 hcc patients', 'underwent hcc resection', 'better overall survival', 'prognosis predictability', 'measured using', 'intratumoral microvessels', 'better predict', 'survival data', 'free survival', 'free survival', 'free survival', 'free survival', 'widely reported', 'til trafficking', 'significantly correlated', 'severe type', 'qtis ).', 'performed immunohistochemistry', 'multivariate analysis', 'limited information', 'infiltrating leukocytes', 'hepatocellular carcinoma', 'data suggest', 'also crucial', 'hcc patients', 'phase disease', 'phase disease', 'general disease', 'clinical data', 'tumor', 'imvd', 'infiltrating cd3', 'infiltrated cd3', 'higher infiltration', 'relationships', 'late', 'patients', 'hcc', 'hcc', 'hcc', 'disease', 'cells', 'cells', 'cells', 'cells', 'cells', 'resection', 'resection', 'overall', 'overall', 'clinical', 'cd3', 'cd3', 'cd3', 'cd3', 'cd3', 'infiltration', 'infiltration', 'infiltration', 'tils', 'tils', 'study', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'quantification', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'method', 'influence', 'however', 'foxp3', 'foxp3', 'foxp3', 'found', 'found', 'cd8', 'cd8', 'cd8', 'cd31', 'available', 'analyzed', 'although', 'algorithm', 'albumin', '648', '386', '338', '320', '153', '152', '038', '032', '007', '002', '001', '0', '0', '0']"
"A high-cholesterol diet increases the risk of bladder cancer. The purpose of this nationwide longitudinal population-based retrospective cohort study is to investigate whether hyperlipidemia is a risk factor for bladder cancer.Data from Taiwan National Health Insurance Database were analyzed. The primary study end point was the occurrence of newly diagnosed bladder cancer. The relative risk of bladder cancer in a hyperlipidemia cohort was compared with that in an age- and gender-matched non-hyperlipidemia cohort by using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Cox regression analyses were further adjusted by the propensity score.Our data revealed that the hyperlipidemia cohort (n = 33,555) had a significantly higher subsequent risk of bladder cancer than did the non-hyperlipidemia cohort (n = 33,555) (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.37, P = .005) after propensity score adjustment. Subgroup analyses revealed that men in the hyperlipidemia cohort had a significantly higher subsequent risk of bladder cancer than did those in the non-hyperlipidemia cohort (adjusted HR = 1.36, P = .040). However, the risk of bladder cancer was not significantly different between women in the hyperlipidemia cohort and those in the non-hyperlipidemia cohort. Subgroup analyses further revealed that the risk of bladder cancer was significantly higher in men aged 20 to 39 years in the hyperlipidemia cohort than in those in the non-hyperlipidemia cohort (adjusted HR = 5.45, P = .029).In conclusion, hyperlipidemia is a risk factor for bladder cancer in young adult men.","['taiwan national health insurance database', 'cox proportional hazards regression model', 'primary study end point', 'based retrospective cohort study', 'significantly higher subsequent risk', 'significantly higher subsequent risk', 'newly diagnosed bladder cancer', 'cox regression analyses', 'nationwide longitudinal population', 'cholesterol diet increases', 'young adult men', 'men aged 20', 'propensity score adjustment', 'investigate whether hyperlipidemia', 'adjusted hazard ratio', 'subgroup analyses revealed', 'significantly higher', 'subgroup analyses', 'significantly different', 'propensity score', 'bladder cancer', 'bladder cancer', 'bladder cancer', 'bladder cancer', 'bladder cancer', 'bladder cancer', 'bladder cancer', 'bladder cancer', 'hyperlipidemia cohort', 'hyperlipidemia cohort', 'hyperlipidemia cohort', 'hyperlipidemia cohort', 'hyperlipidemia cohort', 'hyperlipidemia cohort', 'hyperlipidemia cohort', 'hyperlipidemia cohort', 'hyperlipidemia cohort', 'hyperlipidemia cohort', 'risk factor', 'risk factor', 'relative risk', '39 years', '040 ).', '029 ).', 'adjusted hr', 'adjusted hr', 'data revealed', 'matched non', 'men', 'risk', 'risk', 'risk', 'revealed', 'hyperlipidemia', 'adjusted', 'hr', 'data', 'non', 'non', 'non', 'non', 'women', 'using', 'purpose', 'p', 'p', 'p', 'occurrence', 'n', 'n', 'however', 'high', 'gender', 'conclusion', 'compared', 'analyzed', 'age', '555', '555', '5', '45', '37', '36', '33', '33', '1', '1', '005']"
"Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) means that the primary focus cannot be found after preliminary clinical evaluation. It accounts for 2.3% to 5% of newly diagnosed cancer cases. Due to the lack of standard treatment, CUP is usually associated with poor prognosis and is the third to fourth most common cause of cancer-related deaths.
We report the case of a 42-year-old female patient who was admitted to the hospital for intermittent right abdominal pain and abdominal distension. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a large abdominal mass of unknown origin, which was difficult to resect due to its close relationship with surrounding tissues. Twenty days later, the patient had enlarged left supraclavicular lymph nodes, and percutaneous biopsy revealed squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tissue and blood samples showed immune-related mutations and PD-L1 expression.
The patient was diagnosed with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary origin, with a bulky abdominal mass.
The patient was treated with carboplatin, albumin-binding paclitaxel, and immune checkpoint inhibitor (carilizumab). After 6 cycles, the patient was switched to maintenance treatment with carilizumab.
The general condition of the patient improved, and the lesion was significantly reduced. The treatment efficacy was assessed as partial remission according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. The patient benefited from immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy.
There is no recommended standard treatment for most CUPs, which leads to their poor prognoses. By performing NGS for patients and targeting immune-related positive predictors, immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy may prolong the overall survival of patients. This case report suggests that immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy is feasible and effective in patients with CUP.","['percutaneous biopsy revealed squamous cell carcinoma', 'enlarged left supraclavicular lymph nodes', 'metastatic squamous cell carcinoma', 'intermittent right abdominal pain', 'blood samples showed immune', 'newly diagnosed cancer cases', 'twenty days later', 'response evaluation criteria', 'preliminary clinical evaluation', 'partial remission according', 'large abdominal mass', 'immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'bulky abdominal mass', 'abdominal computed tomography', 'primary focus cannot', 'related positive predictors', 'recommended standard treatment', 'chemotherapy may prolong', 'old female patient', 'unknown primary origin', 'case report suggests', 'unknown primary', 'targeting immune', 'abdominal distension', 'unknown origin', 'standard treatment', 'related mutations', 'related deaths', 'treatment efficacy', 'maintenance treatment', 'usually associated', 'surrounding tissues', 'solid tumors', 'significantly reduced', 'poor prognosis', 'poor prognoses', 'overall survival', 'l1 expression', 'immunotherapy combined', 'immunotherapy combined', 'immunotherapy combined', 'generation sequencing', 'general condition', 'common cause', 'close relationship', 'binding paclitaxel', '6 cycles', 'patient improved', 'patient benefited', 'resect due', 'performing ngs', 'carilizumab ).', 'showed', 'diagnosed', 'report', 'case', 'cancer', 'cancer', 'chemotherapy', 'chemotherapy', 'patient', 'patient', 'patient', 'patient', 'ngs', 'due', 'carilizumab', 'year', 'treated', 'tissue', 'third', 'switched', 'pd', 'patients', 'patients', 'patients', 'next', 'means', 'lesion', 'leads', 'lack', 'hospital', 'fourth', 'found', 'feasible', 'effective', 'difficult', 'cups', 'cup', 'cup', 'cup', 'ct', 'carboplatin', 'assessed', 'albumin', 'admitted', 'addition', 'accounts', '5', '42', '3', '2']"
"The brain is an unusual site for distant metastases of thyroid cancer. The radiological features of brain metastases (BMs) have rarely been reported. Hemorrhage is frequently noted in BMs from thyroid cancer. This study aimed to investigate the clinico-radiological features of BMs from thyroid cancer and to determine the risk factors to predict BM hemorrhage.We retrospectively evaluated the MR images of 35 patients with BMs from thyroid cancer at our hospital from 2013 to 2020. The number, size, site, presence of extra-cranial metastasis, presence of perilesional edema, intra-tumoral hemorrhage, enhancement pattern, and presence of diffusion restriction on MRI were described. We further classified the thyroid cancers into hemorrhagic and nonhemorrhagic groups to investigate the factors associated with hemorrhage.54.29% of patients with thyroid BMs (19/35) had neurologic symptoms. 94.29% of patients (33/35) had extra-cranial metastases. The most common histology of primary thyroid cancer was papillary thyroid cancer (71.43%, 25/35), followed by anaplastic thyroid cancer (22.86%, 8/35). Thyroid cancer BMs were located mostly in the supra-tentorium (51.43%, 18/35) or both the supra and infra-tentorium (45.71%, 16/35). 60% of patients (21/35) showed hemorrhage within the BMs. The strongest predictor for BM hemorrhage was tumor size (variable importance: 50).Thyroid cancer BMs exhibit a bleeding tendency.

"Recent studies suggested that RNA binding proteins (RBPs) were related to the tumorigenesis and progression of glioma. This study was conducted to identify prognostic RBPs of glioblastoma (GBM) and construct an RBP signature to predict the prognosis of GBM.Univariate Cox regression analysis was carried out to identify the RBPs associated with overall survival of GBM in the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), GSE16011, and Repository for Molecular Brain Neoplasia data (Rembrandt) datasets, respectively. Overlapping RBPs from the TCGA, GSE16011, and Rembrandt datasets were selected. The biological role of prognostic RBPs was assessed by Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and protein-protein interaction analyses. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analysis and multivariate Cox regression analysis were used to construct an RBP-related risk signature. The prognostic value of RBP signature was measured by Kaplan-Meier method and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve. A nomogram based on independent prognostic factors was established to predict survival for GBM. The CGGA cohort was used as the validation cohort for external validation.This study identified 27 RBPs associated with the prognosis of GBM and constructed a 6-RPBs signature. Kaplan-Meier curves suggested that high-risk score was associated with a poor prognosis. Area under the curve of 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival was 0.618, 0.728, and 0.833 for TCGA cohort, 0.655, 0.909, and 0.911 for GSE16011 cohort, and 0.665, 0.792, and 0.781 for Rembrandt cohort, respectively. A nomogram with 4 parameters (age, chemotherapy, O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter status, and risk score) was constructed.

"The G protein-coupled receptor 116 (GPR116) is an adhesion subtype of the G protein-coupled receptor family and has been reported to be involved in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Moreover, it has been shown to predict poor prognosis in breast and colorectal cancers. However, little is known about the role of GPR116 in gastric cancer (GC). In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression and clinical prognostic significance of GPR116 in GC.The mRNA expression levels of GPR116 in GC were analyzed using Gene Expression Omnibus and UALCAN databases, and GPR116 protein expression in GC tissues was detected using immunohistochemistry. The relationship between GPR116 expression and prognosis in patients with GC was analyzed and further validated using the Kaplan-Meier Plotter database. The correlation between GPR116 and the differentially expressed genes identified was analyzed using the LinkedOmics database. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using WebGestalt. The results revealed that GPR116 expression was significantly upregulated in GC tissues, which was positively correlated with tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging and tumor invasion. Prognostic analysis suggested that high GPR116 expression contributed to poor overall survival in GC patients. Multivariate Cox analysis indicated that GPR116 overexpression was an independent prognostic indicator in patients with GC (HR = 1.855, 95% CI 1.021-3.370, P = .043). Enrichment analysis showed that GPR116 co-expression genes were mainly involved in extracellular matrix-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, cell adhesion, PI3K-Akt signaling, DNA replication, and cell cycle pathways.

"Despite the continuous advancement of liver cancer diagnosis technology and level, there are still nearly two-thirds of patients with primary liver cancer that are already advanced at the time of diagnosis. Ultrasound-guided microwave ablation, as a palliative treatment for intermediate and advanced liver cancer, is currently recognized internationally Standard treatment for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. However, recently, some scholars hold that ultrasound-guided microwave ablation does not guarantee complete inactivation of tumor lesions.
This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ultrasound-guided microwave ablation in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma through retrospective analysis. This study will follow a clinical research method with consecutive enrollment. The overall survival rate, objective tumor remission rate, serum indices and incidence of adverse effects after treatment will be counted for patients.
At present, there are no good treatment options for intermediate and advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, there is a strong demand to explore the individualized multidisciplinary combined treatment model based on ultrasound-guided microwave ablation.

"Liver cancer is a deadly disease with generally poor patient outcomes. BDH1 is a key enzyme that regulates the metabolism and synthesis of ketone bodies. This study sought to explore the prognostic relevance of BDH1 mRNA expression in liver cancer.We utilized the Cancer Genome Atlas datasets to analyze the relationship between BDH1 expression and clinical outcomes. We used Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox analyses to explore the relevance of BDH1 mRNA levels to patient prognosis. Further gene set enrichment analysis was conducted as a means of comparing differences in gene expression as a function of BDH1 expression.Liver cancer samples exhibited significantly decreased BDH1 mRNA expression, and that this downregulation was correlated with a number of clinicopathological variables including gender, histologic grade, stage, TNM classification, and both overall and relapse-free survival. We further determined that BDH1 mRNA expression was an independent predictor of liver cancer patient prognosis. A subsequent gene set enrichment analysis found genes affected by BDH1 expression to be those enriched in pathways relating to MYC and wnt/β-catenin signaling.Our preliminary findings demonstrate for the first time that low expression of BDH1 mRNA is a potentially valuable independent prognostic indicator for liver cancer detection.","['subsequent gene set enrichment analysis found genes affected', 'liver cancer samples exhibited significantly decreased bdh1 mrna expression', 'gene set enrichment analysis', 'potentially valuable independent prognostic indicator', 'clinicopathological variables including gender', 'cancer genome atlas datasets', 'liver cancer patient prognosis', 'generally poor patient outcomes', 'liver cancer detection', 'bdh1 mrna expression', 'bdh1 mrna expression', 'bdh1 mrna levels', 'preliminary findings demonstrate', 'liver cancer', 'liver cancer', 'gene expression', 'bdh1 mrna', 'patient prognosis', 'bdh1 expression', 'bdh1 expression', 'bdh1 expression', 'independent predictor', 'low expression', 'prognostic relevance', 'clinical outcomes', 'used kaplan', 'tnm classification', 'study sought', 'pathways relating', 'meier curves', 'key enzyme', 'ketone bodies', 'histologic grade', 'free survival', 'first time', 'deadly disease', 'cox analyses', 'comparing differences', 'catenin signaling', 'bdh1', 'relevance', 'β', 'wnt', 'utilized', 'synthesis', 'stage', 'relationship', 'relapse', 'regulates', 'overall', 'number', 'myc', 'metabolism', 'means', 'function', 'explore', 'explore', 'enriched', 'downregulation', 'determined', 'correlated', 'conducted', 'analyze']"
"Hartmann procedure (HP) often causes severe postoperative adhesions in the pelvic space; therefore, the reversal of Hartmann procedure (RHP) is a challenging surgery. A new spray-type antiadhesion agent, AdSpray, has been reported to be useful in three-dimensional fields such as the liver. However, there are no reports of its use in HP. We present a case of a male patient with rectal cancer who underwent laparoscopic HP with AdSpray to prevent postoperative adhesions.
A 52-year-old man presented with melena and constipation.
Colonoscopy revealed an almost obstructive type II tumor at the rectosigmoid colon, and histopathological examination revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Enhanced abdominal computed tomography revealed slightly enlarged regional lymph nodes but no ascites around the tumor, and there was no metastasis to the liver or lungs. Therefore, we diagnosed clinical stage T4aN1bM0 rectosigmoid colon cancer. Intraoperatively, a metastatic tumor of the liver surface and a high degree of valve retention in the oral colon were identified.
After performing laparoscopic HP with AdSpray, we scheduled a laparoscopic RHP with staged hepatic surgery for synchronous liver metastasis from colorectal cancer 1 month later.
No postoperative inflammatory adhesions were observed in the pelvis or around the rectal stump, allowing us to perform RHP by a single-incision laparoscopic surgery from the stoma site without any problem. The operation time for RHP was 80 minutes; the patient was in good general condition after the operation, and he was discharged on postoperative day 7.
In laparoscopic HP, Adspray was easy to use for three-dimensional fields such as the pelvis and effectively prevented postoperative inflammatory adhesions. Thus, RHP may become less risky and be performed more as a minimally invasive surgery.","['enhanced abdominal computed tomography revealed slightly enlarged regional lymph nodes', 'diagnosed clinical stage t4an1bm0 rectosigmoid colon cancer', 'histopathological examination revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma', 'colorectal cancer 1 month later', 'often causes severe postoperative adhesions', 'rhp may become less risky', 'effectively prevented postoperative inflammatory adhesions', 'almost obstructive type ii tumor', 'postoperative inflammatory adhesions', 'prevent postoperative adhesions', 'type antiadhesion agent', 'postoperative day 7', 'stoma site without', 'old man presented', 'good general condition', 'staged hepatic surgery', 'minimally invasive surgery', 'incision laparoscopic surgery', 'rectosigmoid colon', 'colonoscopy revealed', 'underwent laparoscopic hp', 'performing laparoscopic hp', 'synchronous liver metastasis', 'rectal cancer', 'oral colon', 'laparoscopic rhp', 'challenging surgery', 'metastatic tumor', 'laparoscopic hp', 'perform rhp', 'valve retention', 'rectal stump', 'pelvic space', 'new spray', 'high degree', 'hartmann procedure', 'hartmann procedure', 'dimensional fields', 'dimensional fields', 'allowing us', '80 minutes', 'liver surface', 'operation time', 'male patient', 'ascites around', 'tumor', 'rhp', 'rhp', 'metastasis', 'hp', 'hp', 'liver', 'liver', 'patient', 'operation', 'around', 'year', 'useful', 'use', 'use', 'thus', 'three', 'three', 'therefore', 'therefore', 'single', 'scheduled', 'reversal', 'reports', 'reported', 'problem', 'present', 'performed', 'pelvis', 'pelvis', 'observed', 'melena', 'lungs', 'intraoperatively', 'identified', 'however', 'easy', 'discharged', 'constipation', 'case', 'adspray', 'adspray', 'adspray', 'adspray', '52']"
"Angiosarcoma secondary to post-irradiation and lymphedema is rare, but it is aggressive with a poor prognosis. It is essential to understand these patients' clinical features and distinguish them from benign diseases or other malignant tumors.
Three patients who had radiotherapy for cancer treatment and chronic lymphedema admitted to the hospital with specific skin lesions at upper or lower extremities.
Excisional biopsies revealed prominent, highly atypical cells with a vasoformative area, composed of atypical, large epithelioid cells with vesicular nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and mitoses. Immunohistochemistry revealed diffuse expression of endothelial cell markers suggestive of angiosarcoma.
One patient had shoulder disarticulation with wide excision with adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy and other 2 discontinued the treatment.
After the treatment, one patient was transferred to rehabilitation department for shoulder disarticulation prosthesis fitting without recurrence sign for 1 year. Two patient refused further treatment and was lost to follow-up.

"Endometrial cancer (EC) is the second most common malignancy of the female reproductive system worldwide, and the standard treatment for early-stage EC potentially leads to permanent infertility. The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacies of different methods on fertility preservation in patients with early-stage EC.
We searched the major online databases (PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) to collect the research literature on fertility preservation therapy in patients with early-stage well-differentiated EC aged ≤ 40 years from January 1999 to October 2019. The inclusion was performed using the R software (version R3.5.3) meta-analysis of a single rate. The efficacy of the following three fertility preservation treatments was evaluated from four aspects, the complete remission rate (CRR), recurrence rate (ReR), pregnancy rate (PregR), and live birth rate (LBR): a) taking oral progestin only therapy, b) hysteroscopic resection combined with progestin/levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS)/GnRH-a, c) LNG-IUS or combined with progestin/GnRH-a.
A total of 23 articles were included in this study, including 446 patients with early-stage EC. In the group that took oral progestin only (n = 279), CRR, ReR, PregR, and LBR were 82% (95% confidence interval [CI], 74%-92%, P = .01), 38% (95% CI, 31%-45%, P = .35), 70% (95% CI, 62%-79%, P = .68), and 63% (95% CI, 55%-73%, P = .55), respectively. Hysteroscopic resection combined with progestin/LNG-IUS/GnRH-a therapy group (n = 96) achieved a CRR, ReR, PregR, and LBR of 95% (95% CI, 90%-100%, P = .42), 16% (95% CI, 6%-39%, P = .03), 84% (95% CI, 73%-96%, P = .39), and 72% (95% CI, 59%-87%, P = .28), respectively. LNG-IUS or combined with progestin/GnRH-a therapy group (n = 91) achieved a CRR, ReR, PregR, and LBR of 69% (95% CI, 54%-89%, P < .01), 30% (95% CI, 19%-49%, P = .36), 48% (95% CI, 18%-100%, P < .01), and 36% (95% CI, 10%-100%, P < .01), respectively.
It is safe and effective for young patients with early-stage EC to receive oral progestin, hysteroscopic resection combined with progestin/LNG-IUS/GnRH-a, LNG-IUS, or progestin/GnRH-a.

"Prediabetes is an intermediate metabolic state between normoglycemia and diabetes. Without intervention, prediabetes often progresses to diabetes and prediabetes is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, renal disease, and dementia. Lifestyle modification play a major role in controlling prediabetes. But lifestyle interventions are often with poor compliance and side effects of drugs are often be dislike by people. As a non-invasive therapy with no side effects, abdominal massage (AM), also called viscera massage in China, has been used to treat prediabetes and obesity-associated diseases. The gut microbiota has been recognized as an important factor in the development of metabolic diseases. Individuals with prediabetes have aberrant intestinal microbiota character. Colonic transport time and stool consistency are strongly associated with gut microbiota. Viscera massage can ease constipation by reducing colonic transport time and promoting intestinal motility. We can infer that viscera massage can modulate composition of gut microbiota affects human metabolism. So, in this trial, we will explore the mechanism of viscera massage on prediabetes from the perspective of intestinal microbiota.
Eighty prediabetes individuals will be recruited for this study. Eighty prediabetes individuals will be divided into lifestyle intervention group and viscera massage + lifestyle intervention group by a simple random method. Each group will have 40 individuals. The manipulation of the viscera massage + lifestyle intervention group will be mainly carried out through rubbing the abdomen, kneading abdomen, vibrating abdomen, and pressing the abdomen, 30 minutes per time, once a day, with 2 days off every 5 days. Lifestyle interventions will be performed by combining pushing healthy lifestyle guidance information through Wechat application and giving face-to-face advice together daily. The lifestyle intervention group will receive healthy lifestyle intervention only. All the intervention will be conducted for 4 weeks. Weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, and waist-to-height ratio will be measured at the last day of every week. Triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting blood-glucose, 2-hour post-meal blood glucose (2hPG) and glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting insulin and insulin resistance index will be tested at the first day and last day of the intervention course. The fecal samples of subjects will be gathered at the first day and last day of the intervention course and will be performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic detection. Finally, the effect and potential mechanism of viscera massage on prediabetes will be discussed in combination with all the results.
The results of this study will be used to verify the effect of AM on prediabetes and explore the mechanism of AM on prediabetes from the perspective of gut microbiota.","['combining pushing healthy lifestyle guidance information', 'performed 16s rrna gene sequencing', 'gut microbiota affects human metabolism', '), also called viscera massage', '30 minutes per time', 'face advice together daily', 'receive healthy lifestyle intervention', 'reducing colonic transport time', 'bmi ), waist circumference', 'aberrant intestinal microbiota character', 'colonic transport time', 'lifestyle modification play', 'simple random method', 'promoting intestinal motility', 'body mass index', 'density lipoprotein cholesterol', 'density lipoprotein cholesterol', 'intermediate metabolic state', 'insulin resistance index', 'lifestyle intervention group', 'lifestyle intervention group', 'lifestyle intervention group', 'lifestyle intervention group', 'every 5 days', 'meal blood glucose', 'eighty prediabetes individuals', 'eighty prediabetes individuals', 'prediabetes often progresses', 'intestinal microbiota', 'gut microbiota', 'gut microbiota', 'gut microbiota', 'lifestyle interventions', 'lifestyle interventions', 'giving face', 'viscera massage', 'viscera massage', 'viscera massage', 'viscera massage', 'viscera massage', 'viscera massage', 'total cholesterol', 'without intervention', 'intervention course', 'intervention course', 'metabolic diseases', 'fasting insulin', 'fasting blood', 'every week', 'abdominal massage', '40 individuals', 'wechat application', 'stool consistency', 'side effects', 'side effects', 'renal disease', 'poor compliance', 'modulate composition', 'metagenomic detection', 'major role', 'mainly carried', 'invasive therapy', 'increased risk', 'important factor', 'hour post', 'hip ratio', 'height ratio', 'glycosylated hemoglobin', 'fecal samples', 'ease constipation', 'cardiovascular disease', '4 weeks', '2 days', 'last day', 'last day', 'last day', 'first day', 'first day', 'treat prediabetes', 'strongly associated', 'controlling prediabetes', 'associated diseases', 'vibrating abdomen', 'kneading abdomen', 'potential mechanism', 'performed', 'group', 'intervention', 'individuals', 'waist', 'waist', 'glucose', 'day', 'prediabetes', 'prediabetes', 'prediabetes', 'prediabetes', 'prediabetes', 'prediabetes', 'prediabetes', 'often', 'often', 'associated', 'abdomen', 'abdomen', '2', 'mechanism', 'mechanism', 'weight', 'verify', 'used', 'used', 'triglycerides', 'trial', 'tested', 'subjects', 'study', 'study', 'rubbing', 'results', 'results', 'recruited', 'recognized', 'pressing', 'perspective', 'perspective', 'people', 'obesity', 'normoglycemia', 'non', 'measured', 'manipulation', 'low', 'infer', 'high', 'gathered', 'finally', 'explore', 'explore', 'effect', 'effect', 'drugs', 'divided', 'dislike', 'discussed', 'diabetes', 'diabetes', 'development', 'dementia', 'conducted', 'combination', 'china', 'cancer', '2hpg']"

"Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is a technically demanding procedure with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Therefore, preoperative evaluation of anatomy is indispensable. Multi-detector row computed tomography (CT) enables us to precisely understand arterial anatomy. It is a well-known fact that anatomical variants are often present in the hepatic artery (HA) but rarely in the gastroduodenal artery (GDA). We present the case of a patient with ampullary cancer with a rare anatomical anomaly, ""replaced GDA (rGDA) "" arising from the superior mesenteric artery, along with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) using right gastroepiploic artery (RGEA).
A 69-year-old male patient was referred to our department for further investigation of elevated hepatobiliary enzymes. He presented with no symptoms besides intermittent fever of 38°C. He had an operative history of CABG using the RGEA.
Abdominal CT and esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed an ampullary tumor and biopsy specimen from the lesion revealed adenocarcinoma. CT angiography revealed the rGDA instead of a normal common HA.
We performed a safe PD, preserving the rGDA and the RGEA to maintain hepatic and cardiac perfusion.
Owing to the presence of a refractory pancreatic fistula, the length-of-hospital stay was extended, and he was discharged on postoperative day 72 without vascular complications. At present, the patient is in good physical condition and does not present with cardiovascular complications as well as tumor recurrence at 6 months after surgery.
This is possibly the first case of a patient who underwent PD and has a proper HA following a GDA arising from a superior mesenteric artery (rGDA) and has a previous operative history of CABG using the gastroepiploic artery. The coexistence of the history of cardiovascular surgery made PD for this patient considerably more challenging.In the case of a rare anatomical anomaly, a coronary artery bypass via the RGEA should not be considered as an obstacle when R0 resection is achievable.","['postoperative day 72 without vascular complications', 'symptoms besides intermittent fever', 'detector row computed tomography', 'coronary artery bypass via', 'coronary artery bypass grafting', 'precisely understand arterial anatomy', 'using right gastroepiploic artery', 'cardiovascular surgery made pd', 'technically demanding procedure', 'superior mesenteric artery', 'superior mesenteric artery', 'refractory pancreatic fistula', 'lesion revealed adenocarcinoma', 'good physical condition', 'elevated hepatobiliary enzymes', '38 ° c', 'rare anatomical anomaly', 'rare anatomical anomaly', 'proper ha following', 'normal common ha', 'ct angiography revealed', 'old male patient', 'previous operative history', 'cardiovascular complications', 'gastroepiploic artery', 'hepatic artery', 'gastroduodenal artery', 'anatomical variants', 'cabg using', 'cabg using', 'underwent pd', 'safe pd', 'operative history', 'tumor recurrence', 'replaced gda', 'r0 resection', 'preoperative evaluation', 'maintain hepatic', 'known fact', 'hospital stay', 'high rates', 'gda ).', 'esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed', 'enables us', 'cardiac perfusion', 'biopsy specimen', 'ampullary tumor', 'ampullary cancer', 'abdominal ct', '6 months', 'patient considerably', 'gda arising', 'first case', 'rgea ).', 'rgda instead', 'often present', 'surgery', 'anatomy', 'ha', 'pd', 'ct', 'history', 'history', 'cabg', 'patient', 'patient', 'patient', 'arising', 'case', 'case', 'rgea', 'rgea', 'rgea', 'rgda', 'rgda', 'rgda', 'present', 'present', 'present', 'year', 'well', 'well', 'therefore', 'referred', 'rarely', 'preserving', 'presented', 'presence', 'possibly', 'performed', 'pancreaticoduodenectomy', 'owing', 'obstacle', 'multi', 'mortality', 'morbidity', 'length', 'investigation', 'indispensable', 'extended', 'discharged', 'department', 'considered', 'coexistence', 'challenging', 'along', 'achievable', '69']"
"Genetic polymorphisms of plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 can affect various tumors including gastro-intestinal, sexual hormone sensitive cancers and lymphoma. Accumulated evidence have shown that plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 acts as an oncogene and tumor suppressor in various cancers. In fact, the rs13255292 and rs2608053 single nucleotide polymorphisms of plasmacytoma variant translocation 1are known to affect lymphoma; however, their effects on gastric cancer are primarily unknown. In this study, we evaluated the association between these plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 polymorphisms and the risk of gastric cancer.In the present study, 462 patients diagnosed with gastric cancer and 377 cancer-free controls were enrolled. The TaqMan genotyping assay was used to analyze the association between rs13255292 and rs2608053 single nucleotide polymorphisms and the risk of gastric cancer.The rs2608053 dominant model (CT + TT) was associated with a decreased risk of gastric cancer in T3 + T4 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.61, confidence interval (CI) = 0.41 - 0.92, P = .019), and stage III Gastric cancer subgroups (OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.38 - 0.91, P = .017) compared to the CC genotype. When stratified analysis by sex was carried out, the rs13255292 dominant model (CT + TT) had a significant association with an increased risk of gastric cancer in the female negative lymph node metastasis gastric cancer subgroup, compared to the CC genotype (OR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.16 - 3.30, P = .012).

"Following the reduction in levels of exposure to benzene over the last few decades, the cancer risk of refuelers currently represents an occupational hygiene issue potentially underestimated by employers and workers themselves. Based on the literature data, the occurrence of adverse effects of neoplastic nature can not actually be excluded in this professional category, since it is not possible to define a threshold dose. In the period 2016 - 2019, an extensive focused campaign of labour inspections was conducted in the province of Bari by the OSH inspection services of the Health Local Authority in order to verify the compliance with the legislation on the workers' protection from carcinogenic agents at fuel stations. In particular, the obligations referring risk assessment, workplace hygiene, environmental monitoring, personal protective equipment (PPE), health surveillance, biological monitoring and recording of exposure to carcinogens were verified. Although these obligations were documentarily fulfilled by almost all the 162 plants inspected in the province of Bari, several critical issues were found in the approach to carcinogenic risk, including, more frequently, the lack of suitable changing rooms with relative lockers for clothing, the scarce use of gloves when dispensing fuel, the absence or incompleteness of the carcinogenic risk assessment documents, the failed or incorrect execution of biological monitoring. Data of the environmental monitoring carried out by the companies confirm that the current exposures to benzene of fuel distributors are considerably below the limit values set by the Italian legislation. The most frequently used biological exposure indicator was trans, trans-muconic urinary acid (TTMA-U). In order to reduce as much as possible the health risks for refuelers, it is needed that employers, workers and occupational physicians pay more attention to their respective duties, ensuring corrective or ameliorative interventions focused on assessment of the risk of carcinogens, supply and use of PPE, design of workplaces, health surveillance and biological monitoring of workers. The poor value of the end-of-shift TTMA-U as a biological indicator of exposure to low-dose benzene is also confirmed.
A seguito della riduzione dei livelli di esposizione a benzene nel corso degli ultimi decenni, il rischio cancerogeno degli addetti al rifornimento di carburante rappresenta oggi un problema di igiene del lavoro potenzialmente sottovalutato dai datori di lavoro e dagli stessi lavoratori. I dati di letteratura non consentono peraltro di escludere la possibilità di effetti avversi di natura neoplastica in tale categoria professionale, non essendo possibile definire una dose soglia. Nel periodo 2016 - 2019, sul territorio della provincia di Bari, è stato condotto da parte dei competenti Organi di Vigilanza un esteso piano mirato di vigilanza atto a verificare il rispetto della normativa in materia di protezione dei lavoratori da agenti cancerogeni presso gli impianti di distribuzione carburante per autotrazione. Sono stati verificati in particolare gli obblighi in materia di valutazione dei rischi, igiene dei luoghi di lavoro, monitoraggio ambientale, dispositivi di protezione individuali (DPI), sorveglianza sanitaria, monitoraggio biologico, registri di esposizione ad agenti cancerogeni. Sebbene tali obblighi siano risultati assolti dal punto di vista documentale dalla quasi totalità dei 162 impianti ispezionati nella provincia di Bari, diverse criticità sono state riscontrate nell’approccio al rischio cancerogeno, tra le quali, con maggiore frequenza,la mancanza di idonei locali ad uso spogliatoio con relativi armadietti per gli indumenti, lo scarso impiego di guanti in fase di erogazione carburante, la assenza o incompletezza dei documenti di valutazione del rischio cancerogeno, la mancata o errata esecuzione del monitoraggio biologico. Gli esiti dei monitoraggi ambientali effettuati dalle aziende confermano che le attuali esposizioni a benzene degli addetti alla distribuzione di carburante sono notevolmente al di sotto dei valori limite fissati dalla normativa italiana. L’indicatore biologico di esposizione più frequentemente utilizzato è risultato l’acido trans, trans-muconico urinario (TTMA-U). Al fine di contribuire a ridurre il più possibile i rischi per la salute per gli addetti al rifornimento di carburante, è necessaria da parte dei datori di lavoro, dei lavoratori e dei Medici competenti una maggiore attenzione ai rispettivi obblighi, con interventi correttivi o migliorativi mirati alle attività di valutazione del rischio da agenti cancerogeni, fornitura ed utilizzo dei DPI, progettazione dei luoghi di lavoro, sorveglianza sanitaria e monitoraggio biologico. Si conferma inoltre lo scarso valore del TTMA-U di fine turno quale indicatore biologico di esposizione a benzene in caso di bassi livelli espositivi.","['il rischio cancerogeno degli addetti al

"The current study set out to clarify the role of miR-424-5p promoter methylation in epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. The findings of quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction and methylation-sensitive high-resolution melting assays elicited that miR-424-5p was poorly expressed in HCC tissues and cells while highly methylated. Meanwhile, upon demethylation, miR-424-5p expression levels were partly recovered in HCC cells. In addition, miR-424-5p upregulation reduced cell viability and elevated apoptosis of HCC cells, in parallel with increased N-cadherin and decreased E-cadherin levels. Dual-luciferase reporter assay further validated that miR-424-5p bound to the kinesin family member 2A (KIF2A), and miR-424-5p overexpression downregulated KIF2A. In addition, KIF2A overexpression reversed the miR-424-5p-driven changes in terms of cell viability, apoptosis and EMT-related protein levels. Furthermore, xenograft tumors were established via injection of Huh7 cells, followed by miR-424-5p overexpression in vivo, which inhabited KIF2A downregulation and attenuated tumor growth along with decreased Ki67 positive expression, diminished N-cadherin and elevated E-cadherin levels. Overall, our findings supported the conclusion that miR-424-5p promoter methylation reduced miR-424-5p expression and upregulated KIF2A, thereby promoting HCC EMT.","['5p upregulation reduced cell viability', '5p promoter methylation reduced mir', 'resolution melting assays elicited', 'kinesin family member 2a', 'attenuated tumor growth along', 'decreased ki67 positive expression', '5p overexpression downregulated kif2a', 'thereby promoting hcc emt', '5p promoter methylation', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'luciferase reporter assay', 'established via injection', 'epithelial mesenchymal transition', 'current study set', 'kif2a overexpression reversed', 'inhabited kif2a downregulation', 'related protein levels', '5p expression levels', 'cell viability', '5p overexpression', '5p expression', 'decreased e', 'upregulated kif2a', 'kif2a ),', '5p bound', 'hcc tissues', 'xenograft tumors', 'upon demethylation', 'sensitive high', 'quantitative real', 'poorly expressed', 'partly recovered', 'increased n', 'highly methylated', 'hepatocellular carcinoma', 'elevated e', 'driven changes', 'diminished n', 'cadherin levels', 'cadherin levels', 'hcc cells', 'hcc cells', 'huh7 cells', 'findings supported', 'elevated apoptosis', 'methylation', '5p', '5p', 'hcc', 'emt', 'emt', 'cells', 'cells', 'findings', 'cadherin', 'cadherin', 'apoptosis', 'mir', 'mir', 'mir', 'mir', 'mir', 'mir', 'mir', 'mir', 'mir', 'vivo', 'validated', 'time', 'terms', 'role', 'parallel', 'overall', 'meanwhile', 'furthermore', 'followed', 'dual', 'conclusion', 'clarify', 'addition', 'addition', '424', '424', '424', '424', '424', '424', '424', '424', '424', '424']"
"To compare the intrafractional motion error (IME) during stereotactic irradiation (STI) in patients with brain metastases immobilized using open- (Encompass) and full-face (DSPS) clamshell-style immobilization devices.
Encompass (38 patients) and DSPS (38 patients) were used for patient immobilization, and HyperArc plans with three to four non-coplanar beams were generated to deliver 25 to 35 Gy in three to five fractions. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) was performed on patients before and after the treatment. Moreover, the difference in patient position between the two CBCT images was considered as the IME. The margins to compensate for IME were calculated using the van Herk margin formula.
For Encompass, the mean values of IME in the translational setup were 0.1, 0.2, and 0.0 mm in the anterior-posterior, superior-inferior, and left-right directions, respectively, and the mean values of IME about rotational axes were -0.1, 0.0, and 0.0° for the Pitch, Roll, and Yaw rotations, respectively. For DSPS, the mean values of IME in the translational setup were 0.2, 0.2, and 0.0 mm in the anterior-posterior, superior-inferior, and left-right directions, respectively, and the mean values of IME about rotational axes were -0.1, -0.1, and 0.0° for the Pitch, Roll, and Yaw rotations, respectively. No statistically significant difference was observed between the IME of the two immobilization systems except in the anterior-posterior direction (p = 0.02). Moreover, no statistically significant correlation was observed between three-dimensional IME and treatment time. The margin compensation for IME was less than 1 mm for both immobilization devices.
The IME during STI using open- and full-face clamshell-style immobilization devices is approximately equal considering the adequate accuracy in patient positioning.","['brain metastases immobilized using open', 'van herk margin formula', 'two immobilization systems except', 'sti using open', 'statistically significant correlation', 'intrafractional motion error', 'beam computed tomography', 'approximately equal considering', 'two cbct images', 'style immobilization devices', 'style immobilization devices', 'statistically significant difference', 'immobilization devices', 'calculated using', 'margin compensation', 'patient immobilization', 'yaw rotations', 'yaw rotations', 'translational setup', 'translational setup', 'stereotactic irradiation', 'rotational axes', 'rotational axes', 'right directions', 'right directions', 'patient positioning', 'patient position', 'mean values', 'mean values', 'mean values', 'mean values', 'hyperarc plans', 'four non', 'five fractions', 'deliver 25', 'coplanar beams', 'adequate accuracy', '35 gy', '02 ).', 'treatment time', '38 patients', '38 patients', 'posterior direction', '0 °', '0 °', '0 mm', '0 mm', '1 mm', 'dimensional ime', 'face clamshell', 'sti', 'difference', 'cbct', 'treatment', 'patients', 'patients', 'face', 'clamshell', 'posterior', 'posterior', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '1', '1', '1', '1', 'ime', 'ime', 'ime', 'ime', 'ime', 'ime', 'ime', 'ime', 'ime', 'ime', 'used', 'three', 'three', 'three', 'superior', 'superior', 'roll', 'roll', 'respectively', 'respectively', 'respectively', 'respectively', 'pitch', 'pitch', 'performed', 'p', 'observed', 'observed', 'moreover', 'moreover', 'margins', 'less', 'left', 'left', 'inferior', 'inferior', 'generated', 'full', 'full', 'encompass', 'encompass', 'encompass', 'dsps', 'dsps', 'dsps', 'considered', 'cone', 'compensate', 'compare', 'anterior', 'anterior', 'anterior', '2', '2', '2']"
"The aim of this work was twofold. (1) To investigate and present a comparison between EBT3 and EBT-XD in terms of postirradiation color changes. (2) Create an automated workflow to allow radiochromic film (EBT3/XD) to be scanned and converted to dose accurately at any postirradiation time.
Ten GafChromic EBT-XD calibration films were exposed in 2 Gy increments up to 18 Gy. Calibrates were then scanned at 5-min intervals postirradiation over 24 h using an AutoHotKey script, resulting in 288 TIFF images. Following the 24-h scanning period, a MATLAB script was used to automatically read the tiff images and create a series of 288 calibration curves distinct in time which is termed as the ""Temporal Calibration Model"" (TCM). The model is saved as a series of polynomial fit coefficients to net optical density as a function of dose, timestamped in 5-min increments. Ten patient-specific film measurements (5 × EBT-XD and 5 × EBT3) were then carried out and scanned using the same 5-min scan intervals from 5 min postirradiation to 24 h postirradiation. The TCM was then automatically applied using eFilmQA software to convert the patient-specific QA films to dose by applying the relevant calibration curve from the TCM, corresponding to the arbitrary postirradiation time that the film was scanned. Each dose plane at postirradiation scan intervals of 5 min up to 20 h was then compared to the ground-truth dose plane using gamma analysis.
Gamma pass rates using the TCM at time t, normalized to the pass rate after 20 h postirradiation, were found to have a maximum coefficient of variation of 3% over any postirradiation time. Conversely, not using the TCM resulted in coefficients of variation of up to 39%. Clinical implementation of this method showed an average accuracy of 2.8% when comparing the clinical result to the TCM result.
We have developed a methodology that allows radiochromic film to be accurately used as a dosimeter at any arbitrary scan postirradiation time, whereas previously, waiting periods of 16-24 h before readout were needed to ensure the postirradiation changes had stabilized. The creation of a TCM can enable results from radiochromic film measurements to be obtained quickly postirradiation. Using a conventional single calibration curve generated at 20 h postirradiation can result in gamma pass-rate difference of up to 75% for measurement films scanned at a much shorter postirradiation time.","['truth dose plane using gamma analysis', 'conventional single calibration curve generated', 'automatically applied using efilmqa software', '288 calibration curves distinct', 'gamma pass rates using', 'much shorter postirradiation time', 'arbitrary scan postirradiation time', 'relevant calibration curve', 'postirradiation scan intervals', 'specific qa films', 'net optical density', 'min scan intervals', 'obtained quickly postirradiation', 'arbitrary postirradiation time', 'h scanning period', 'temporal calibration model', 'specific film measurements', 'radiochromic film measurements', 'allows radiochromic film', 'allow radiochromic film', 'min intervals postirradiation', '288 tiff images', 'postirradiation color changes', '20 h postirradiation', '20 h postirradiation', '24 h using', 'xd calibration films', 'polynomial fit coefficients', '24 h postirradiation', 'ten gafchromic ebt', 'measurement films scanned', '5 min postirradiation', '5 × ebt', '5 × ebt3', '2 gy increments', 'gamma pass', 'dose plane', 'automatically read', 'postirradiation changes', '20 h', 'postirradiation time', 'postirradiation time', 'min increments', 'tiff images', '24 h', 'scanned using', 'pass rate', '5 min', '18 gy', 'dose accurately', 'whereas previously', 'waiting periods', 'ten patient', 'rate difference', 'method showed', 'maximum coefficient', 'matlab script', 'enable results', 'clinical implementation', 'average accuracy', 'automated workflow', 'autohotkey script', '39 %.', 'clinical result', 'accurately used', 'tcm resulted', 'tcm ).', 'using', 'using', 'tcm result', 'film', 'time', 'time', 'dose', 'dose', 'ebt', '24', 'model', 'coefficients', '5', '5', '5', 'result', 'ebt3', 'ebt3', '2', '2', 'scanned', 'scanned', 'scanned', 'xd', 'xd', 'xd', 'used', 'patient', 'tcm', 'tcm', 'tcm', 'tcm', 'work', 'variation', 'variation', 'twofold', 'timestamped', 'terms', 'termed', 'stabilized', 'series', 'series', 'saved', 'resulting', 'readout', 'present', 'normalized', 'needed', 'methodology', 'investigate', 'ground', 'function', 'found', 'following', 'exposed', 'ensure', 'dosimeter', 'developed', 'creation', 'create', 'create', 'corresponding', 'converted', 'convert', 'conversely', 'comparison', 'comparing', 'compared', 'carried', 'calibrates', 'applying', 'aim', '8', '75', '3', '16', '1']"
"We share our experiences on uniformly implementing an effective and efficient SGRT procedure with a new clinical workflow for treating breast patients in deep-inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) among 9 clinical centers using 26 optical surface imaging (OSI) systems.
Our procedures have five major components: (1) acquiring both free-breathing (FB) and DIBH computed tomography (CT) at simulation to quantify the rise of the anterior surface, (2) defining uniformly a large region of interest (ROI) to accommodate large variations in patient anatomy and treatment techniques, (3) performing two-step setup in FB by first aligning the arm and chin to minimize breast deformation and reproduce local lymphnode positions and then aligning the ROI, (4) aligning the vertical shift precisely from FB to DIBH, and (5) capturing a new on-site reference image at DIBH to separate residual setup errors from the DIBH motion monitoring uncertainties. Moreover, a new clinical workflow was developed for patient data preparation using 4 OSI offline workstations without interruption of SGRT treatment at 22 OSI online workstations. This procedure/workflow is suitable for all photon planning techniques, including 2-field, 3-field, 4-field, partial breast irradiation (PBI), and volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) with or without bolus.
Since 2019, we have developed and applied the uniform breast SGRT DIBH procedure with optimized clinical workflow and ensured treatment accuracy among the nine clinics within our institution. About 150 breast DIBH patients are treated daily and two major upgrades are achieved smoothly throughout our institution, owing to the uniform and versatile procedure, adequate staff training, and efficient workflow with effective clinical supports and backup strategies.

"Cancer care trajectories are often complex, with potent multimodality treatments and multiple interactions with health care providers. Communication and coordination are challenging and the patients' responsibilities to take on more active roles in their own care are increasing.
This study aimed to investigate associations between patient activation level and participation in cancer care, sociodemographic characteristics, clinical data, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and helpfulness of received information.
In this cross-sectional population-based study, patients completed questionnaires on patient activation, perceived participation, HRQoL, helpfulness of received information and sociodemographic characteristics. Responses to the patient activation measures (PAMs) were classified into four levels (higher levels indicating more activation). Data on age, sex and cancer diagnosis were collected from the Swedish Cancer Register.
Data from 682 patients were analysed. On comparing patients at PAM levels 1 and 4, the latter reported significantly higher possibilities to influence care decisions (46.6% vs. 20.8%) and to ask questions regarding treatment and care (93.4% vs. 68.4%). Patients at PAM level 4 reported wanting to influence decision-making to a higher extent, compared with patients at other PAM levels, and reported clinically significantly higher HRQoL. No significant differences were found regarding sociodemographic characteristics.
We found strong associations between perceived patient participation and activation levels, with limited possibility for participation among those with lower activation levels.
Discussions with patient representatives have raised the importance of participation.

Plk family members participate in pivotal cell division processes as well as in non-mitotic roles. Importantly, Plk expression has been correlated with various disease states, including cancer. Multiples therapies, which primarily target Plk1, are currently being investigated alone or in combination with other agents for clinical use in different cancers. As the role of Plks in disease progression becomes more prominent, it is important to outline their functions as cell cycle regulators and more. This review summarizes the structure and both mitotic and non-mitotic functions of each of the five Plk family members, sequentially. Additionally, the proposed mechanisms for how Plks contribute to tumorigenesis and the therapeutics currently under investigation are outlined.","['pivotal cell division processes', 'plk family members participate', 'five plk family members', 'five different members', 'cell cycle regulators', 'various disease states', 'disease progression becomes', 'primarily target plk1', 'plk expression', 'different cancers', 'review summarizes', 'proposed mechanisms', 'multiples therapies', 'like kinase', 'investigated alone', 'including cancer', 'clinical use', '5 ),', 'mitotic roles', 'distinct functions', 'therapeutics currently', 'plks contribute', 'mitotic functions', 'family', 'plk', 'plk1', 'mitotic', 'functions', 'plks', 'currently', 'well', 'tumorigenesis', 'structure', 'sequentially', 'role', 'prominent', 'polo', 'outlined', 'outline', 'non', 'non', 'investigation', 'importantly', 'important', 'correlated', 'comprised', 'combination', 'agents', 'additionally']"
"The Vesical Imaging-Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS) scoring system has been widely used to stage bladder cancer (BCa) since 2018.
To describe the characteristics of cases with discordant T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) scores in patients with BCa and further verify the accuracy of the VI-RADS scoring system and the necessity of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) sequence.
Retrospective.
A total of 106 patients (include 16.5% female) with bladder cancer.
T2WI (fast spin echo), DWI (echo planer imaging), and DCE (gradient echo).
Some cases are difficult to score according to the system, mainly when the T2WI (category 4) and DWI (category 2) sequence scores are discordant, termed the discordant group below. The complementary group will be termed concordant group. Each MRI sequence was reviewed respectively according to the 5-point VI-RADS scoring system by three observers. The diagnostic ability of sequences for evaluating muscle invasion by BCa was calculated using histopathology as the reference standards.
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, DeLong test, intraclass correlation coefficient. A P value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant.
Fourteen cases (13.2%) had discordant VI-RADS scoring system. In the discordant group, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of DCE was 0.875, while the T2WI and DWI showed limited diagnostic performance (AUCs = 0.50). In the concordant group, there was no significant difference in diagnostic efficacy between the overall VI-RADS (AUC: 0.950) and the combination of T2WI and DWI (AUC: 0.946) (P = 0.56). Among all patients, the AUC of overall VIRADS was 0.939 with a 3 or greater cutoff value.
The DCE was crucial in the discordant group for evaluating muscle-invasiveness, while DCE may not be necessary for the concordant group. The VI-RADS scoring system performed with overall good diagnostic performance in evaluating muscle-invasiveness in BCa patients.

"Ductal adenocarcinoma (DA) is an aggressive subtype of prostate cancer. It is most commonly seen in mixed tumors together with conventional acinar adenocarcinoma (AA). The genetic profile of DA and its clonal origin is not fully characterized.
To investigate whether DA represents a distinct genetic subtype and to investigate the somatic relationship between the ductal and acinar components of mixed cancers.
In 17 radical prostatectomy specimens ductal and acinar tumor components from the same tumor foci were dissected. DNA was extracted and genomic sequencing performed. After exclusion of two cases with low cell yield, 15 paired samples remained for analysis.
In 12 of 15 cases a common somatic denominator was identified, while three cases had clonally separate components. In DA, TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusions were detected in 47% (7/15), clonal FOXA1 alterations in 33% (5/15) and SPOP alterations in 27% (4/15) of cases. In one case KIAA1549-BRAF fusion was identified. Genome doubling events, resulting in an increased ploidy, were identified in the DA in 53% (8/15) of cases, but not seen in any AA. PTEN and CTNNB1 alterations were enriched in DA (6/15) but not seen in any AA. No cancers showed microsatellite instability or high tumor mutation burden.

"We report 21 cases of trichogerminoma harbouring previously undescribed FOXK1::GRHL1/2 or GPS2::GRHL1/2/3 in-frame fusion transcripts. Microscopic examination of a preliminary set of five cases revealed well-delimitated tumours located in the dermis with frequent extension to the subcutaneous tissue. Tumours presented a massive and nodular architecture and consisted of a proliferation of basaloid cells. A biphasic pattern sometime resulting in tumour cell nests, (""cell balls"") was present. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the expression of cytokeratins (CK) 15, 17 and PHLDA1. In addition, numerous Cytokeratin 20-positive Merkel cells were detected. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed a FOXK1::GRHL1 chimeric transcript in 3 cases and a FOXK1::GRHL2 fusion in 2 cases. In a second series for validation (n=88), FOXK1::GRHL1/2 fusion transcripts were detected by RT-qPCR or FISH in an 12 additional trichogerminomas and not in any other follicular tumour entities or basal cell carcinoma cases (n= 66). Additional RNA-seq analysis in trichogerminoma cases without detected FOXK1::GRHL1/2 rearrangements revealed GPS2::GRHL1 fusion transcripts in two cases, GPS2::GRHL2 in one and GPS2::GRHL3 fusion transcript in one case.

"Cancer stemness, which covers the stem cell-like molecular traits of cancer cells, is essential for tumor development, progression, and relapse. Both transcriptional and epigenetic aberrations are essentially connected with cancer stemness. The engagement of bromodomain (BrD) proteins - a family of epigenetic factors - has been presented in the pathogenesis of several tumor types, although their association with cancer stemness remains largely unknown. Here, we harnessed TCGA and GEO databases and used several bioinformatic tools (i.e. Oncomine, PrognoScan, GEPIA2, TIMER2.0, TISIDB, GSEA, R2 platform) to characterize the association between the BrD family members' expression and cancer stemness in solid tumors. Our results demonstrate that significant upregulation of ATAD2 and SMARCA4, and downregulation of SMARCA2 is consistently associated with enriched cancer stem cell-like phenotype, respectively.

"The organophosphate compounds chlorpyrifos (O, O-diethyl O-[3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinyl] phosphorothioate, CPF) and phenyl saligenin phosphate (PSP) have been widely implicated in developmental neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Transglutaminase (TG)2 is a calcium ion (Ca2+)-dependent enzyme with an important role in neuronal cell outgrowth and differentiation and in neurotoxin activity and is modulated by organophosphates.
We studied TG2 activity modulation by CPO and PSP during differentiation in C6 glioma cells. We studied the effects of CPO or PSP treatment with or without the TG2 inhibitor Z-DON and identified potential TG2 protein substrates via mass spectrometry.
PSP and CPO did not affect cell viability but affected TG2 activity in differentiating cells. Our results indicate that the organophosphate-induced amine incorporation activity of TG2 may have a direct effect on neuronal outgrowth, differentiation, and cell survival by modifying several essential microtubule proteins, including tubulin. Inhibiting TG2 reduced neurite length but not cell survival.

Intensive cardiac monitoring through electrocardiogram was performed to estimate the severity degree and clinical condition of arrhythmia.
The frequency and severity of the arrhythmia had a strong temporal relationship with the administration of cisplatin, that made it likely that cisplatin was responsible for the cardiotoxicity observed.

This study consisted of one single centre and involved a retrospective review of all patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent HNSCC.

"Glycemic traits-such as hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, and type-2 diabetes-have been associated with higher colorectal cancer risk in observational studies; however, causality of these associations is uncertain. We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to estimate the causal effects of fasting insulin, 2-hour glucose, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and type-2 diabetes with colorectal cancer.
Genome-wide association study summary data were used to identify genetic variants associated with circulating levels of fasting insulin (n = 34), 2-hour glucose (n = 13), fasting glucose (n = 70), HbA1c (n = 221), and type-2 diabetes (n = 268). Using two-sample MR, we examined these variants in relation to colorectal cancer risk (48,214 cases and 64,159 controls).
In inverse-variance models, higher fasting insulin levels increased colorectal cancer risk (odds ratio [OR] per 1-standard deviation [SD]=1.65, 95% CI = 1.15-2.36). We found no evidence of any effect of 2-hour glucose (OR per 1-SD = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.86-1.21) or fasting glucose (OR per 1-SD = 1.04, 95% CI = 0.88-1.23) concentrations on colorectal cancer risk.

Higher HbA1c concentrations increased rectal cancer risk in men (OR per 1-SD = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.05-1.40), but not in women.

"In mammalian cells, small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) negatively regulate gene expression in a pathway known as RNA interference (RNAi). RNAi can be categorized into post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), which involves the cleavage of target messenger RNA (mRNA) or inhibition of translation in the cytoplasm, and transcriptional gene silencing (TGS), which is mediated by the establishment of repressive epigenetic marks at target loci. Transfer RNAs (tRNAs), which are essential for translation, can be processed into small ncRNAs, termed tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs). The biogenesis of tsRNAs and their role in gene expression regulation has not yet been fully understood. Here, we show that Dicer dependent tsRNAs promote gene silencing through a mechanism distinct from PTGS and TGS. tsRNAs can lead to downregulation of target genes by targeting introns via nascent RNA silencing (NRS) in nuclei. Furthermore, we show that Ago2 slicer activity is required for this mechanism. Synthetic tsRNAs can significantly reduce expression of a target gene at both RNA and protein levels. Target genes regulated by NRS are associated with various diseases, which further underpins its biological significance. Finally, we show that NRS is evolutionarily conserved and has the potential to be explored as a novel synthetic sRNA based therapeutic.","['targeting introns via nascent rna silencing', 'dicer dependent tsrnas promote gene silencing', 'novel synthetic srna based therapeutic', 'negatively regulate gene expression', 'transcriptional gene silencing', 'transcriptional gene silencing', 'gene expression regulation', 'significantly reduce expression', 'repressive epigenetic marks', 'ago2 slicer activity', 'target messenger rna', 'target genes regulated', 'derived small rnas', 'target gene', 'synthetic tsrnas', 'rna interference', 'target genes', 'tsrnas ).', 'target loci', 'transfer rnas', 'small non', 'small ncrnas', 'coding rnas', 'various diseases', 'trnas ),', 'termed trna', 'protein levels', 'pathway known', 'mammalian cells', 'fully understood', 'evolutionarily conserved', 'biological significance', 'tgs ),', 'rnai ).', 'ptgs ),', 'mechanism distinct', 'rna', 'tsrnas', 'tsrnas', 'tgs', 'rnai', 'ptgs', 'mechanism', 'yet', 'underpins', 'translation', 'translation', 'sncrnas', 'show', 'show', 'show', 'role', 'required', 'processed', 'potential', 'post', 'nuclei', 'nrs', 'nrs', 'nrs', 'mrna', 'mediated', 'lead', 'involves', 'inhibition', 'furthermore', 'finally', 'explored', 'establishment', 'essential', 'downregulation', 'cytoplasm', 'cleavage', 'categorized', 'biogenesis', 'associated']"

The main supporting documents: protocol and data dictionary, were comprehensively reviewed in a series of meetings over a 10-month period by an international working group. In parallel, individual consultations with local institutions regarding a benchmarking quality-of-care report were conducted. Four consensus areas for improvement emerged: updating operational definitions, appraisal of the recruitment process, refinement of data elements, and improvement of data quality and reporting. Recommendations presented were drawn from our collective experience and accumulated knowledge in operating an international registry. These can be readily generalized to other health-related reporting programs beyond clinical registries.","['related reporting programs beyond clinical registries', 'healthcare institutions across 13 countries', 'local institutions regarding', 'updating operational definitions', 'localized prostate cancer', 'four consensus areas', 'international working group', 'truenth global registry', 'main supporting documents', 'international registry', 'systematic evaluation', 'since 2017', 'recruitment process', 'recommendations presented', 'readily generalized', 'patient outcomes', 'month period', 'individual consultations', 'existing processes', 'evaluate whether', 'data quality', 'data elements', 'data dictionary', 'comprehensively reviewed', 'collective experience', 'collating data', 'care report', 'benchmarking quality', 'accumulated knowledge', 'improvement emerged', 'drive improvement', 'tngr matures', 'reporting', 'registry', 'documents', 'improvement', 'tngr', 'series', 'refinement', 'protocol', 'parallel', 'operating', 'operating', 'necessary', 'meetings', 'intended', 'individuals', 'health', 'drawn', 'conducted', 'appraisal', 'aimed', '10']"
"A prominent aspect of most, if not all, central nervous systems (CNSs) is that anterior regions (brain) are larger than posterior ones (spinal cord). Studies in Drosophila and mouse have revealed that Polycomb Repressor Complex 2 (PRC2), a protein complex responsible for applying key repressive histone modifications, acts by several mechanisms to promote anterior CNS expansion. However, it is unclear what the full spectrum of PRC2 action is during embryonic CNS development and how PRC2 intersects with the epigenetic landscape. We removed PRC2 function from the developing mouse CNS, by mutating the key gene Eed, and generated spatio-temporal transcriptomic data. To decode the role of PRC2, we developed a method that incorporates standard statistical analyses with probabilistic deep learning to integrate the transcriptomic response to PRC2 inactivation with epigenetic data. This multi-variate analysis corroborates the central involvement of PRC2 in anterior CNS expansion, and also identifies several unanticipated cohorts of genes, such as proliferation and immune response genes. Furthermore, the analysis reveals specific profiles of regulation via PRC2 upon these gene cohorts. These findings uncover a differential logic for the role of PRC2 upon functionally distinct gene cohorts that drive CNS anterior expansion. To support the analysis of emerging multi-modal datasets, we provide a novel bioinformatics package that integrates transcriptomic and epigenetic datasets to identify regulatory underpinnings of heterogeneous biological processes.","['prc2 upon functionally distinct gene cohorts', 'applying key repressive histone modifications', 'also identifies several unanticipated cohorts', 'incorporates standard statistical analyses', 'regulation via prc2 upon', 'polycomb repressor complex 2', 'analysis reveals specific profiles', 'promote anterior cns expansion', 'drive cns anterior expansion', 'key gene eed', 'anterior cns expansion', 'protein complex responsible', 'embryonic cns development', 'spinal cord ).', 'probabilistic deep learning', 'novel bioinformatics package', 'identify regulatory underpinnings', 'heterogeneous biological processes', 'variate analysis corroborates', 'removed prc2 function', 'central nervous systems', 'developing mouse cns', 'gene cohorts', 'temporal transcriptomic data', 'immune response genes', 'several mechanisms', 'anterior regions', 'transcriptomic response', 'prc2 intersects', 'prc2 inactivation', 'prc2 action', 'prc2 ),', 'epigenetic data', 'central involvement', 'integrates transcriptomic', 'prominent aspect', 'posterior ones', 'modal datasets', 'generated spatio', 'full spectrum', 'findings uncover', 'epigenetic landscape', 'epigenetic datasets', 'differential logic', 'emerging multi', 'analysis', 'prc2', 'prc2', 'mouse', 'genes', 'multi', 'unclear', 'support', 'studies', 'role', 'role', 'revealed', 'provide', 'proliferation', 'mutating', 'method', 'larger', 'integrate', 'however', 'furthermore', 'drosophila', 'developed', 'decode', 'cnss', 'brain', 'acts']"
"Expression of the E3 ligase TRIM21 is increased in a broad spectrum of cancers; however, the functionally relevant molecular pathway targeted by TRIM21 overexpression remains largely unknown. Here, we show that TRIM21 directly interacts with and ubiquitinates CLASPIN, a mediator for ATR-dependent CHK1 activation. TRIM21-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination of CLASPIN counteracts the K6-linked ubiquitination of CLASPIN which is essential for its interaction with TIPIN and subsequent chromatin loading. We further show that overexpression of TRIM21, but not a TRIM21 catalytically inactive mutant, compromises CHK1 activation, leading to replication fork instability and tumorigenesis. Our findings demonstrate that TRIM21 suppresses CHK1 activation by preferentially targeting CLASPIN for K63-linked ubiquitination, providing a potential target for cancer therapy.","['functionally relevant molecular pathway targeted', 'trim21 overexpression remains largely unknown', 'trim21 catalytically inactive mutant', 'trim21 suppresses chk1 activation', 'dependent chk1 activation', 'compromises chk1 activation', 'trim21 directly interacts', 'subsequent chromatin loading', 'replication fork instability', 'e3 ligase trim21', 'preferentially targeting claspin', 'ubiquitinates claspin', 'potential target', 'linked ubiquitination', 'linked ubiquitination', 'linked ubiquitination', 'findings demonstrate', 'claspin counteracts', 'cancer therapy', 'broad spectrum', 'mediated k63', 'trim21', 'trim21', 'overexpression', 'claspin', 'k63', 'tumorigenesis', 'tipin', 'show', 'show', 'providing', 'mediator', 'leading', 'k6', 'interaction', 'increased', 'however', 'expression', 'essential', 'cancers', 'atr']"
"The aerobic energetic metabolism of eukaryotic cells relies on the glycolytic generation of pyruvate, which is subsequently channelled to the oxidative phosphorylation taking place in mitochondria. However, under conditions limiting oxidative phosphorylation pyruvate is coupled to alternative energetic pathways, e.g. its reduction to lactate catalysed by lactate dehydrogenases (LDHs). This biochemical process is known to induce a significant decrease of cytosolic pH, and is accordingly denoted lactic acidosis. Nevertheless, the mutual dependence of LDHs action and lactic acidosis is far from being fully understood. Using human LDH-A, here we show that when exposed to acidic pH this enzyme is subjected to homotropic allosteric transitions triggered by pyruvate. Conversely, human LDH-A features Michaelis-Menten kinetics at pH values equal to 7.0 or higher. Further, citrate, isocitrate, and malate were observed to activate human LDH-A, both at pH 5.0 and 6.5, with citrate and isocitrate being responsible for major effects. Dynamic light scattering experiments revealed that the occurrence of allosteric kinetics in human LDH-A is mirrored by a consistent dissociation of the enzyme tetramer, suggesting that pyruvate promotes tetramer association under acidic conditions. Finally, using the human liver cancer cell line HepG2 we isolated cells featuring cytosolic pH equal to 7.3 or 6.5, and we observed a concomitant decrease of cytosolic pH and lactate secretion. Overall, our observations indicate the occurrence of a negative feedback between lactic acidosis and human LDH-A activity, and a complex regulation of this feedback by pyruvate and by some intermediates of the Krebs cycle.","['human liver cancer cell line hepg2', 'isolated cells featuring cytosolic ph equal', 'dynamic light scattering experiments revealed', 'conditions limiting oxidative phosphorylation pyruvate', 'oxidative phosphorylation taking place', 'homotropic allosteric transitions triggered', 'pyruvate promotes tetramer association', 'accordingly denoted lactic acidosis', 'eukaryotic cells relies', 'ph values equal', 'alternative energetic pathways', 'aerobic energetic metabolism', 'activate human ldh', 'using human ldh', 'cytosolic ph', 'cytosolic ph', 'acidic conditions', 'human ldh', 'human ldh', 'human ldh', 'lactic acidosis', 'lactic acidosis', 'allosteric kinetics', 'acidic ph', 'enzyme tetramer', 'ph 5', 'subsequently channelled', 'significant decrease', 'observations indicate', 'mutual dependence', 'menten kinetics', 'major effects', 'ldhs action', 'ldhs ).', 'lactate secretion', 'lactate dehydrogenases', 'lactate catalysed', 'krebs cycle', 'glycolytic generation', 'fully understood', 'features michaelis', 'consistent dissociation', 'concomitant decrease', 'complex regulation', 'biochemical process', 'negative feedback', 'pyruvate', 'pyruvate', 'pyruvate', 'using', 'feedback', 'enzyme', '5', '5', 'suggesting', 'subjected', 'show', 'responsible', 'reduction', 'overall', 'occurrence', 'occurrence', 'observed', 'observed', 'nevertheless', 'mitochondria', 'mirrored', 'malate', 'known', 'isocitrate', 'isocitrate', 'intermediates', 'induce', 'however', 'higher', 'g', 'finally', 'far', 'exposed', 'e', 'coupled', 'conversely', 'citrate', 'citrate', 'activity', '7', '7', '6', '6', '3', '0', '0']"
"To help BRCA1/2 mutation carriers make informed decisions regarding use of combined-type oral contraceptive preparation (COCP), absolute risk-benefit estimates are needed for COCP-associated cancer.
For a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 women, we calculated the increased or decreased cumulative incidence of COCP-associated (breast/ovarian/endometrial) cancer, examining 18 scenarios with differences in duration and timing of COCP use, uptake of prophylactic surgeries and menopausal hormone therapy.
COCP use initially increased breast cancer risk, and decreased ovarian/endometrial cancer risk long-term. For 10,000 BRCA1 mutation carriers ten years of COCP use from age 20-30 years resulted in 66 additional COCP-associated cancer cases by the age of 35 years, on top of 625 cases expected for never users. By the age of 70 years such COCP use resulted in 907 fewer cancer cases than the expected 9,093 cases in never users. Triple-negative breast cancer estimates resulted in 196 additional COCP-associated cases by age 40 years, on top of 1,454 expected. For 10,000 BRCA2 mutation carriers using COCP from age 20-30 years, 80 excess cancer cases were estimated by age 40 years on top of 651 expected cases; by the age of 70 years we calculated 382 fewer cases compared to the 6,156 cases expected. The long-term benefit of COCP use diminished after risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) followed by menopausal hormone therapy use.
While COCP use in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers initially increases breast/ovarian/endometrial cancer risk, it strongly decreases lifetime cancer risk. RRSO and menopausal hormone therapy use appear to counteract the long-term COCP-benefit.","['2 mutation carriers make informed decisions regarding use', 'brca2 mutation carriers initially increases breast', '000 brca2 mutation carriers using cocp', 'cocp use initially increased breast cancer risk', '000 brca1 mutation carriers ten years', 'strongly decreases lifetime cancer risk', 'menopausal hormone therapy use appear', 'calculated 382 fewer cases compared', 'negative breast cancer estimates resulted', 'type oral contraceptive preparation', 'menopausal hormone therapy use', '907 fewer cancer cases', '80 excess cancer cases', 'cocp ), absolute risk', 'endometrial cancer risk long', 'menopausal hormone therapy', 'cocp use resulted', 'endometrial cancer risk', 'cocp use diminished', '30 years resulted', 'associated cancer cases', 'reducing bilateral salpingo', 'examining 18 scenarios', '66 additional cocp', '196 additional cocp', '651 expected cases', '625 cases expected', '156 cases expected', 'decreased cumulative incidence', 'age 40 years', 'age 40 years', 'cocp use', 'cocp use', 'cocp use', '000 women', 'associated cancer', '30 years', 'associated cases', '093 cases', 'benefit estimates', 'help brca1', '70 years', '70 years', '35 years', 'breast', 'term cocp', 'expected 9', '454 expected', 'risk', 'prophylactic surgeries', 'never users', 'never users', 'increased', 'hypothetical cohort', 'age 20', 'age 20', 'decreased ovarian', 'cancer', 'term benefit', 'cocp', 'cocp', 'calculated', 'brca1', 'endometrial', 'long', 'long', 'associated', 'age', 'age', 'age', 'term', 'benefit', 'ovarian', 'ovarian', 'uptake', 'triple', 'top', 'top', 'top', 'timing', 'rrso', 'rrso', 'oophorectomy', 'needed', 'followed', 'estimated', 'duration', 'differences', 'counteract', 'combined', '6', '10', '10', '10', '1']"
"What are the comparative pregnancy outcomes in women who receive up to six consecutive cycles of ovulation induction with letrozole versus clomiphene citrate?
The risks of pregnancy, livebirth, multiple gestation, preterm birth, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission and congenital malformations were higher for letrozole compared with clomiphene in participants with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), though no treatment differences were observed in those with unexplained infertility.
Randomized trials have reported higher pregnancy and livebirth rates for letrozole versus clomiphene among individuals with PCOS, but no differences among those with unexplained infertility. None of these trials were designed to study maternal or neonatal complications.
We emulated a hypothetical trial of the comparative effectiveness of letrozole versus clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction among all women, then stratified by PCOS and unexplained infertility status. We used real-world data from a large healthcare claims database in the USA (2011-2015).
We analyzed data from 18 120 women who initiated letrozole and 49 647 women who initiated clomiphene during 2011-2014, and who were aged 18-45 years with no history of diabetes, thyroid disease, liver disease or breast cancer and had no fertility treatments for 3 months before trial initiation. The treatment strategies were clomiphene citrate or letrozole for six consecutive cycles. The outcomes were pregnancy, livebirth, multiple gestation, preterm birth, small for gestational age (SGA), NICU admission and major congenital malformations. We estimated the probability of each outcome under each strategy via pooled logistic regression and used standardization to adjust for confounding and selection bias due to loss to follow-up.
The estimated probabilities of pregnancy, livebirth and neonatal outcomes were similar under each strategy, both overall and among individuals with unexplained infertility. Among women with PCOS, the probability of pregnancy was 43% for letrozole vs 37% for clomiphene (risk difference [RD] = 6.0%; 95% CI: 4.4, 7.7) in the intention-to-treat analyses. The corresponding probability of livebirth was 32% vs 29% (RD = 3.1%; 95% CI: 1.5, 4.8). In per protocol analyses, the risk of multiple gestation was 19% vs 9%, the risk of preterm birth was 20% vs 15%, the risk of SGA was 5% vs 3%, the risk of NICU admission was 22% vs 16% and the risk of congenital malformation was 8% vs 2% among those with a livebirth.
We cannot completely rule out the possibility of residual confounding by body mass index or duration of infertility. However, we adjusted for proxies identified in administrative data and results did not change.
Our findings suggest that for women with unexplained infertility, the two treatments result in comparable probabilities of a livebirth. For women with PCOS, letrozole appears slightly more effective for attaining a livebirth. Neonatal outcomes were similar for the two treatments among women with unexplained infertility; we did not confirm the hypothesized higher risk of adverse neonatal outcomes for clomiphene versus letrozole. The risks of adverse neonatal outcomes were slightly greater among women with PCOS who were treated with letrozole versus clomiphene. It is likely that these effects are partially mediated through an increased risk of multiple gestation among women who received letrozole.

"Combination chemotherapy has shown distinct therapeutic advantages over monotherapy in clinical cancer treatment, especially for two chemotherapeutic drugs with different mechanisms of action. However, how to achieve efficient co-delivery of two or more drugs with different physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties for synergistic therapy is still a huge challenge. In particular, it is even more difficult to efficiently co-deliver a hydrophilic drug and a hydrophobic drug into one nanosystem. Herein, inspired by the natural Watson-Crick base pair molecular recognition in nucleic acids, a reduction-sensitive uracil prodrug of doxorubicin (U-SS-DOX) is synthesized and performs supramolecular co-assembly with cytarabine (Ara-C). Interestingly, the hydrophilic Ara-C molecules could readily co-assemble with U-SS-DOX, and multiple hydrogen bonds are found in the nanoassembly with an ultra-high drug loading rate. Moreover, 1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindotricarbocyanine iodide (DiR) is used as a fluorescent probe to investigate the pharmacokinetics of U : C NPs. It turns out that the DiR-labeled U : C NPs significantly prolong the systemic circulation and promote the tumor-specific accumulation of DiR when compared with DiR solution.

"Having a child with cancer is a burdensome experience for parents. Nurses need to better understand beliefs, hopes, and values of parents to holistically support them, which may have an impact on grief and depression. Thus, the aim of this paper was to highlight the social and spiritual dimensions of parental experiences on end-of-life care of their child with cancer.
A narrative literature review was conducted by systematically searching databases (CINAHL Complete, Academic Search Elite, MEDLINE) for relevant literature. The contents of included studies were critically appraised regarding their methodological quality.
Eleven studies were included. In terms of the social dimension, three categories emerged that are important for parents: Being a Parent, Being in Relationship with the Child, and Being in Relationship with Health Professionals. Parents tried to maintain normality and joy for their child, but also kept control over the situation. They wanted to protect their child from suffering but also felt the need to talk to them about dying. Parents had ambivalent experiences with helpful but also burdensome staff. The spiritual dimension comprised two main categories, Hope and Faith and a Unique Bond. Hope was found to be an important source of strength, while Faith was only mentioned by some parents. For parents the emotional connection with their child constituted a source of meaning as well as a foundation, on which they based their decisions on.
A therapeutic relationship and a supportive environment can be established by healthcare professionals by noticing, encouraging the unique bond between parents and their children, as well as by reflecting and addressing the parents' challenging situation.","['spiritual dimension comprised two main categories', 'three categories emerged', 'systematically searching databases', 'critically appraised regarding', 'better understand beliefs', 'academic search elite', 'also kept control', 'narrative literature review', 'also burdensome staff', 'spiritual dimensions', 'social dimension', 'also felt', 'relevant literature', 'burdensome experience', 'unique bond', 'unique bond', 'supportive environment', 'parental experiences', 'methodological quality', 'maintain normality', 'life care', 'holistically support', 'healthcare professionals', 'health professionals', 'emotional connection', 'eleven studies', 'cinahl complete', 'ambivalent experiences', 'nurses need', 'included studies', 'challenging situation', 'therapeutic relationship', 'child constituted', 'parents tried', 'important source', 'source', 'social', 'situation', 'need', 'included', 'important', 'relationship', 'relationship', 'child', 'child', 'child', 'child', 'child', 'parents', 'parents', 'parents', 'parents', 'parents', 'parents', 'parents', 'parents', 'well', 'well', 'wanted', 'values', 'thus', 'terms', 'talk', 'suffering', 'strength', 'reflecting', 'protect', 'parent', 'paper', 'noticing', 'mentioned', 'medline', 'meaning', 'may', 'joy', 'impact', 'hopes', 'hope', 'hope', 'highlight', 'helpful', 'grief', 'foundation', 'found', 'faith', 'faith', 'established', 'end', 'encouraging', 'dying', 'depression', 'decisions', 'contents', 'conducted', 'children', 'cancer', 'cancer', 'based', 'aim', 'addressing']"
"The association between human papillomavirus (HPV) and human breast cancer (BC) has already been thoroughly studied worldwide with contradictory findings. Although the researchers have tried to minimize the conflict using statistical meta-analysis, because of its shortcomings, there is still a need to evaluate the correlation between HPV and BC using any additional method.
This study was launched to investigate the correlation between HPV and BC through the application of Bradford Hill criteria postulates.
Population-wide studies associating HPV with BC were searched using the PubMed database. Then, the information of HPV burden in BC, normal/benign samples was analyzed, and ultimately Bradford Hill criteria postulates were applied on the collected evidence to explore the relationship between HPV and BC. In addition, to make the outcomes more authentic, we also reviewed the methodologies of previous studies to address the propensity of false results.
After a careful evaluation of the obtained data against major Bradford Hill criteria postulates, it was noted that all these postulates including strength, consistency, biological gradient, temporality, plausibility, experiment, specificity, and analogy were not fulfilled.
The results of the present study have failed to establish a casual association between HPV and BC rather suggested HPV as a cause-effective agent or at least a co-participant in the pathogenesis of BC. The weakness of association especially the low level of consistency across studies, and the lack of specificity of effect, there is a need for more experiments concerning Bradford Hill criteria postulates.","['experiments concerning bradford hill criteria postulates', 'ultimately bradford hill criteria postulates', 'major bradford hill criteria postulates', 'bradford hill criteria postulates', 'conflict using statistical meta', 'wide studies associating hpv', 'bc rather suggested hpv', 'postulates including strength', 'thoroughly studied worldwide', 'human breast cancer', 'consistency across studies', 'previous studies', 'searched using', 'human papillomavirus', 'bc using', 'pubmed database', 'obtained data', 'low level', 'effective agent', 'contradictory findings', 'collected evidence', 'careful evaluation', 'biological gradient', 'benign samples', 'also reviewed', 'additional method', 'hpv burden', 'casual association', 'association especially', 'present study', 'false results', 'consistency', 'hpv', 'hpv', 'hpv', 'hpv', 'hpv', 'association', 'study', 'results', 'bc', 'bc', 'bc', 'bc', 'bc', 'bc', 'weakness', 'tried', 'temporality', 'still', 'specificity', 'specificity', 'shortcomings', 'researchers', 'relationship', 'propensity', 'population', 'plausibility', 'pathogenesis', 'participant', 'outcomes', 'noted', 'normal', 'need', 'need', 'minimize', 'methodologies', 'make', 'least', 'launched', 'lack', 'investigate', 'information', 'fulfilled', 'failed', 'explore', 'experiment', 'evaluate', 'establish', 'effect', 'correlation', 'correlation', 'co', 'cause', 'authentic', 'applied', 'application', 'analyzed', 'analysis', 'analogy', 'although', 'already', 'address', 'addition']"
"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), the most plastic cells of the hematopoietic system exhibit increased tumor infiltrating properties and functional heterogeneity depending on tumor type and associated microenvironment. TAMs constitute a major cell type of cancer-related inflammation, commonly enhancing tumor growth. They are profoundly involved in glioma pathogenesis contributing to many cancer hallmarks such as angiogenesis, survival, metastasis, and immunosuppression. Efficient targeting of TAMs presents a promising approach to tackle glioma progression. Several targeting options involve chemokine signaling axes inhibitors and antibodies, anti-angiogenic factors, immunomodulatory molecules, surface immunoglobulins blockers, receptor and transcription factor inhibitors, as well as microRNAs (miRNAs), administered either as standalones or in combination with other conventional therapies.

"The application of Oxaliplatin (OxPt) in different malignancies is reported to be accompanied by several side effects including neuropathy, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mouth sores, low blood counts, loss of appetite, etc. The passive or active targeting of different tumors can improve OxPt delivery. Considering the demand for novel systems meant to improve the OxPt efficacy and define the shortcomings, we provided an overview of different approaches regarding the delivery of OxPt. There is an extending body of data that exhibits the value of Liposomes and polymer-based drug delivery systems as the most successful systems among the OxPt drug delivery procedures. Several clinical trials have been carried out to investigate the side effects and dose-limiting toxicity of liposomal oxaliplatin such as the assessment on Safety Study of MBP-426 (Liposomal Oxaliplatin Suspension for Injection) to Treat Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors. In addition, several studies indicated the biocompatibility and biodegradability of this product, as well as its option for being fictionalized to derive specialized smart nanosystems for the treatment of cancer. The better delivery of OxPt with weaker side effects could be generated by the exertion of Oxaliplatin, which involves the aggregation of new particles and multifaceted nanocarriers to compose a nanocomposite with both inorganic and organic nanoparticles.","['several side effects including neuropathy', 'derive specialized smart nanosystems', 'weaker side effects could', 'based drug delivery systems', 'oxpt drug delivery procedures', 'several studies indicated', 'several clinical trials', 'successful systems among', 'novel systems meant', 'low blood counts', 'metastatic solid tumors', 'different approaches regarding', 'side effects', 'liposomal oxaliplatin suspension', 'improve oxpt delivery', 'different tumors', 'better delivery', 'different malignancies', 'liposomal oxaliplatin', 'treat advanced', 'safety study', 'oxpt efficacy', 'organic nanoparticles', 'new particles', 'multifaceted nanocarriers', 'mouth sores', 'limiting toxicity', 'extending body', 'active targeting', 'delivery', 'oxpt', 'oxpt', 'oxpt', 'improve', 'oxaliplatin', 'oxaliplatin', 'well', 'vomiting', 'value', 'treatment', 'shortcomings', 'reported', 'provided', 'product', 'polymer', 'passive', 'overview', 'option', 'nausea', 'nanocomposite', 'mbp', 'loss', 'liposomes', 'involves', 'investigate', 'inorganic', 'injection', 'generated', 'fictionalized', 'exhibits', 'exertion', 'etc', 'dose', 'diarrhea', 'demand', 'define', 'data', 'considering', 'compose', 'carried', 'cancer', 'biodegradability', 'biocompatibility', 'assessment', 'application', 'appetite', 'aggregation', 'addition', 'accompanied', '426']"
"Hypoxia is a classical function of the tumor's microenvironment with a substantial effect on the development and therapeutic response of cancer. The hypoxic tumor is a chaotic battle and adaptive landscape. When put in hypoxic environments, cells undergo several biological reactions, including activation of signaling pathways that control proliferation, angiogenesis, and death. These pathways have been adapted by cancer cells to allow tumors to survive and even develop in hypoxic conditions, and poor prognosis is associated with tumor hypoxia. The most relevant transcriptional regulator in response to hypoxia, Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α), has been shown to modulate hypoxic gene expression and signaling transduction networks significantly. The significance of non-coding RNAs in hypoxic tumor regions has been revealed in an increasing number of studies over the past few decades. In regulating hypoxic gene expression, these hypoxia-responsive ncRNAs play pivotal roles. Hypoxia, a general characteristic of the tumor's microenvironment, significantly affects the expression of genes and is closely associated with the development of cancer. Indeed the number of known hypoxia-associated lncRNAs has increased dramatically, demonstrating the growing role of lncRNAs in cascades and responses to hypoxia signaling. Decades of research have helped us create an image of the shift in hypoxic cancer cells' DNA repair capabilities. Emerging evidence suggests that hypoxia can trigger genetic instability in cancer cells because of microenvironmental tumor stress. Researchers have found that critical genes' expression is coordinately repressed by hypoxia within the DNA damage and repair pathways. In this study, we include an update of current knowledge on the presentation, participation, and potential clinical effect of ncRNAs in tumor hypoxia, DNA damage reactions, and genomic instability, with a specific emphasis on their unusual cascade of molecular regulation and malignant progression induced by hypoxia.","['responsive ncrnas play pivotal roles', 'cells undergo several biological reactions', 'signaling transduction networks significantly', 'regulating hypoxic gene expression', 'modulate hypoxic gene expression', 'dna damage reactions', 'relevant transcriptional regulator', 'malignant progression induced', 'helped us create', 'emerging evidence suggests', 'trigger genetic instability', 'potential clinical effect', 'dna repair capabilities', 'microenvironmental tumor stress', 'hypoxic tumor regions', 'hypoxic cancer cells', 'dna damage', 'significantly affects', 'hypoxic tumor', 'hypoxic environments', 'hypoxic conditions', 'cancer cells', 'cancer cells', 'substantial effect', 'genomic instability', 'signaling pathways', 'repair pathways', 'hypoxia signaling', 'unusual cascade', 'specific emphasis', 'poor prognosis', 'molecular regulation', 'inducible factor', 'increased dramatically', 'including activation', 'growing role', 'general characteristic', 'even develop', 'current knowledge', 'coordinately repressed', 'control proliferation', 'coding rnas', 'classical function', 'chaotic battle', 'allow tumors', 'adaptive landscape', '1α ),', '1 alpha', 'closely associated', 'therapeutic response', 'increasing number', 'critical genes', 'tumor hypoxia', 'tumor hypoxia', 'known hypoxia', 'hypoxia within', 'associated lncrnas', 'ncrnas', 'expression', 'expression', 'tumor', 'tumor', 'cancer', 'cancer', 'pathways', 'associated', 'response', 'number', 'lncrnas', 'genes', 'hypoxia', 'hypoxia', 'hypoxia', 'hypoxia', 'hypoxia', 'hypoxia', 'hypoxia', 'update', 'survive', 'study', 'studies', 'significance', 'shown', 'shift', 'revealed', 'responses', 'researchers', 'research', 'put', 'presentation', 'past', 'participation', 'non', 'microenvironment', 'microenvironment', 'indeed', 'include', 'image', 'hif', 'found', 'development', 'development', 'demonstrating', 'decades', 'decades', 'death', 'cascades', 'angiogenesis', 'adapted']"
"Scientists encounter many obstacles in traditional cancer therapies, including the side effects on the healthy cells, drug resistance, tumor relapse, the short half-life of employed drugs in the blood circulation, and the improper delivery of drugs toward the tumor site. The unique traits of stem cells (SCs) such as self-renewal, differentiation, tumor tropism, the release of bioactive molecules, and immunosuppression have opened a new window for utilizing SCs as a novel tool in cancer treatment. In this regard, engineered SCs can secrete anti-cancer proteins or express enzymes used in suicide gene therapy which locally induce apoptosis in neoplastic cells via the bystander effect. These cells also stand as proper candidates to serve as careers for drug-loaded nanoparticles or to play suitable hosts for oncolytic viruses. Moreover, they harbor great potential to be employed in immunotherapy and combination therapy. However, tactful strategies should be devised to allow easier transplantation and protection of SCs from in vivo immune responses. In spite of the great hope concerning SCs application in cancer therapy, there are shortcomings and challenges to be addressed. This review tends to elaborate on recent advances on the various applications of SCs in cancer therapy and existing challenges in this regard.","['great hope concerning scs application', 'scientists encounter many obstacles', 'harbor great potential', 'vivo immune responses', 'play suitable hosts', 'locally induce apoptosis', 'express enzymes used', 'allow easier transplantation', 'neoplastic cells via', 'cells also stand', 'suicide gene therapy', 'traditional cancer therapies', 'stem cells', 'healthy cells', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer therapy', 'combination therapy', 'cancer treatment', 'cancer proteins', 'various applications', 'utilizing scs', 'unique traits', 'tumor tropism', 'tumor site', 'tumor relapse', 'tactful strategies', 'side effects', 'short half', 'secrete anti', 'review tends', 'recent advances', 'proper candidates', 'oncolytic viruses', 'novel tool', 'new window', 'loaded nanoparticles', 'improper delivery', 'engineered scs', 'drugs toward', 'bystander effect', 'blood circulation', 'bioactive molecules', 'existing challenges', 'employed drugs', 'drug resistance', 'scs', 'scs', 'scs', 'employed', 'drug', 'challenges', 'spite', 'shortcomings', 'serve', 'self', 'renewal', 'release', 'regard', 'regard', 'protection', 'opened', 'moreover', 'life', 'including', 'immunotherapy', 'immunosuppression', 'however', 'elaborate', 'differentiation', 'devised', 'careers', 'addressed']"
"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are now being considered as the initial component in the development of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD). Our aim was to develop a CSCrelated signature to assess the prognosis of PAAD patients for the optimization of treatment.
Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between pancreatic tumor and normal tissue in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were screened out, and the weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was employed to identify the CSC-related gene sets. Then, univariate, Lasso Cox regression analyses and multivariate Cox regression were applied to construct a prognostic signature using the CSC-related genes. Its prognostic performance was validated in TCGA and ICGC cohorts. Furthermore, Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to identify independent prognostic factors in PAAD, and a prognostic nomogram was established.
The Kaplan-Meier analysis, ROC curve and C-index indicated the good performance of the CSC-related signature at predicting overall survival (OS). Univariate Cox regression and multivariate Cox regression revealed that the CSC-related signature was an independent prognostic factor in PAAD. The nomogram was superior to the risk model and AJCC stage in predicting OS. In terms of mutation and tumor immunity, patients in the high-risk group had higher tumor mutation burden (TMB) scores than patients in the low-risk group, and the immune score and the ESTIMATE score were significantly lower in the high-risk group. Moreover, according to the results of principal component analysis (PCA) and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), the low-risk and high-risk groups displayed different stemness statuses based on the risk model.

"Lay abstract Autophagy is an important metabolic process in cells. Also known as type II cell death, it is a process in which cells degrade their damaged organelles and macromolecular substances by lysosomes. Autophagy is reported to be involved in the development of multiple tumor types, including esophageal carcinoma (ESCA). Autophagy-related genes (ARGs) are those genes proved to be closely related to, or in control of, autophagy. We aimed to identify a model for predicting prognosis based on ARGs, using gene expression profiles and clinical data of ESCA patients from an online database. We identified 28 ARGs as having significantly different activity in ESCA cells compared with normal cells. Among them, four genes were less active, and 24 genes were more active in cancer. Seven ARGs were screened to construct the prognostic model. The effectiveness of the model in predicting the prognosis of ESCA patients was confirmed by standard statistical methods.

"Background The impact of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on the prognostic utility of cardiovascular biomarkers in high-risk patients remains unclear. Methods and Results We performed a multicenter, prospective cohort study of 3255 patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease (CAD) to investigate whether CKD modifies the prognostic utility of cardiovascular biomarkers. Serum levels of cardiovascular and renal biomarkers, including soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high-sensitivity cardiac troponin-I (hs-cTnI), cystatin C, and placental growth factor, were measured in 1301 CKD and 1954 patients without CKD. The urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) was measured in patients with CKD. The primary outcome was 3-point MACE (3P-MACE) defined as a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke. The secondary outcomes were all-cause death, cardiovascular death, and 5P-MACE defined as a composite of 3P-MACE, heart failure hospitalization, and coronary/peripheral artery revascularization. After adjustment for clinical confounders, sFlt-1, NT-proBNP, and hs-cTnI, but not other biomarkers, were significantly associated with 3P-MACE, all-cause death, and cardiovascular death in the entire cohort and in patients without CKD. These associations were still significant in CKD only for NT-proBNP and hs-cTnI. NT-proBNP and hs-cTnI were also significantly associated with 5P-MACE in CKD. The UACR was not significantly associated with any outcomes in CKD. NT-proBNP and hs-cTnI added incremental prognostic information for all outcomes to the model with potential clinical confounders in CKD.

"Multiple investigations are available to aid the diagnosis and monitoring of disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Fecal calprotectin (FC) is an established surrogate for intestinal inflammatory activity. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) including thiopurine metabolites, anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels and antidrug antibody measurements are a step toward personalized medicine in IBD, but face access barriers. We aimed to assess test availability and barriers for these investigations in European practice.
Five-hundred questionnaires were distributed to workshop participants at the 11th Congress of the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO). Access to FC, TDM for thiopurines and anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, as well as factors associated with usage and barriers to access were recorded.
Responses were obtained from 195 attendees from 38 countries across a range of practices, healthcare settings and levels of experience. FC was available to 92.3% while access to anti-TNF (78.9%, P = 0.02 vs.  thiopurine TDM, P = 0.0002 vs.  FC) and thiopurine TDM (67.7%, P = 0.0001) were less widespread. Cost was a frequently cited barrier to test access or usage, with access having a significant West-East and North-South divide across all three investigations. The strongest independent predictor of access to all tests was healthcare spending per capita (P = 0.005 for FC; P < 0.0001 for both TDM).

"There is growing evidence which indicates that the development and the biological features of cancer such as the invasion, metastases and recurrence are related to the presence and behavior of the cancer stem cells (CSC). However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying CSCs-specific properties are poorly determined, the Hippo pathway has emerged as a fundamental regulator underlying CSCs stemness. Immunohistochemical method was used to examine the immunoexpression of SOX2, TAZ and α-SMA in oral squamous cells carcinomas: with metastases - OSCC M+ (n = 42), and without metastases - OSCC M- (n = 44), and 17 control cases. The immunoexpression of SOX2, TAZ and α-SMA was significantly increased in both group of OSCC in comparison to control groups. Moreover, significantly increased TAZ and α-SMA immunoexpression were found in OSCC M+ compared to OSCC M-. In OSCC M+ and OSCC M- groups there were statistically significant correlations between the immunoexpression of TAZ vs SOX2 (r = 0.56, p < 0.001; r = 0.33, p < 0.03 respectively), and TAZ vs α-SMA (r = 0.64, p < 0.001; r = 0.67, p < 0.001 respectively). Moreover, there was statistically significant association between TAZ high /SOX2 high coexistent immunoexpression and the presence of metastases (p < 0.007).

"Solid pseudopapillary neoplasm (SPN) is a pancreatic tumor, which should be distinguished from neuroendocrine tumors (NET). It was postulated that SPN arise from the neural crest (NC). The purpose of the study was to examine expression levels of NC markers: L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) and nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR) in SPN and NET using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and tissue microarrays, aiming to test their potential utility as auxiliary IHC markers for differential diagnosis of SPN vs. NET. In the training cohort (n = 16 SPN), all cases showed L1CAM expression (usually weak, median extent 45% of cells), and NGFR expression (usually moderate to strong, median extent 100% of cells). In the validation cohort (n = 10 SPN), 90% of cases were L1CAM-positive (usually weak expression, median extent 15% of cells), and 100% were NGFR-positive (usually weak expression, median extent 70% of cells). Among NET cases (n = 29) L1CAM was found in 2 (7%), and NGFR in 1 case (3%). L1CAM and NGFR were expressed in SPN, but the intensities and extent of IHC staining differed across the cases.

"The disease entity of TFEB-amplified renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been recently established. In this article, we review such cases. Clinically, the age of patients ranged from 28 to 83 years with a mean age of 62.8 years. The size of the tumor ranged from 1.9 to 19.5 cm with a mean size of 8.7 cm. The tumor demonstrated a variety of architectural patterns such as solid, alveolar, papillary, pseudopapillary, nested or tubular. The International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grade usually corresponds to grade 3 or 4. Cytomorphology shows eosinophilic, clear, amphophilic or even oncocytic cytoplasm. Necrosis can be frequently observed. Neoplastic cells with TFEB-amplified RCC show diffuse or patchy positivity for TFEB. Fluorescence in situ hybridization frequently show the amplification of more than 10 or 20 copies of the TFEB gene. Most TFEB-amplified RCCs behave in an aggressive fashion. Metastasis frequently occurs. In conclusion, this tumor seems to be characterized by occurrence in older patients, frequent necrosis, papillary/pseudopapillary growth pattern, high-grade nuclear grade, TFEB gene amplification, and aggressive clinical behavior. In order to clarify whether this tumor is a distinct entity from previously described renal tumors or not, a further examination in a large scale study will be required in the future.","['previously described renal tumors', 'amplified renal cell carcinoma', 'situ hybridization frequently show', 'amplified rcc show diffuse', 'amplified rccs behave', 'metastasis frequently occurs', 'large scale study', 'even oncocytic cytoplasm', 'cytomorphology shows eosinophilic', 'grade usually corresponds', 'grade nuclear grade', 'aggressive clinical behavior', 'pseudopapillary growth pattern', 'tfeb gene amplification', 'frequently observed', 'grade 3', 'aggressive fashion', 'urological pathology', 'tfeb gene', 'recently established', 'patients ranged', 'patchy positivity', 'older patients', 'neoplastic cells', 'international society', 'distinct entity', 'disease entity', 'clarify whether', 'architectural patterns', '83 years', '7 cm', '5 cm', '20 copies', 'tumor seems', 'tumor ranged', 'tumor demonstrated', 'mean size', 'mean age', 'frequent necrosis', '8 years', 'rcc', 'pseudopapillary', 'amplification', 'tumor', 'tfeb', 'tfeb', 'tfeb', 'tfeb', 'size', 'necrosis', 'age', '8', 'variety', 'tubular', 'solid', 'review', 'required', 'papillary', 'papillary', 'order', 'occurrence', 'nested', 'isup', 'high', 'future', 'fluorescence', 'examination', 'conclusion', 'clinically', 'clear', 'characterized', 'cases', 'article', 'amphophilic', 'alveolar', '9', '62', '4', '28', '19', '10', '1']"

This study aimed to investigate the effects of MSCs in controlling B cells through IDO expression in PBMC of SLE patients. Methods This study used a post-test control group design. MSCs were obtained from human umbilical cord blood and characterized according to their surface antigen expression and multilineage differentiation capacities. PBMCs isolated from SLE patients were divided into five groups: sham, control, and three treatment groups. The treatment groups were treated by co-culturing MSCs to PBMCs with a ratio of 1:10, 1:25, and 1:40 for 72 h incubation. The B cell levels were analysed by flow cytometry with cytometric bead array (CBA) and the IDO levels were determined by ELISA. Results The percentages of B cells decreased significantly in groups treated by dose-dependent MSCs, particularly in T1 and T2 groups.

"This article tries to facilitate the management of mastalgia. During their lifetime most women will experience breast pain. Many of them will visit a physician for this purpose, often led by the fear of cancer. However, in the absence of other clinical signs such as a lump or nipple discharge, the risk of malignancy remains low. In addition to the patient's medical history and physical examination, an imaging may be necessary. The absence of clinical or radiological abnormalities suffices to reassure patients in most cases. The management of mastalgia is based mainly on diet and life-style changes, the use of a well-suited bra and topical anti-inflammatory medication. In the case of mastalgia not responding to first line treatments, the patient should be referred to a breast-care unit.

The present study evaluated the histopathological findings of the coexistence pattern of superficial carcinomas adjacent to NENs in the esophagogastrointestinal tract.
From 2000 to 2019, 35 serial NEN resections of the esophagus (n = 9), stomach (n = 3), and large intestine (n = 23), respectively, were performed at Gunma University Hospital.

Among the 35 serial NEN samples, squamous cell carcinomatous/dysplastic components were identified 77.8% (7/9 cases) of esophageal NENs, and adenocarcinomatous areas were seen in 66.7% (2/3 cases) of gastric NENs and 26% (6/23 cases) of colorectal NENs. Thus, all superficial carcinomatous components adjacent to NENs were observed as squamous cell carcinoma/dysplasia in esophagus and adenocarcinoma in stomach and large intestine, which showed histological characteristics as the resident epithelial pattern in each organ.
These findings suggested a potential ""paratransformation"" or ""bystander effect"" in resident epithelium by NENs. Thus, ""bystander carcinogenesis"" could be a pathogenic mechanism of resident epithelium transformation adjacent to NENs in the esophagogastrointestinal tract.","['35 serial nen samples', '35 serial nen resections', 'resident epithelium transformation adjacent', '35 serial nen cases', 'superficial carcinomatous components adjacent', 'superficial carcinomas adjacent', 'superficial carcinoma adjacent', 'squamous cell carcinomatous', 'resident superficial epithelium', 'squamous cell carcinoma', 'showed histological characteristics', 'present study evaluated', 'gunma university hospital', 'two additional cases', 'resident epithelial pattern', '23 ), respectively', 'comprising dual neuroendocrine', 'rare neuroendocrine neoplasm', '9 ), stomach', 'resident epithelium', '9 cases', '23 cases', '3 ),', 'neuroendocrine neoplasm', '3 cases', 'neuroendocrine components', 'neuroendocrine components', 'coexistent pattern', 'coexistence pattern', 'coexistence pattern', 'dysplastic components', 'mixed neuroendocrine', 'pathogenic mechanism', 'large intestine', 'large intestine', 'identified 77', 'histopathological findings', 'findings suggested', 'esophagogastrointestinal tract', 'esophagogastrointestinal tract', 'bystander effect', 'bystander carcinogenesis', 'borderline areas', 'affiliated hospitals', 'adenocarcinomatous areas', 'definitive minen', 'gastric nens', 'esophageal nens', 'colorectal nens', 'nen', 'nen', 'nen', 'components', 'neuroendocrine', 'stomach', 'minen', 'nens', 'nens', 'nens', 'nens', 'well', 'thus', 'thus', 'thought', 'seen', 'potential', 'performed', 'paratransformation', 'overlap', 'organ', 'observed', 'observed', 'non', 'non', 'non', 'n', 'n', 'n', 'may', 'esophagus', 'esophagus', 'dysplasia', 'could', 'among', 'although', 'adenocarcinoma', '8', '7', '7', '66', '6', '26', '2019', '2000', '2']"
"Mechanisms underlying the adiposity-cancer relationship are incompletely understood. We quantified the mediating roles of C-reactive protein (CRP), leptin, fasting insulin, and estradiol in the effect of adiposity on estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast, endometrial, and colorectal cancer risk in postmenopausal women.
We used a case-cohort study within the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, analyzed as a cumulative sampling case-control study. The study included 188 breast cancer cases, 98 endometrial cancer cases, 193 colorectal cancer cases, and 285 controls.

"Glioblastoma is the central nervous system tumor with the highest mortality rate, and the clinical effectiveness of chemotherapy is low. Curzerene can inhibit the progression of non-small-cell lung cancer, but its role in glioma has not been reported. The purpose of this study was to clarify the effect of curzerene on glioma progression and further explore its potential mechanism.
The expression of glutathione S-transferase A4 (GSTA4) in glioblastoma and the effect of curzerene on the expression of GSTA4 and matrix metalloproteinase 9 and the activation of the mTOR pathway were detected by Western blotting and RT-PCR, and the effects of curzerene treatment on glioma malignant character were detected by cell biological assays. The in vivo antitumor effects of curzerene were analyzed in a nude mouse xenograft model.
Curzerene was found to inhibit the expression of GSTA4 mRNA and protein in U251 and U87 glioma cells, and this effect correlated with a downregulation of the proliferation of these cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Invasion and migration were also inhibited, and curzerene treatment correlated with induction of apoptosis. Curzerene inhibited the activation of the mTOR pathway and the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9, and it correlated with increased 4-hydroxynonenal levels. In vivo, curzerene was found to significantly inhibit tumor growth in nude mice and to prolong the survival time of tumor-bearing nude mice.
In conclusion, inhibition of GSTA4 correlates with positive outcomes in glioma models, and thus, this molecule is a candidate drug for the treatment of glioma.","['nude mouse xenograft model', 'central nervous system tumor', 'significantly inhibit tumor growth', 'matrix metalloproteinase 9', 'matrix metalloproteinase 9', 'highest mortality rate', 'cell lung cancer', 'cell biological assays', 'bearing nude mice', 'glioma malignant character', 'vivo antitumor effects', 'u87 glioma cells', 'nude mice', 'curzerene treatment correlated', 'western blotting', 'transferase a4', 'potential mechanism', 'positive outcomes', 'mtor pathway', 'mtor pathway', 'increased 4', 'hydroxynonenal levels', 'glioma models', 'dependent manner', 'clinical effectiveness', 'candidate drug', 'also inhibited', 'survival time', 'gsta4 mrna', 'gsta4 correlates', 'glioma progression', 'curzerene treatment', 'curzerene inhibited', 'effect correlated', 'tumor', 'vivo', 'treatment', 'inhibit', 'inhibit', 'glioma', 'glioma', 'effects', 'correlated', 'cells', 'time', 'progression', 'gsta4', 'gsta4', 'curzerene', 'curzerene', 'curzerene', 'curzerene', 'curzerene', 'curzerene', 'effect', 'effect', 'u251', 'thus', 'study', 'small', 'rt', 'role', 'reported', 'purpose', 'protein', 'prolong', 'proliferation', 'pcr', 'non', 'molecule', 'migration', 'low', 'invasion', 'inhibition', 'induction', 'glutathione', 'glioblastoma', 'glioblastoma', 'found', 'found', 'expression', 'expression', 'expression', 'expression', 'explore', 'downregulation', 'dose', 'detected', 'detected', 'conclusion', 'clarify', 'chemotherapy', 'apoptosis', 'analyzed', 'activation', 'activation']"
"Age-related loss of cellular function and increased cell death are characteristic hallmarks of aging. While defects in gene expression and RNA metabolism have been linked with age-associated human neuropathies, it is not clear how the changes that occur in aging neurons contribute to loss of gene expression homeostasis. R-loops are RNA-DNA hybrids that typically form co-transcriptionally via annealing of the nascent RNA to the template DNA strand, displacing the non-template DNA strand. Dysregulation of R-loop homeostasis has been associated with both transcriptional impairment and genome instability. Importantly, a growing body of evidence links R-loop accumulation with cellular dysfunction, increased cell death, and chronic disease onset. Here, we characterized the R-loop landscape in aging Drosophila melanogaster photoreceptor neurons and showed that bulk R-loop levels increased with age. Further, genome-wide mapping of R-loops revealed that transcribed genes accumulated R-loops over gene bodies during aging, which correlated with decreased expression of long and highly expressed genes. Importantly, while photoreceptor-specific down-regulation of Top3β, a DNA/RNA topoisomerase associated with R-loop resolution, lead to decreased visual function, over-expression of Top3β or nuclear-localized RNase H1, which resolves R-loops, enhanced positive light response during aging. Together, our studies highlight the functional link between dysregulation of R-loop homeostasis, gene expression, and visual function during aging.","['aging drosophila melanogaster photoreceptor neurons', 'enhanced positive light response', 'transcribed genes accumulated r', 'highly expressed genes', 'typically form co', 'transcriptionally via annealing', 'localized rnase h1', 'increased cell death', 'increased cell death', 'chronic disease onset', 'aging neurons contribute', 'associated human neuropathies', 'template dna strand', 'template dna strand', 'loop levels increased', 'evidence links r', 'rna topoisomerase associated', 'decreased visual function', 'gene expression homeostasis', 'visual function', 'loop homeostasis', 'loop homeostasis', 'decreased expression', 'cellular function', 'gene expression', 'gene expression', 'gene bodies', 'dna hybrids', 'loop resolution', 'loop landscape', 'loop accumulation', 'wide mapping', 'transcriptional impairment', 'studies highlight', 'rna metabolism', 'nascent rna', 'growing body', 'functional link', 'characteristic hallmarks', 'cellular dysfunction', 'resolves r', 'bulk r', 'related loss', 'genome instability', 'loops revealed', 'photoreceptor', 'associated', 'dna', 'rna', 'expression', 'aging', 'aging', 'aging', 'aging', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'r', 'loss', 'genome', 'loops', 'loops', 'loops', 'top3β', 'top3β', 'together', 'specific', 'showed', 'regulation', 'occur', 'nuclear', 'non', 'long', 'linked', 'lead', 'importantly', 'importantly', 'dysregulation', 'dysregulation', 'displacing', 'defects', 'correlated', 'clear', 'characterized', 'changes', 'age', 'age', 'age']"
"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a breast cancer subtype without targeted treatment options. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated the roles of circular RNAs in cancer. This study aimed to investigate the expression and function of circFAM64A in TNBC. The GSE101124 dataset from the GEO database was examined to identify the differentially expressed circular RNAs in TNBC. RT-qPCR and western blot analyses were performed to measure gene expression. TNBC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and cell cycle were assessed using cell counting kit-8, EdU, flow cytometry, wound healing, and transwell invasion experiments. Bioinformatics analysis, RIP, RNA pulldown, and luciferase reporter assays were used to investigate the regulatory mechanism of circFAM64A. In this study, CircFAM64A expression was significantly upregulated in TNBC tissues and cells compared with normal tissues and cells. Overexpression of circFAM64A increased the proliferative, migratory, and invasive capacities of TNBC cells and promoted cell cycle progression. Mechanistically, circFAM64A acted as a molecular sponge for miR-149-5p, and miR-149-5p directly targeted the Cdc10-dependent transcript 1 (CDT1) 3'UTR. Moreover, the high expression of CDT1 is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. Rescue experiments demonstrated that circFAM64A sponged miR-149-5p to increase CDT1 expression, thereby promoting cellular processes in TNBC. Overall, CircFAM64A plays an oncogenic role in TNBC by interacting with miR-149-5p to increase CDT1 expression.","['breast cancer subtype without targeted treatment options', 'assessed using cell counting kit', 'thereby promoting cellular processes', 'promoted cell cycle progression', 'differentially expressed circular rnas', 'negative breast cancer', '5p directly targeted', 'western blot analyses', 'luciferase reporter assays', 'dependent transcript 1', 'measure gene expression', 'transwell invasion experiments', 'tnbc cell proliferation', 'rescue experiments demonstrated', 'increase cdt1 expression', 'increase cdt1 expression', 'breast cancer', 'cell cycle', 'circfam64a sponged mir', 'circular rnas', 'high expression', 'circfam64a expression', 'wound healing', 'significantly upregulated', 'rna pulldown', 'regulatory mechanism', 'poor prognosis', 'oncogenic role', 'normal tissues', 'molecular sponge', 'invasive capacities', 'gse101124 dataset', 'geo database', 'flow cytometry', 'bioinformatics analysis', 'accumulating evidence', 'circfam64a plays', 'circfam64a increased', 'circfam64a acted', 'cells compared', 'tnbc tissues', 'study aimed', 'cancer', 'tnbc cells', 'expression', 'invasion', 'demonstrated', 'cdt1', 'cdt1', 'circfam64a', 'circfam64a', 'cells', 'tnbc', 'tnbc', 'tnbc', 'tnbc', 'tnbc', 'study', 'mir', 'mir', 'mir', '5p', '5p', '5p', 'utr', 'used', 'triple', 'rt', 'roles', 'rip', 'qpcr', 'proliferative', 'performed', 'patients', 'overexpression', 'overall', 'moreover', 'migratory', 'migration', 'mechanistically', 'investigate', 'investigate', 'interacting', 'identify', 'function', 'examined', 'edu', 'cdc10', 'associated', '8', '3', '149', '149', '149', '149']"

"This study examines the language environments of bilingually raised Latinx infants (n = 37) in mother-father families of diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, with a focus on paternal parentese, a speaking style distinguished by higher pitch, slower tempo, and exaggerated intonation. Two daylong audio recordings were collected on weekends, when both parents were at home. Paternal, maternal, and infant speech variables were quantified through automatic and manual analyses. Most infants experienced Spanish and English within child-directed speech, and language mixing was common in mothers and fathers. Adjusting for demographic variables, infants heard 50.4% less talk from men compared to women, and 43.4% less parentese from fathers compared to mothers. However, when controlling for overall speech amount, the rate of parentese use did not differ between mothers and fathers, demonstrating that, contrary to the stereotype, fathers in Latinx families adjust their speech in verbal interactions with their infants. An asymmetry emerged, where paternal parentese was associated with paternal knowledge of language development but not with paternal involvement in childcare responsibilities; the opposite was true for paternal speech amount. Controlling for maternal contributions, paternal parentese was predictive of concurrent parent-infant turn-taking and infant language vocalizations, demonstrating its important role in infant language development.","['two daylong audio recordings', 'bilingually raised latinx infants', 'speaking style distinguished', 'latinx families adjust', 'english within child', 'diverse socioeconomic backgrounds', 'infants heard 50', 'infants experienced spanish', 'overall speech amount', 'infant language vocalizations', 'infant speech variables', 'infant language development', 'paternal speech amount', 'language development', 'infant turn', 'father families', 'demographic variables', 'language mixing', 'language environments', 'directed speech', 'verbal interactions', 'study examines', 'slower tempo', 'paternal parentese', 'paternal parentese', 'paternal parentese', 'paternal knowledge', 'paternal involvement', 'parentese use', 'men compared', 'manual analyses', 'less talk', 'less parentese', 'important role', 'higher pitch', 'exaggerated intonation', 'concurrent parent', 'childcare responsibilities', 'asymmetry emerged', 'maternal contributions', 'fathers compared', 'infants', 'speech', 'paternal', 'maternal', 'fathers', 'fathers', 'fathers', 'women', 'weekends', 'true', 'taking', 'stereotype', 'rate', 'quantified', 'predictive', 'parents', 'opposite', 'n', 'mothers', 'mothers', 'mothers', 'mother', 'however', 'home', 'focus', 'differ', 'demonstrating', 'demonstrating', 'controlling', 'controlling', 'contrary', 'common', 'collected', 'automatic', 'associated', 'adjusting', '43', '4', '4', '37']"
"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are key regulatory factors in the development of multiple cancers. This study is targeted at exploring the effect of circ_0002623 on bladder cancer (BCa) progression and its mechanism. Circ_0002623 was screened out by analyzing the expression profile of circRNAs in BCa tissues. Circ_0002623, miR-1276 and SMAD2 mRNA expression levels in clinical sample tissues and cell lines were detected through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). After circ_0002623 was overexpressed or silenced in BCa cells, the cell proliferation, migration and cell cycle were evaluated by CCK-8, BrdU, Transwell assay and flow cytometry. Tumor xenograft model was used to validate the biological function of circ_0002623 in vivo. Bioinformatics analysis and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay were conducted for analyzing and confirming, respectively, the targeted relationship between circ_0002623 and miR-1276, as well as between miR-1276 and SMAD2. The regulatory effects of circ_0002623 and miR-1276 on the expression levels of TGF-β, WNT1 and SMAD2 in BCa cells were detected by Western blot. We reported that, in BCa tissues and cell lines, circ_0002623 was up-regulated, whereas miR-1276 was down-regulated. Circ_0002623 positively regulated BCa cell proliferation, migration and cell cycle progression. Additionally, circ_0002623 could competitively bind with miR-1276 to increase the expression of SMAD2, the target gene of miR-1276.

"Perceived cancer-related stigma can affect mental health and potentially treatment choices for patients with cancer. Nevertheless, perceived stigma is not very well understood in Asia. This study investigated across six developing Asian countries: 1) the prevalence of perceived stigma among advanced cancer patients, 2) its risk factors, and 3) its association with patient treatment preferences.
This cross-sectional study recruited patients receiving oncology care across major hospitals in Bangladesh, China, India, Philippines, Sri Lanka and Vietnam. Participants (N = 1358) were adults diagnosed with stage IV metastatic solid cancer who completed self-reported surveys. Multi-variable logistic regression and ordered logit models examined the associations with perceived stigma and variables of interest.
Across the countries, 35%, 95% CI [32%, 38%] of patients reported experiencing at least one facet of cancer-related stigma often or always, while 60% [57%, 63%] reported it occurring occasionally. Top-endorsed facets of perceived stigma across the Asian countries suggest a distinct pattern. Having knowingly engaged in health-risk behaviours (OR = 2.03-2.24, 95% CI [1.14-1.19, 3.43-4.41]), unemployment (2.64 [1.67, 4.19]) and body image change (1.57 [1.00, 2.45]) were associated with higher odds of perceived stigma, while time mitigated perceived stigma (0.49-0.65 [0.30-0.45, 0.76-0.92]). Perceived stigma was associated with lower odds of preference for life-extending treatments, although the associations did not hold up in the adjusted model.
Perceived stigma is unique among Asian advanced cancer patients.

"Plasmodium falciparum plasmepsin X (PfPMX), involved in the invasion and egress of this deadliest malarial parasite, is essential for its survival and hence considered as an important drug target. We report the first crystal structure of PfPMX zymogen containing a novel fold of its prosegment. A unique twisted loop from the prosegment and arginine 244 from the mature enzyme are involved in zymogen inactivation; such mechanism, not previously reported, might be common for apicomplexan proteases similar to PfPMX. The maturation of PfPMX zymogen occurs through cleavage of its prosegment at multiple sites. Our data provide thorough insights into the mode of binding of a substrate and a potent inhibitor 49c to PfPMX. We present molecular details of inactivation, maturation, and inhibition of PfPMX that should aid in the development of potent inhibitors against pepsin-like aspartic proteases from apicomplexan parasites.

Five databases including Medline, Dentistry and Oral Sciences, CINAHL, CAPLUS, Web of Science, and grey literature were searched for articles any time up to December 2020. Using Rayyan software two-independent researchers screened 233 articles and extracted 41 for further investigation. Based on the inclusion criteria, 18 articles were eligible for this review.
Aberrant morphology, cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, reduced viability, delayed fibroblast migration, and genotoxicity were statistically significant when the head, neck, and oral cells were exposed to e-cigarettes. Of note, most articles in this systematic review found cigarette smoke to be significantly more toxic to head, neck, and oral cells than e-cigarettes.
E-cigarettes are implicated in adverse effects on head, neck, and oral cells yet, very few have been tested against these cells. More longitudinal studies using a wider variety of e-cigarettes are necessary before we can determine their total adverse effects.

"Aberrant activation of eIF4E contributes to gastric cancer growth and resistance. MNKs regulate eIF4E phosphorylation and activity in tumor but not normal cells, and are potentially safe targets for the treatment of various cancers. Our work reveals that tomivosertib, a potent and highly selective dual MNK1/2 inhibitor, preferentially sensitizes gastric cancer to chemotherapy via suppressing MNK-eIF4E-β-catenin. We firstly demonstrate that tomivosertib displays higher efficacy than other MNK inhibitors in inhibiting gastric cancer cells. In addition, tomivosertib significantly augments the inhibitory effects of 5-FU and paclitaxel but not everolimus, suggesting that tomivosertib preferentially sensitizes gastric cancer to chemotherapy. We next show that eIF4E overexpression and phosphorylation coordinately regulate β-catenin signaling in gastric cancer. Rescue studies confirm that tomivosertib inhibits gastric cancer via targeting MNK- eIF4E-β-catenin. Finally, we demonstrate that the in vitro functional and mechanism observations are translatable to in vivo gastric cancer model in mice. Tomivosertib is now in phase 2 clinical trials. Our study provides pre-clinical evidence to initialize clinical trials for gastric cancer using tomivosertib in combination with chemotherapy.","['tomivosertib inhibits gastric cancer via targeting mnk', 'tomivosertib preferentially sensitizes gastric cancer', 'preferentially sensitizes gastric cancer', 'vivo gastric cancer model', 'highly selective dual mnk1', 'chemotherapy via suppressing mnk', 'gastric cancer using tomivosertib', 'tomivosertib displays higher efficacy', 'inhibiting gastric cancer cells', 'phosphorylation coordinately regulate β', 'mnks regulate eif4e phosphorylation', 'phase 2 clinical trials', 'gastric cancer growth', 'tomivosertib significantly augments', 'initialize clinical trials', 'study provides pre', 'rescue studies confirm', 'potentially safe targets', 'gastric cancer', 'mnk inhibitors', 'normal cells', 'clinical evidence', '2 inhibitor', 'work reveals', 'vitro functional', 'various cancers', 'next show', 'mechanism observations', 'inhibitory effects', 'eif4e overexpression', 'eif4e contributes', 'aberrant activation', 'tomivosertib', 'tomivosertib', 'firstly demonstrate', 'catenin signaling', 'β', 'β', 'eif4e', 'eif4e', 'chemotherapy', 'chemotherapy', 'demonstrate', 'catenin', 'catenin', 'tumor', 'treatment', 'translatable', 'suggesting', 'resistance', 'potent', 'paclitaxel', 'mice', 'fu', 'finally', 'everolimus', 'combination', 'addition', 'activity', '5']"
"Beta-carotene is the most treasured provitamin A carotenoid molecule exhibiting antioxidant and coloring properties and significant applications in the food, pharmaceutical, and nutraceutical industries. β-carotene has many biological functions within the human frame; however, it is not synthesized within the human body, so its requirements are fulfilled via food and pharmaceuticals. Its manufacturing via chemical synthesis or extraction from plants offers low yields with excessive manufacturing expenses, which diverts the researchers towards microbial production of β-carotene. This alternative provides higher yield and low expenses and thus is more economical. Phaffia rhodozyma is a basidiomycetous yeast that is utilized to prevent cardiovascular diseases, cancer & to enhance immunity and anti-aging in medicine. This paper reviews the methods of production of β-carotene, biosynthesis of β-carotene from Phaffia rhodozyma, factors affecting β-carotene production during fermentation, and pharmacological properties of β-carotene.

"The microtubule-affinity regulating kinases (MARKs) family plays a crucial role in regulating breast cancer development and progression. However, its precise function and the relevant molecular mechanism in breast cancer have not yet been elucidated. In this study, analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data revealed that MARK2 expression was markedly upregulated in breast cancer tissues, and high expression of MARK2 was correlated with poor survival. Functional assays showed that MARK2 deletion or inhibition suppressed aerobic glycolysis and cell growth as well as induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, MARK2 stimulates mTOR-mediated hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α) transcription activity and represses p53-transcription activity in breast cancer cells. TCGA data revealed that MARK2 expression was positively correlated with mTOR, Raptor, S6K1, glucose transporter 1, lactate dehydrogenase, HIF-1α, and 4E-BP1 expression, whereas negatively correlated with p53, p21, and Bax in breast cancer tissue. Conclusively, our study demonstrated that MARK2 promotes breast cancer aerobic glycolysis and cell proliferation, and inhibits apoptosis, in part, through regulating mTOR/HIF-1α and p53 signaling pathways. Overall, these findings point to the potential of targeting MARK2 for breast cancer treatment.","['mark2 promotes breast cancer aerobic glycolysis', 'inhibition suppressed aerobic glycolysis', 'inducible factor 1 alpha', 'induced cell cycle arrest', 'regulating breast cancer development', 'breast cancer treatment', 'breast cancer tissues', 'breast cancer tissue', 'breast cancer cells', 'breast cancer cells', 'glucose transporter 1', 'cancer genome atlas', 'relevant molecular mechanism', 'functional assays showed', 'affinity regulating kinases', 'whereas negatively correlated', 'p53 signaling pathways', 'mark2 stimulates mtor', 'tcga data revealed', 'breast cancer', 'regulating mtor', 'data revealed', 'cell proliferation', 'cell growth', 'targeting mark2', 'mark2 expression', 'mark2 expression', 'mark2 deletion', 'transcription activity', 'transcription activity', 'represses p53', 'precise function', 'positively correlated', 'poor survival', 'mediated hypoxia', 'markedly upregulated', 'lactate dehydrogenase', 'high expression', 'findings point', 'family plays', 'crucial role', 'bp1 expression', 'study demonstrated', 'inhibits apoptosis', 'mark2', 'tcga', 'p53', 'mtor', 'correlated', 'study', 'apoptosis', 'yet', 'well', 's6k1', 'raptor', 'progression', 'potential', 'part', 'p21', 'overall', 'microtubule', 'mechanistically', 'marks', 'however', 'hif', 'hif', 'hif', 'elucidated', 'conclusively', 'bax', 'analysis', '4e', '1α', '1α', '1α']"
"Pathological fibrosis contributes to progression of various diseases, for which the therapeutic options are limited. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is one such progressive and fatal interstitial fibrotic disease that is often characterized by excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins leading to stiff lung tissue and impaired gas exchange. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying IPF progression remain largely unknown. In this study, we determined the role of Runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), an evolutionarily conserved transcription factor, in the differentiation of human lung fibroblasts (HLFs) in vitro and in an animal model of bleomycin (BLM)-induced lung fibrosis. We observed that the expression of RUNX1 was significantly increased in the lungs of BLM-injected mice as compared to saline-treated mice. Furthermore, HLFs stimulated with transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) showed significantly higher RUNX1 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, and compartmentalization in the nucleus. Inhibition of RUNX1 in HLFs (using siRNA) showed a significant reduction in the differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts as evidenced by reduced expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), TGF-β and ECM proteins such as fibronectin 1 (FN1), and collagen 1A1 (COL1A1). Mechanistic studies revealed that the increased expression of RUNX1 in TGF-β-stimulated lung fibroblasts is due to enhanced mRNA stability of RUNX1 through selective interaction with the RNA-binding profibrotic protein, human antigen R (HuR). Collectively, our data demonstrate that increased expression of RUNX1 augments processes involved in lung fibrosis including the differentiation of fibroblasts into collagen-synthesizing myofibroblasts. Our study suggests that targeting RUNX1 could limit the progression of organ fibrosis in diseases characterized by abnormal collagen deposition.","['molecular mechanisms underlying ipf progression remain largely unknown', 'blm )- induced lung fibrosis', 'showed significantly higher runx1 expression', 'fatal interstitial fibrotic disease', 'evolutionarily conserved transcription factor', 'related transcription factor 1', 'targeting runx1 could limit', 'runx1 augments processes involved', 'transforming growth factor β', 'lung fibrosis including', 'stiff lung tissue', 'pathological fibrosis contributes', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'smooth muscle actin', 'mechanistic studies revealed', 'impaired gas exchange', 'human antigen r', 'binding profibrotic protein', 'human lung fibroblasts', 'enhanced mrna stability', 'abnormal collagen deposition', 'stimulated lung fibroblasts', 'sma ), tgf', 'significantly increased', 'organ fibrosis', 'fibronectin 1', 'runx1 ),', 'protein levels', 'ipf', 'reduced expression', 'increased expression', 'increased expression', 'fn1 ),', 'various diseases', 'using sirna', 'treated mice', 'therapeutic options', 'significant reduction', 'selective interaction', 'proteins leading', 'often characterized', 'injected mice', 'hur ).', 'extracellular matrix', 'excessive accumulation', 'diseases characterized', 'data demonstrate', 'collagen 1a1', 'col1a1 ).', 'animal model', 'hlfs stimulated', 'synthesizing myofibroblasts', 'study suggests', 'ecm proteins', 'progression', 'progression', 'showed', 'blm', 'expression', 'runx1', 'runx1', 'runx1', 'runx1', 'mrna', 'fibroblasts', 'fibroblasts', 'collagen', 'β', 'β', 'β', 'tgf', 'tgf', 'study', 'myofibroblasts', 'ecm', 'hlfs', 'hlfs', 'α', 'vitro', 'saline', 'runt', 'role', 'rna', 'progressive', 'one', 'observed', 'nucleus', 'lungs', 'limited', 'inhibition', 'however', 'furthermore', 'evidenced', 'due', 'differentiation', 'differentiation', 'differentiation', 'determined', 'compartmentalization', 'compared', 'collectively', 'bleomycin', 'alpha']"
"The incidence of cervical cancer is closely related to high risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV). Women in Jingzhou had relatively high susceptibility to HPV-51, whose ratio was 9.61% (456/4743) among HR-HPV positive samples and ranked the fifth in all analyzed HR-HPV types. In this study, variations and phylogenetic trees of HPV-51 E6-E7 and L1 sequences were analyzed by MEGA-X. The selective pressure was estimated using PAML. B cell epitope of L1 amino acid sequences and T cell epitope of E6 and E7 amino acid sequences were further predicted by ABCpred server and IEDB website, respectively. In the E6-E7 sequences 14 single nucleotide variants occurred, among which 4 were nonsynonymous variants and 10 were synonymous variants. A total of 41 single nucleotide variants were identified in the L1 sequences, including 10 nonsynonymous variants and 31 synonymous variants. All the isolates of both E6-E7 and L1 were classified into the A variant lineage. In HPV-51 E6-E7 and L1 sequences, no positively selected site was found. Two nonconservative substitutions, H119Y and N176S in L1, affected multiple hypothetical B cell epitopes. Three nonconservative substitutions, T86P, S100L in E6 and F29L in E7, affected multiple hypothetical T cell epitopes.

"To develop and test a novel vesicoamniotic shunt (VAS) to treat fetal lower urinary tract obstruction (LUTO), decrease dislodgement and optimize shunt deployment in-vitro.
VAS design objectives included: 1) robust and atraumatic fixation elements, 2) kink resistant conduit to adjust to fetal movement and growth, 3) one-way pressure valve to facilitate bladder cycling, and 4) echogenic deployment visualization aids. The force to dislodge the novel Vortex shunt was compared with existing commercially available shunts in a bench-top porcine bladder model. Sonographic echogenicity was evaluated with ultrasound-guided deployment, and the shunt valve pressure measured.
A prototype novel Vortex shunt was developed using braided nitinol ""umbrella-type"" ends with a kink-resistant stem incorporating an internal one-way valve. The peak force required to dislodge the Vortex shunt was significantly higher than commercially available shunts (p<0.01). Shunt deployment in the bench-top model was easily confirmed with ultrasound guidance and the brisk decompression of the inflated porcine bladder thereafter. In-vitro valve gauge pressure testing mirrored bladder pressures in human LUTO cases.
In-vitro testing shows that the Vortex shunt may improve deployment, sonographic visualization, kink resistance, and dynamic size adjustment.

"Wnt signaling is essential during animal development and regeneration, but also plays an important role in diseases such as cancer and diabetes. The canonical Wnt signaling pathway is one of the most conserved signaling cascades in the animal kingdom, with the T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) proteins the major mediators of Wnt/β-catenin-regulated gene expression. In comparison to invertebrates, vertebrates possess a high diversity of TCF/LEF family genes, implicating this as a possible key change to Wnt signaling at the evolutionary origin of vertebrates. However, the precise nature of this diversification is only poorly understood. The aim of this study is to clarify orthology, paralogy and isoform relationships within the TCF/LEF gene family within chordates via in silico comparative study of TCF/LEF gene structure, molecular phylogeny and gene synteny. Our results support the notion that the four TCF/LEF paralog subfamilies in jawed vertebrates (gnathostomes) evolved via the two rounds of whole-genome duplication that occurred during early vertebrate evolution. Importantly, gene structure comparisons and synteny analysis of jawless vertebrate (cyclostome) TCFs suggest that a TCF7L2-like form of gene structure is a close proxy for the ancestral vertebrate structure. In conclusion, we propose a detailed evolutionary path based on a new pre-whole-genome duplication vertebrate TCF gene model. This ancestor gene model highlights the chordate and vertebrate innovations of TCF/LEF gene structure, providing the foundation for understanding the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in vertebrate evolution.","['lef gene family within chordates via', 'genome duplication vertebrate tcf gene model', 'ancestor gene model highlights', 'detailed evolutionary path based', 'canonical wnt signaling pathway', 'lef family genes', 'isoform relationships within', 'regulated gene expression', 'lef gene structure', 'lef gene structure', 'gene structure comparisons', 'lef paralog subfamilies', 'possible key change', 'ancestral vertebrate structure', 'conserved signaling cascades', 'lymphoid enhancer factor', 'early vertebrate evolution', 'silico comparative study', 'genome duplication', 'gene structure', 'evolved via', 'gene synteny', 'vertebrate evolution', 'vertebrate innovations', 'jawless vertebrate', 'evolutionary origin', 'wnt signaling', 'wnt signaling', 'cell factor', 'catenin signaling', 'two rounds', 'tcfs suggest', 'synteny analysis', 'results support', 'precise nature', 'poorly understood', 'new pre', 'molecular phylogeny', 'major mediators', 'like form', 'high diversity', 'close proxy', 'clarify orthology', 'animal kingdom', 'animal development', 'also plays', 'four tcf', 'vertebrates possess', 'jawed vertebrates', 'important role', 'lef', 'wnt', 'wnt', 'study', 'tcf', 'tcf', 'tcf', 'tcf', 'tcf', 'vertebrates', 'role', 'catenin', 'β', 'β', 'whole', 'whole', 'understanding', 'tcf7l2', 'regeneration', 'providing', 'proteins', 'propose', 'paralogy', 'one', 'occurred', 'notion', 'invertebrates', 'importantly', 'implicating', 'however', 'gnathostomes', 'foundation', 'essential', 'diversification', 'diseases', 'diabetes', 'cyclostome', 'conclusion', 'comparison', 'chordate', 'cancer', 'aim']"

At enrollment into the Women's Health Initiative cohort in 1993-1998, this subset of women was free of HF, cancer, or the inability to walk one block, with self-reported information on walking pace and walking duration. Multivariable Cox regression was used to examine associations of walking pace (casual <2 mph [referent], average 2-3 mph, and fast >3 mph) with incident HF. We also examined the joint association of walking pace and duration with incident HF.
There were 1455 incident adjudicated acute decompensated HF hospitalization cases during a median of 16.9 years of follow-up. There was a strong inverse association between walking pace and overall risk of HF (HR = 0.73, 95% CI [0.65, 0.83] for average vs. casual walking; HR = 0.66, 95%CI [0.56, 0.78] for fast vs. casual walking). There were similar associations of walking pace with HFpEF (HR = 0.73, 95%CI [0.62, 0.86] average vs. casual; HR = 0.63, 95%CI [0.50, 0.80] for fast vs. casual) and with HFrEF (HR = 0.72, 95%CI [0.57, 0.91] for average vs. casual; HR = 0.74, 95%CI [0.54, 0.99] for fast vs. casual). The risk of HF associated with fast walking with less than 1 h/week walking duration was comparable with the risk of HF among casual and average walkers with more than 2 h/week walking duration.
Walking pace was inversely associated with risks of overall HF, HFpEF, and HFrEF in postmenopausal women. Whether interventions to increase the walking pace in older adults will reduce HF risk and whether fast pace will compensate for the short duration of walking warrants further study.","['1455 incident adjudicated acute decompensated hf hospitalization cases', 'referent ], average 2', 'walk one block', 'multivariable cox regression', 'health initiative cohort', 'strong inverse association', 'week walking duration', 'week walking duration', '183 postmenopausal women', 'reported walking pace', 'reduce hf risk', 'whether fast pace', 'hf among casual', 'casual walking ).', 'incident hf', 'incident hf', 'incident hf', '2 mph', '2 h', 'whether interventions', 'reported information', 'among 25', 'walking pace', 'walking pace', 'walking pace', 'walking pace', 'walking pace', 'walking pace', 'walking pace', 'walking pace', 'walking duration', 'average walkers', 'average vs', 'average vs', 'average vs', 'overall hf', 'hf subtypes', 'hf sub', 'hf associated', 'walking warrants', 'postmenopausal women', 'fast walking', 'casual ).', 'short duration', 'similar associations', 'older adults', 'joint association', 'inversely associated', 'heart failure', 'fast vs', 'fast vs', 'fast vs', 'examined associations', 'examine associations', 'ejection fractions', 'casual walking', 'also examined', '9 years', '79 years', '3 mph', '3 mph', '1 h', 'overall risk', 'ages 50', 'hf', 'hf', 'hf', 'duration', 'fast', 'association', 'women', 'women', 'casual', 'casual', 'casual', 'casual', 'risk', 'risk', 'risk', 'risk', '50', 'used', 'types', 'subset', 'study', 'self', 'self', 'risks', 'reduced', 'preserved', 'median', 'less', 'investigate', 'increase', 'inability', 'hr', 'hr', 'hr', 'hr', 'hr', 'hr', 'hfref', 'hfref', 'hfref', 'hfpef', 'hfpef', 'hfpef', 'free', 'follow', 'enrollment', 'compensate', 'comparable', 'ci', 'ci', 'ci', 'ci', 'ci', 'ci', 'cancer', '99', '95', '95', '95', '95', '95', '95', '91', '86', '83', '80', '78', '74', '73', '73', '72', '66', '65', '63', '62', '57', '56', '54', '1998', '1993', '16', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']"
"Neutropenia is a dose-related treatment-limiting and costly adverse event of pemetrexed. We postulate that individualized dosing reduces the incidence of neutropenia. The aims of this study were to 1) investigate the costs of pemetrexed-related neutropenia and 2) to determine the pharmacoeconomic benefits of individualized dosing of pemetrexed in terms of budget impact, yearly cost savings and reduction in severe neutropenia. Retrospective data on the treatment of ≥grade 3 neutropenia during pemetrexed-based chemotherapy were collected from three Dutch hospitals to determine the mean health care consumption during a neutropenic episode. Subsequently, Monte Carlo simulations were performed using a validated pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model to predict the neutropenia incidence during four cycles for standard dosing of pemetrexed and individualized dosing. The mean costs per neutropenia and the expected neutropenia incidence were combined to calculate the budget impact and cost savings. We found that the average costs per pemetrexed-associated neutropenic episode to be € 1,490. The neutropenia incidence for the standard and individualized pemetrexed dosing strategies were 12.7 and 9.9%, respectively. This resulted in total expected neutropenia-related costs of approximately € 3.0 million and €2.4 million, respectively. Taking the number of patients eligible for pemetrexed treatment into account, individualized dosing could result in saving €686,000 on a yearly basis in the Netherlands alone. Individualized dosing of pemetrexed can decrease the incidence of neutropenia and thus result in a significant decrease in neutropenia-related costs and decreased risk of hospitalization or even death while maintaining therapeutic exposure.","['mean health care consumption', '≥ grade 3 neutropenia', 'mean costs per neutropenia', 'individualized dosing could result', 'average costs per pemetrexed', 'individualized pemetrexed dosing strategies', 'three dutch hospitals', 'monte carlo simulations', 'maintaining therapeutic exposure', 'costly adverse event', 'approximately € 3', 'individualized dosing reduces', 'saving € 686', 'total expected neutropenia', 'associated neutropenic episode', 'yearly cost savings', '9 %, respectively', 'expected neutropenia incidence', 'individualized dosing', 'individualized dosing', 'individualized dosing', 'thus result', 'neutropenic episode', 'cost savings', 'related costs', 'related costs', 'yearly basis', 'standard dosing', 'severe neutropenia', 'related neutropenia', '€ 2', '€ 1', 'validated pharmacokinetic', 'retrospective data', 'pharmacoeconomic benefits', 'performed using', 'patients eligible', 'netherlands alone', 'four cycles', 'even death', 'decreased risk', 'budget impact', 'budget impact', 'based chemotherapy', '4 million', '0 million', 'neutropenia incidence', 'neutropenia incidence', 'related treatment', 'significant decrease', 'pemetrexed treatment', 'costs', 'neutropenia', 'neutropenia', 'neutropenia', 'neutropenia', 'respectively', '9', 'incidence', 'incidence', 'pemetrexed', 'pemetrexed', 'pemetrexed', 'pemetrexed', 'pemetrexed', 'pemetrexed', 'treatment', 'standard', 'decrease', '2', '1', 'terms', 'taking', 'subsequently', 'study', 'resulted', 'reduction', 'predict', 'postulate', 'pk', 'pharmacodynamic', 'pd', 'number', 'model', 'limiting', 'investigate', 'hospitalization', 'found', 'dose', 'determine', 'determine', 'combined', 'collected', 'calculate', 'aims', 'account', '7', '490', '12', '000']"
"Gastric cancer is among the most frequently occurring gastrointestinal malignancies with a high mortality rate worldwide. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are defined as core regulators in the occurrence and progression of multiple cancers, including gastric carcinoma. Mounting evidence has indicated that NR2F2-AS1 can inhibit several malignant tumors. However, the function and potential mechanism of NR2F2-AS1 remain unclear. In the current study, we found that NR2F2-AS1 was weakly expressed in gastric cancer cells in comparison with normal cells. The study has further disclosed that ectopic of NR2F2-AS1 repressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion and EMT whereas it promoted cell apoptosis in gastric carcinoma. Subsequently, our results confirmed that miR-320b was negatively regulated and that suppression of miR-320b alleviated the malignant behaviors of GC cells. More importantly, PDCD4 was a target of miR-320b. Mechanistically, NR2F2-AS1 modulated the expression level of PDCD4 by sponging miR-320b. Finally, rescue assays demonstrated that NR2F2-AS1 down-regulated PDCD4 expression to restrain the development of gastric cancer by competitively binding to miR-320b. On the whole, our study revealed the role of NR2F2-AS1/miR-320b/PDCD4 regulatory network in gastric cancer, suggesting NR2F2-AS1 may represent a novel therapeutic target for patients with gastric carcinoma.","['high mortality rate worldwide', 'frequently occurring gastrointestinal malignancies', 'inhibit several malignant tumors', 'as1 repressed cell proliferation', 'promoted cell apoptosis', 'rescue assays demonstrated', 'pdcd4 regulatory network', 'novel therapeutic target', 'as1 remain unclear', 'as1 may represent', 'including gastric carcinoma', 'regulated pdcd4 expression', 'gastric cancer cells', 'malignant behaviors', 'gastric carcinoma', 'gastric carcinoma', 'gastric cancer', 'gastric cancer', 'gastric cancer', 'negatively regulated', 'expression level', 'normal cells', 'gc cells', 'weakly expressed', 'results confirmed', 'potential mechanism', 'multiple cancers', 'mounting evidence', 'long non', 'emt whereas', 'core regulators', 'competitively binding', 'coding rnas', 'as1 modulated', 'study revealed', 'current study', 'sponging mir', '320b alleviated', 'suggesting nr2f2', 'target', 'pdcd4', 'pdcd4', 'as1', 'as1', 'as1', 'as1', 'study', 'mir', 'mir', 'mir', 'mir', 'mir', '320b', '320b', '320b', '320b', '320b', 'nr2f2', 'nr2f2', 'nr2f2', 'nr2f2', 'nr2f2', 'nr2f2', 'nr2f2', 'whole', 'suppression', 'subsequently', 'role', 'restrain', 'progression', 'patients', 'occurrence', 'migration', 'mechanistically', 'lncrnas', 'invasion', 'indicated', 'importantly', 'however', 'function', 'found', 'finally', 'ectopic', 'disclosed', 'development', 'defined', 'comparison', 'among']"
"Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells are widely used for vaccine production, however, the safety of MDCK cells needs to be considered seriously because of high tumorigenicity. Micro RNAs (miRNAs) that are involved in the tumorigenicity of MDCK cells have been never been reported.
To reveal the role of miRNA in the tumorigenic phenotype of MDCK cell line.
The miRNA expression profiles of two monoclonal MDCK cells (M09CL and M35CL) with low tumorigenicity and one MDCK cell line (M73P) with high tumorigenicity were characterized and investigated by using small RNA-seq technology.
A total of 5 known miRNAs and 5 novel miRNAs were highly expressed in M73P. In addition, 4 known miRNAs and 4 novel miRNAs were highly expressed in M09CL and M35CL. The target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs were significantly enriched in several biological processes, and the majority of these genes were involved in pathways in cancer and the MAPK signaling pathway. Through interaction analysis, 4 up-regulated miRNAs (cfa-miR-452, cfa-miR-8826, cfa-miR-224, and cfa-miR-2387) and their crucial target genes related to the tumor regulation network were identified. Results indicated these 4 miRNAs might play crucial roles in the tumorigenesis of MDCK cells.
Our findings, which were based on the functional prediction of miRNAs and target genes, suggested that miRNAs might influence the tumorigenicity of MDCK cells by regulating target genes. Moreover, the results provided important data for understanding the miRNA-mediated regulatory networks that control the tumorigenicities of MDCK cells.","['4 mirnas might play crucial roles', 'results provided important data', 'crucial target genes related', 'one mdck cell line', 'two monoclonal mdck cells', 'mirnas might influence', 'mdck cell line', '4 novel mirnas', '4 known mirnas', 'using small rna', 'tumor regulation network', 'several biological processes', 'mediated regulatory networks', 'mapk signaling pathway', 'darby canine kidney', '5 novel mirnas', '5 known mirnas', 'regulating target genes', 'differentially expressed mirnas', 'mdck cells needs', 'mirna expression profiles', 'target genes', 'target genes', 'results indicated', 'mdck cells', 'mdck cells', 'mdck cells', 'mdck cells', 'regulated mirnas', 'highly expressed', 'highly expressed', 'widely used', 'vaccine production', 'tumorigenic phenotype', 'significantly enriched', 'seq technology', 'micro rnas', 'interaction analysis', 'functional prediction', 'considered seriously', 'low tumorigenicity', 'high tumorigenicity', 'high tumorigenicity', '4', 'mirnas', 'mirnas', 'mdck', 'genes', 'cells', 'mirna', 'mirna', 'tumorigenicity', 'tumorigenicity', 'understanding', 'tumorigenicities', 'tumorigenesis', 'total', 'suggested', 'safety', 'role', 'reveal', 'reported', 'pathways', 'never', 'moreover', 'mir', 'mir', 'mir', 'mir', 'majority', 'madin', 'm73p', 'm73p', 'm35cl', 'm35cl', 'm09cl', 'm09cl', 'involved', 'involved', 'investigated', 'identified', 'however', 'findings', 'control', 'characterized', 'cfa', 'cfa', 'cfa', 'cfa', 'cancer', 'based', 'addition', '8826', '452', '2387', '224']"
"The two patterns of pathogenesis for pancreatic colloid carcinoma are reported; (1) progression from ordinary ductal adenocarcinoma, a subtype of invasive pancreatic ductal carcinoma, and (2) progression from papillary adenocarcinoma derived from intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) or mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN). Whether these two conditions are the same disease remains controversial. Case Report 1. An 81-year-old woman was evaluated for an increased carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) value (130 U/mL) detected at 4-year follow-up after distal pancreatectomy for IPMN. Based on the image findings, a local recurrence of IPMN was diagnosed, and the patient underwent a remnant total pancreatectomy. Histopathologic findings showed marked mucus production from the tumor, also noteworthy because mucous nodule formation occurs in more than 80% of tumor. Fibrosis around the mucous cavity was noted, and a low papillary lesion was found in part of the cyst wall, which was contiguous to a flat, basal area; its nucleus was enlarged and heterogeneous in size, which is considered to be a component of intraductal papillary mucinous (IPMC). Therefore, the patient was diagnosed with pancreatic colloid carcinoma derived from IPMN. Case report 2 a 71-year-old man was evaluated for jaundice. Based on the image findings, a diagnosis of pancreatic head cancer was made, and a substomach preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. Histologically, marked mucus production and floating cuboidal masses of atypical cells without mucinous nodules were seen. Mucinous nodule formation is observed in more than 80% of tumor, but there was no IPMN component, which led to the diagnosis of pancreatic colloid carcinoma. In conclusion, there might be two types of colloid carcinoma of the pancreas, and further study is needed to determine whether these diseases are truly the same or not.","['histopathologic findings showed marked mucus production', 'atypical cells without mucinous nodules', 'increased carbohydrate antigen 19', 'invasive pancreatic ductal carcinoma', 'mucous nodule formation occurs', 'intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm', 'marked mucus production', 'pancreatic colloid carcinoma derived', 'mucinous nodule formation', 'intraductal papillary mucinous', 'mucinous cystic neoplasm', 'papillary adenocarcinoma derived', 'pancreatic colloid carcinoma', 'pancreatic colloid carcinoma', 'ordinary ductal adenocarcinoma', 'pancreatic head cancer', 'low papillary lesion', 'substomach preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy', 'floating cuboidal masses', 'disease remains controversial', 'remnant total pancreatectomy', 'case report 2', 'case report 1', 'colloid carcinoma', 'image findings', 'image findings', 'mucous cavity', 'distal pancreatectomy', 'two types', 'two patterns', 'two conditions', 'old woman', 'old man', 'mcn ).', 'local recurrence', 'ipmc ).', 'fibrosis around', 'cyst wall', 'basal area', 'also noteworthy', '130 u', 'patient underwent', 'determine whether', 'year follow', 'ipmn component', '2', '1', 'whether', 'patient', 'component', 'year', 'year', 'ipmn', 'ipmn', 'ipmn', 'ipmn', 'value', 'tumor', 'tumor', 'tumor', 'truly', 'therefore', 'subtype', 'study', 'size', 'seen', 'reported', 'progression', 'progression', 'performed', 'pathogenesis', 'part', 'pancreas', 'observed', 'nucleus', 'noted', 'needed', 'ml', 'might', 'made', 'led', 'jaundice', 'histologically', 'heterogeneous', 'found', 'flat', 'evaluated', 'evaluated', 'enlarged', 'diseases', 'diagnosis', 'diagnosis', 'diagnosed', 'diagnosed', 'detected', 'contiguous', 'considered', 'conclusion', 'ca19', 'based', 'based', '9', '9', '81', '80', '80', '71', '4']"
"This was a secondary analysis of a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) among young adult (YA) survivors of cancer, which showed preliminary evidence for improving psychosocial outcomes. Secondary outcomes assessed were the feasibility of collecting biological data from YAs and preliminary effects of MBSR on markers of inflammation and cardiovascular function.
Participants were randomized to 8-week MBSR or a waitlist control condition. Participants provided whole blood spot samples for analysis of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6 as well as blood pressure data in-person at baseline and 16-week follow-up. Feasibility was assessed with rates of providing biological data. Linear mixed effects modeling was used to evaluate preliminary effects of MBSR on inflammatory markers and blood pressure over time.
Of 126 total participants enrolled, 77% provided biological data at baseline (n = 48/67 MBSR, n = 49/59 control). At 16 weeks, 97% of the 76 retained participants provided follow-up biological data (n = 34/35 MBSR, n = 40/41 control). Relative to the control group, MBSR was associated with decreased systolic blood pressure (p = 0.042, effect sizes (ES) = 0.45) and decreased diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.017, ES = 0.64). There were no changes in CRP or IL-6.
This was the first study to explore the feasibility of collecting biological data from YA survivors of cancer and assess preliminary effects of MBSR on inflammatory and cardiovascular markers in an RCT.

"Breast cancer patients with lymphatic metastasis suffer from poor prognoses. There is an urgent need for controlling lymph node metastasis, but it has proven challenging so far. Here, we implemented LASSO analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas database to identify genes related to lymph node metastasis and prognosis, and 15 genes were selected. We constructed a functional protein association network and univariate Cox regression to identify significant genes. The results showed that BAHD1 could be predictive of lymph node metastasis as well as prognosis. In vitro studies demonstrated that BAHD1 exerted appreciable effects on the proliferation, migration, and invasion capacity of breast cancer cells. Furthermore, downregulation of BAHD1 induced cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. Additionally, the mRNA levels of CCND1, CDK1 and YWHAZ were decreased upon BAHD1 silencing.

"Biogenic silver nanoparticles (bio-AgNPs) is one of the most fascinating nanomaterials used for several biomedical purposes. In the current study, we biosynthesized AgNPs (bio-AgNPs) using Arthrospira platensis (A-bio-AgNPs), Microcystis aeruginosa (M-bio-AgNPs), and Chlorella vulgaris (C-bio-AgNPs) active metabolites and evaluated their anticancer efficacy against breast cancer. The recovered bio-AgNPs were characterized using scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM).

The obtained results indicated the safety usage of bio-AgNPs at concentrations of 0.1 mg/ml on PBMCs cells and 1.5 mg/ml on the Albino mice. The bio-AgNPs displayed dose-dependent cytotoxic effects against HepG-2, CaCO-2, and MCF-7 cell lines by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and arresting the treated cells in G0/G1 and sub G0 phases. In addition, A-bio-AgNPs induced breast cancer cellular apoptosis by downregulating the expression of survivin, MMP7, TGF, and Bcl2 genes. Upon A-bio-AgNPs treatment, a significant reduction in tumor growth and prolonged survival rates were recorded in breast cancer BALB/c model. Furthermore, A-bio-AgNPs treatment significantly decreased the Ki-67 protein marker from 60% (in the untreated group) to 20% (in the treated group) and increased caspase-3 protein levels to 65% (in treated groups) comparing with 45% (in doxorubicin-treated groups).","['agnps induced breast cancer cellular apoptosis', 'inducing reactive oxygen species', 'agnps treatment significantly decreased', 'agnps ), microcystis aeruginosa', 'breast cancer balb', 'using arthrospira platensis', 'transmission electron microscopy', 'several biomedical purposes', 'prolonged survival rates', 'obtained results indicated', 'fascinating nanomaterials used', 'dependent cytotoxic effects', 'characterized using scanning', 'biogenic silver nanoparticles', '7 cell lines', '67 protein marker', '3 protein levels', 'agnps displayed dose', 'sub g0 phases', 'breast cancer', 'treated groups ).', 'agnps treatment', 'agnps ),', 'treated groups', 'tem ).', 'biosynthesized agnps', 'treated group', 'treated cells', 'untreated group', 'tumor growth', 'significant reduction', 'safety usage', 'safety profiles', 'pbmcs cells', 'pbmcs cells', 'increased caspase', 'current study', 'chlorella vulgaris', 'bcl2 genes', 'anticancer efficacy', 'albino mice', 'albino mice', 'active metabolites', '5 mg', 'c model', '1 mg', 'recovered bio', 'agnps', 'agnps', 'agnps', 'agnps', 'agnps', 'g0', 'c', '1', 'bio', 'bio', 'bio', 'bio', 'bio', 'bio', 'bio', 'bio', 'bio', 'bio', 'vivo', 'vitro', 'upon', 'tgf', 'survivin', 'sem', 'ros', 'recorded', 'one', 'monitored', 'mmp7', 'ml', 'ml', 'mcf', 'ki', 'hepg', 'g1', 'furthermore', 'expression', 'evaluated', 'doxorubicin', 'downregulating', 'concentrations', 'comparing', 'caco', 'arresting', 'addition', 'addition', '65', '60', '45', '20', '2', '2', '0']"
"The objective of the present study is evaluation of serum and hair levels of essential metals and metalloids in women with benign breast disease and breast cancer in order to define similar and distinct patterns that may mediate the link between these pathologies.

Of those, 103 patients had benign (fibrocystic) breast disease, 107 patients had breast cancer (stage II), and 100 women were healthy and with absence of breast pathology. Trace metal and metalloid levels in hair and serum were evaluated by inductively coupled argon plasma mass-spectrometry (ICP-MS). The data demonstrate that breast cancer patients were characterized by significantly higher hair Cr and V levels, as well as reduced Cu and Mn content as compared to both benign breast disease patients and controls. In contrast, serum Cu levels in women with breast cancer exceeded those in the controls and benign breast disease cases. Patients with both benign and malignant breast tumors were characterized by lower serum Mn levels as compared to the control values. Serum Cu/Zn and especially Cu/Mn were found to be significantly increased in cancer patients. Significantly reduced hair and serum Se levels were noted only in women with fibrocystic disease. Based on the analysis of two biosamples, it is proposed that malignant breast tumor development is associated with the reduction of systemic Mn and Zn levels, and a concomitant elevation of Cu concentrations.","['inductively coupled argon plasma mass', '310 adult women aged 20', 'malignant breast tumor development', 'significantly higher hair cr', 'benign breast disease cases', 'lower serum mn levels', 'benign breast disease patients', 'malignant breast tumors', 'stage ii ),', '80 years old', 'benign breast disease', 'breast cancer exceeded', 'significantly reduced hair', 'serum se levels', 'breast cancer patients', 'serum cu levels', 'breast disease', 'breast cancer', 'breast cancer', 'hair levels', 'significantly increased', 'breast pathology', 'cancer patients', 'reduced cu', 'v levels', 'metalloid levels', 'serum cu', 'fibrocystic disease', '107 patients', '103 patients', 'systemic mn', 'mn content', 'especially cu', 'cu concentrations', 'zn levels', 'two biosamples', 'trace metal', 'present study', 'present study', 'ms ).', 'may mediate', 'essential metals', 'distinct patterns', 'define similar', 'data demonstrate', 'control values', 'concomitant elevation', '100 women', 'benign', 'benign', 'hair', 'serum', 'serum', 'patients', 'mn', 'women', 'women', 'women', 'zn', 'fibrocystic', 'well', 'total', 'spectrometry', 'reduction', 'proposed', 'pathologies', 'order', 'objective', 'noted', 'metalloids', 'link', 'icp', 'healthy', 'found', 'evaluation', 'evaluated', 'enrolled', 'controls', 'controls', 'contrast', 'compared', 'compared', 'characterized', 'characterized', 'based', 'associated', 'analysis', 'absence']"

For in vitro experiments, T24 cells were stimulated with Andro (0-40 µmol/L) and 5637 cells were stimulated with Andro (0 to 80 µmol/L). Cell growth, migration, and infiltration were assessed using cell counting kit-8, colony formation, wound healing, and transwell assays. Apoptosis rate was examined using flow cytometry. In in vivo study, the antitumor effect of Andro (10 mg/kg) was evaluated by 5637 tumor-bearing mice, and levels of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT related-proteins were determined by immunoblotting.
Andro suppressed growth, migration, and infiltraion of bladder cancer cells (P⩽0.05 or P⩽0.01). Additionally, Andro induced intrinsic mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in bladder cancer cell lines. Furthermore, Andro inhibited bladder cancer growth in mice (P⩽0.01). The expression of p65, p-AKT were suppressed by Andro treatment in vitro and in vivo (P⩽0.05 or P⩽0.01).
Andrographolide inhibits proliferation and promotes apoptosis in bladder cancer cells by interfering with NF-κB and PI3K/AKT signaling in vitro and in vivo.","['tumor xenograft mouse model bearing 5637 cells', 'assessed using cell counting kit', 'andro inhibited bladder cancer growth', 'examined using flow cytometry', 'bladder cancer cell lines', 'bladder cancer cell lines', 'andro induced intrinsic mitochondria', 'bladder cancer cells', 'bladder cancer cells', '5637 tumor', 'p ⩽ 0', 'p ⩽ 0', 'p ⩽ 0', 'p ⩽ 0', 'p ⩽ 0', 'andrographolide inhibits proliferation', 'nuclear factor κb', 'andro suppressed growth', 'cell growth', '5637 cells', 'bearing mice', 't24 cells', 'andro treatment', 'wound healing', 'transwell assays', 'promotes apoptosis', 'phosphoinositide 3', 'dependent apoptosis', 'colony formation', 'apoptosis rate', 'antitumor effect', '80 µmol', '40 µmol', '10 mg', '01 ).', '01 ).', '01 ).', 'akt signaling', 'akt related', 'l ).', 'vivo study', 'vitro experiments', 'p', '0', '0', 'andro', 'andro', 'andro', 'andro', 'suppressed', 'andrographolide', 'κb', 'κb', 'akt', 'mice', 'l', 'vivo', 'vivo', 'vitro', 'vitro', 'stimulated', 'stimulated', 'proteins', 'pi3k', 'p65', 'nf', 'nf', 'migration', 'migration', 'levels', 'kinase', 'kg', 'interfering', 'influences', 'infiltration', 'infiltraion', 'immunoblotting', 'furthermore', 'expression', 'explore', 'evaluated', 'determined', 'additionally', '8', '05', '05']"
"The aim, as proof of concept, was to optimize niosomal formulations of tamoxifen in terms of size, morphology, encapsulation efficiency, and release kinetics for further treatment of the breast cancer (BC). Different assays were carried out to evaluate the pro-apoptotic and cytotoxicity impact of tamoxifen-loaded niosomes in two BC cells, MDA-MB-231 and SKBR3. In this study, tamoxifen was loaded in niosomes after optimization in the formulation. The formulation of niosomes supported maximized drug entrapment and minimized their size. The novel formulation showed improvement in storage stability, and after 60 days only, small changes in size, polydispersity index, and drug entrapment were observed. Besides, a pH-dependent release pattern of formulated niosomes displayed slow release at physiological pH (7.4) and a considerable increase of release at acidic pH (5.4), making them a promising candidate for drug delivery in the BC treatment. The cytotoxicity study exhibited high biocompatibility with MCF10A healthy cells, while remarkable inhibitory effects were observed after treatment of cancerous lines, MDA-MB-231, and SKBR3 cells. The IC50 values for the tamoxifen-loaded niosomes were significantly less than other groups. Moreover, treatment with drug-loaded niosomes significantly changed the gene expression pattern of BC cells. Statistically significant down-regulation of cyclin D, cyclin E, VEGFR-1, MMP-2, and MMP-9 genes and up-regulation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 were observed. These results were in correlation with cell cycle arrest, lessoned migration capacity, and increased caspase activity and apoptosis induction in cancerous cells. Optimization in the formulation of tamoxifen-loaded niosomes can make them a novel candidate for drug delivery in BC treatment.","['cytotoxicity study exhibited high biocompatibility', 'formulated niosomes displayed slow release', 'niosomes supported maximized drug entrapment', 'novel formulation showed improvement', 'loaded niosomes significantly changed', 'remarkable inhibitory effects', 'optimize niosomal formulations', 'lessoned migration capacity', 'gene expression pattern', 'cell cycle arrest', 'dependent release pattern', 'mcf10a healthy cells', '4 ), making', 'increased caspase activity', 'two bc cells', 'drug entrapment', 'cytotoxicity impact', 'loaded niosomes', 'loaded niosomes', 'loaded niosomes', 'significantly less', 'novel candidate', 'release kinetics', 'bc cells', 'drug delivery', 'drug delivery', 'cancerous cells', 'bc ).', 'storage stability', 'statistically significant', 'small changes', 'promising candidate', 'polydispersity index', 'ic50 values', 'encapsulation efficiency', 'different assays', 'considerable increase', 'cancerous lines', 'breast cancer', 'apoptosis induction', '60 days', 'skbr3 cells', 'physiological ph', 'acidic ph', 'bc treatment', 'bc treatment', 'cyclin e', '9 genes', 'study', 'niosomes', 'release', 'drug', 'loaded', '4', 'formulation', 'formulation', 'formulation', 'ph', 'caspase', 'caspase', 'skbr3', 'cyclin', '9', 'treatment', 'treatment', 'treatment', 'vegfr', 'terms', 'tamoxifen', 'tamoxifen', 'tamoxifen', 'tamoxifen', 'tamoxifen', 'size', 'size', 'size', 'results', 'regulation', 'regulation', 'proof', 'pro', 'optimization', 'optimization', 'observed', 'observed', 'observed', 'morphology', 'moreover', 'mmp', 'mmp', 'minimized', 'mda', 'mda', 'mb', 'mb', 'make', 'groups', 'evaluate', 'correlation', 'concept', 'carried', 'besides', 'apoptotic', 'aim', '7', '5', '3', '231', '231', '2', '1']"
"Lenvatinib and sorafenib are currently available to treat patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, since the clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of lenvatinib and sorafenib included only patients with Child-Pugh class A, little is known about the effectiveness of the treatments in patients with hepatic decompensation. We compared the effectiveness of lenvatinib and sorafenib in decompensated patients with unresectable HCC.
Consecutive patients who were classified as Child-Pugh class B or C and received lenvatinib or sorafenib as first-line systemic therapy for unresectable HCC between November 2018 and April 2020 at a tertiary referral center were included in this retrospective study. The primary outcome was overall survival (OS), and the secondary outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS), time-to-progression, best overall tumor response, and safety profiles.
Among 94 patients, 34 received lenvatinib and 60 received sorafenib. The median OS was 4.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.9-5.2): 4.2 months (95% CI, 2.9-5.3) for lenvatinib and 4.1 months (95% CI, 2.7-6.4) for sorafenib. The treatment regimen was not associated with significant improvement in OS after adjusting for covariables (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.92; 95% CI, 0.54-1.54; P = 0.74). The treatment regimen was not an independent predictor of PFS (lenvatinib vs. sorafenib; aHR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.48-1.24; P = 0.28). HRs were maintained even after balancing with the inverse probability treatment weighting method. Objective response rates were 11.8% and 6.7% in patients receiving lenvatinib and sorafenib, respectively (P = 0.45). Ten patients in both groups (five in the lenvatinib group and five in the sorafenib group) underwent dose modification due to adverse events, and significant difference was not observed between the treatment groups (P = 0.49).

"A variety of studies have shown rising trends in the occurrence of colorectal cancer in younger patients as opposed to falling trends among older patients aged 55 years or more. We hypothesized that the time trends of benign colonic precursor lesions would reveal similar patterns.
The present study was designed to test this hypothesis in a large nationwide sample of the US population undergoing colonoscopy in community-based endoscopy centers.
The Inform Diagnostics database is an electronic repository of histopathologic records of patients distributed throughout the USA. A cross-sectional study analyzed the detection rates of sessile serrated adenomas (SSA), hyperplastic polyps (HP), tubular adenomas (TA), traditional serrated adenomas (TSA), or adenocarcinomas (colorectal cancer, CRC) in 2,910,174 colonoscopies done 2008-2020.
During the 13-year time period, the rate of SSA showed a significant rise, both in patients younger and older than 55 years. HP and TA both showed a significant decline during the same time period. The trends of CRC in the older age group decreased significantly between 2008 (or its peak in 2012) and 2020. The trends of CRC in the younger age group increased significantly between 2008 and its peak in 2017.
The age-specific time trends of benign and malignant colonic neoplasia are characterized by dissimilar temporal patterns. Such dissimilarity could suggest that besides a set of shared risk factors that affect all types of colonic neoplasia alike, there is yet another set of environmental risk factors that specifically influence malignant transformation.","['benign colonic precursor lesions would reveal similar patterns', 'falling trends among older patients aged 55 years', 'older age group decreased significantly', 'younger age group increased significantly', 'ta ), traditional serrated adenomas', 'us population undergoing colonoscopy', 'specifically influence malignant transformation', 'ssa ), hyperplastic polyps', 'hp ), tubular adenomas', '174 colonoscopies done 2008', 'dissimilar temporal patterns', 'malignant colonic neoplasia', 'sessile serrated adenomas', 'colonic neoplasia alike', '55 years', 'patients distributed throughout', 'shown rising trends', 'shared risk factors', 'large nationwide sample', 'inform diagnostics database', 'environmental risk factors', 'dissimilarity could suggest', 'based endoscopy centers', 'specific time trends', 'sectional study analyzed', 'yet another set', 'year time period', 'younger patients', 'patients younger', 'tsa ),', 'time trends', 'time period', 'older', 'ssa showed', 'present study', 'benign', 'significant rise', 'significant decline', 'histopathologic records', 'electronic repository', 'detection rates', 'colorectal cancer', 'colorectal cancer', 'age', 'trends', 'trends', 'ta', 'hp', 'set', '2008', '2008', 'showed', 'variety', 'usa', 'types', 'test', 'studies', 'rate', 'peak', 'peak', 'opposed', 'occurrence', 'hypothesized', 'hypothesis', 'designed', 'cross', 'crc', 'crc', 'crc', 'community', 'characterized', 'besides', 'affect', 'adenocarcinomas', '910', '2020', '2020', '2017', '2012', '2', '13']"
"Standard total mesorectal resection has become an important treatment option for locally advanced or high-risk rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy. 15-27% of patients can achieve pathological complete response (PCR) after neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy (nCRT). However, the relationship between PCR and postoperative complications remains an important unsolved problem. The objective of this study was to determine whether PCR was associated with the rate of postoperative complications.
This meta-analysis was implemented following the recommendations from Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. We searched electronic literature by PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar. Major outcomes of interest included anastomotic leakage, surgical-site infection, reoperation, and any postoperative complications. Other outcomes comprised postoperative hemorrhage, ileus, and mortality.
Eleven thousand two hundred ninety patients in 9 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis revealed that patients with PCR did not have a higher risk of anastomotic leakage (OR = 1.22, 95% CI 0.92-1.62, p = 0.17), reoperation (OR = 1.13, 95% CI 0.93-1.37, p = 0.22), and any postoperative complications (OR = 1.02, 95% CI 0.91-1.15, p = 0.72) than patients with non-PCR. However, the meta-analysis showed that the PCR group was superior to the non-PCR group in terms of surgical-site infection (9.38% vs. 12.44%OR = 0.68, 95% CI 0.47-0.98; p = 0.04).

"An inverse association between physical activity and colorectal cancer (CRC) has been suggested. We aimed to assess the specific and combined effects of leisure-time and occupational physical activities on CRC risk among Japanese adults.
Using Cox proportional hazard models, we tested whether walking time, sports activity, body posture during work, and job type-or the combination of these variables-were associated with CRC incidence in a prospective cohort of 26,897 Japanese adults aged 40-79 years.
During a median 17-year follow-up (1990-2009) period, we ascertained 423 incident cases of CRC (267 colon and 156 rectum cancer). Time spent walking suggested a dose-response inverse relationship with CRC risk (p-trend = 0.051). Manual labor was associated with lower CRC risk when compared to office work with HRs (95% CIs) of 0.74 (0.56-0.97) for CRC and 0.68 (0.48-0.96) for colon cancer. Compared to sitting, moving during work tended to be inversely associated with rectal cancer risk, especially after censoring early incident cases within 3 years after baseline; HR (95% CI) = 0.63 (0.40-0.99). Combining walking and job type suggested mutual and synergistic benefits on the risk of colon cancer (p-interaction = 0.03).

"The molecular pathogenesis of solid tumour was first assessed in colorectal cancer (CRC). To date, ≤ 100 genes with somatic alterations have been found to inter-connectively promote neoplastic transformation through specific pathways. The process of colorectal carcinogenesis via genome landscape is reviewed on the basis of an adenoma-to-carcinoma sequence, as shown by serial histological and epidemiological observations.
The relevant literatures from PubMed (1980-2021) have been reviewed for this article.
The major routes of CRC development, chromosomal instability (CIN), microsatellite instability (MSI), and the serrated route either via CIN or MSI, proceed through the respective molecular pathway of colorectal carcinogenesis. Particular aspects of CRC carcinogenesis can also be determined by evaluating familial CRCs (FCRC) and genotype-phenotype correlations. Specific causative gene alterations still leave to be identified in several FCRCs. Otherwise, recently verified FCRC can be particularly notable, for example, EPCAM-associated Lynch syndrome, polymerase proofreading-associated polyposis, RNF43-associated polyposis syndrome or NTHL1 tumour syndrome, and hereditary mixed polyposis syndrome. The oncogenic landscape is described, including representative pathway genes, the three routes of carcinogenesis, familial CRCs, genotype-phenotype correlations, the identification of causative genes, and consensus molecular subtypes (CMS).
Whole genome research using multi-gene panels (MGPs) has facilitated high through-put detection of previously unidentified genes involved in colorectal carcinogenesis.

"Epidemiologic evidence for specific types and sources of dietary fat and individual fatty acid with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk remains inconclusive. We aimed to comprehensively examine the associations of intakes of specific types (saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and trans) and sources (animal, dairy, and vegetable) of dietary fat and individual fatty acid with CRC risk.
We prospectively followed 65,550 women from the Nurses' Health Study (1986-2014) and 45,684 men from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (1986-2014). Dietary intake was assessed every 4 years using food frequency questionnaires. Self-reported CRC cases were confirmed through medical record review. Time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) for intakes of dietary fats and fatty acids and CRC risk.
During 2,705,560 person-years of follow-up, 2726 incident CRC cases were confirmed. Intake of monounsaturated fat tended to be positively associated with the risk of CRC (HR comparing extreme quintiles 1.22; 95% CI 1.01, 1.47; p = 0.06 for trend). This positive association was mainly driven by monounsaturated fatty acids from animal sources (MUFA-As) (HR comparing extreme quintiles 1.23; 95% CI 1.02, 1.49; p = 0.02 for trend). The positive association between MUFA-As and CRC was attenuated after adjusting for red and processed meat consumption (HR comparing extreme quintiles 1.17; 95% CI 0.95, 1.44; p = 0.13 for trend). We did not find clear associations between other types and sources of dietary fat or individual fatty acid and CRC risk.
Higher intake of MUFA-As was associated with higher CRC risk.

"Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is increasingly being utilized for the resection of gastrointestinal cancers. National trends for perioperative and oncologic outcomes of MIS for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are unknown. We hypothesized that with increased use of MIS, the perioperative outcomes and survival for GIST are preserved.
The National Cancer Database (2010-2016) was utilized to assess perioperative and oncologic outcomes for GIST of the stomach and small bowel. Kaplan-Meier method and log rank test were used to compare survival outcomes.
Data from 8923 gastric and 3683 small bowel resections were analyzed. Over the study period, MIS became the prevalent modality for gastrectomies (2010: robotic: 2.4%, laparoscopic: 26.1%, open: 71.5% vs. 2016: robotic: 9.6%, laparoscopic: 48.8%, open: 41.6%; p < 0.001), with a smaller increase in enterectomies (2010: robotic: 1%, laparoscopic: 17.3%, open: 81.6% vs. 2016: robotic: 3.9%, laparoscopic: 27.2%, open: 68.9%; p < 0.001). Age and Charlson comorbidity index were similar among groups. MIS approaches were associated with fewer readmissions and lower 90 day mortality for gastrectomies and similar rates for enterectomies. MIS did not compromise patient survival even in patients who underwent neoadjuvant treatment or harbored tumors ≥ 10 cm.

"Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) mediate dissemination of solid tumors and can be an early sign of disease progression. Moreover, they show a great potential in terms of non-invasive, longitudinal monitoring of cancer patients. CTCs have been extensively studied in breast cancer (BC) and were shown to present a significant phenotypic plasticity connected with initiation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Apart from conferring malignant properties, EMT affects CTCs recovery rate, making a significant portion of CTCs from patients' samples undetected. Wider application of methods and markers designed to isolate and identify mesenchymal CTCs is required to expand our knowledge about the clinical impact of mesenchymal CTCs. Therefore, here we provide a comprehensive review of clinical significance of mesenchymal CTCs in BC together with statistical analysis of previously published data, in which we assessed the suitability of a number of methods/markers used for isolation of CTCs with different EMT phenotypes, both in in vitro spike-in tests with BC cell lines, as well as clinical samples.

"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in female. Until now, advanced breast cancer is still lack effective treatment strategies and reliable prognostic markers. In the present article, we introduced the physiologic and pathologic functions and regulation mechanisms of ZBTB28, a tumor suppressor gene, in breast cancer. ZBTB28 is frequently silenced in breast cancer due to promoter CpG methylation, and its expression is positively correlated with breast cancer patient survival. The antineoplastic effect of ZBTB28 in breast cancer was elucidated through a series of in vitro and in vivo measurements, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle, epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), and growth of xenografts. Furthermore, ZBTB28 can directly regulate IFNAR to activate interferon-stimulated genes and potentiate macrophage activation. Ectopic ZBTB28 expression in breast cancer cells was sufficient to downregulate CD24 and CD47 to promote phagocytosis of macrophages, demonstrating that ZBTB28 was beneficial for the combination treatment of anti-CD24 and anti-CD47. Collectively, our results reveal a mode of action of ZBTB28 as a tumor suppressor gene and suggest that ZBTB28 is an important regulator of macrophage phagocytosis in breast cancer, holding promise for the development of novel therapy strategies for breast cancer patients.","['still lack effective treatment strategies', 'breast cancer patient survival', 'novel therapy strategies', 'tumor suppressor gene', 'tumor suppressor gene', 'reliable prognostic markers', 'promoter cpg methylation', 'epithelial mesenchymal transition', 'directly regulate ifnar', 'potentiate macrophage activation', 'including cell proliferation', 'breast cancer patients', 'breast cancer due', 'breast cancer cells', 'advanced breast cancer', 'ectopic zbtb28 expression', 'combination treatment', 'breast cancer', 'breast cancer', 'breast cancer', 'breast cancer', 'cancer death', 'macrophage phagocytosis', 'cell cycle', 'vivo measurements', 'stimulated genes', 'results reveal', 'regulation mechanisms', 'promote phagocytosis', 'present article', 'positively correlated', 'pathologic functions', 'leading cause', 'important regulator', 'holding promise', 'frequently silenced', 'emt ),', 'antineoplastic effect', 'activate interferon', 'downregulate cd24', 'expression', 'cd24', 'zbtb28', 'zbtb28', 'zbtb28', 'zbtb28', 'zbtb28', 'zbtb28', 'zbtb28', 'xenografts', 'vitro', 'suggest', 'sufficient', 'series', 'physiologic', 'mode', 'macrophages', 'introduced', 'growth', 'furthermore', 'female', 'elucidated', 'development', 'demonstrating', 'collectively', 'cd47', 'cd47', 'beneficial', 'apoptosis', 'anti', 'anti', 'action']"
"In recent years, there has been a surge in the development of mHealth apps. Nevertheless, there are no scoping reviews that analyze the scientific peer-reviewed articles of these tools. This research systematically reviews the scientific literature published on health apps targeting children in peer-reviewed journals. It aims to answer four questions: what is the primary purpose of these apps; for what medical specialties and main topics were they developed; whom do they target; and how they were analyzed. The study followed PRISMA methodology, and the search process used the Web of Science Core Collection. The selected terms for the search were ""pediatr*"" and ""app."" The initial search resulted in 303 papers which, after applying filters, excluded 187 papers. In the end, 116 articles were deemed appropriate for addressing our research questions and were thoroughly reviewed. The primary purpose of pediatric health apps is to support clinical decision-making, patient education, and patient self-management. The most frequent topics covered are cancer, obesity, and asthma. Hematological oncology and endocrinology are the most frequent medical specialties addressed. The apps mainly target children, their caregivers, or both groups. Most of the apps were analyzed using observational studies, predominantly conducted in the USA, with an average participant sample size of 842. No analyses of development costs were found. These findings can be helpful for the development of future pediatric health apps. What is Known: • Health care has become increasingly digital due to digital health technologies, which have helped to expand the scope of health care. • Digital health technology can be used to improve the health of children. • The increasing availability of smartphones for children and families may enable the use of apps to deliver, promote, and sustain interventions which could lead to long-term improvements in health. What is New: • The most frequent topics covered were cancer, obesity, and asthma.

"Chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA) is one of the most common and distressing side effects of chemotherapy treatment. This study aims to assess the illness perceptions of female patients dealing with CIA, and their associations with demographic and clinical characteristics, coping strategies, and quality of life. The secondary aim was to compare the illness perceptions of patients with CIA with other samples, to help elucidate the specific perceptions of patients with CIA.
Forty female patients at risk of severe hair loss due to chemotherapy treatment were included at the oncological daycare unit of a teaching hospital in the Netherlands. Patients were asked to complete the Brief-Illness Perception Questionnaire (B-IPQ) and the Hair Quality of Life (Hair-QoL) questionnaire.
Illness perceptions indicated that although patients understood their hair loss, they lacked being able to make sense of managing it, negatively impacting patients' lives. Psychological quality of life was significantly correlated with the B-IPQ domains: consequences, degree of concern, and emotional response. Social quality of life was significantly correlated with psychological quality of life. Patients with CIA felt significantly less able to manage their hair loss, compared to patients with breast cancer and psoriatic arthritis.
As patients' beliefs of being able to manage their hair loss are important for adopting and maintaining adequate coping behaviors, additional effort of health care providers in fostering patients' sense of control is indicated, focusing on patients' strengths during and after chemotherapy treatment. In the context of developing interventions for patients with CIA, consequences, concern, and emotional response are the major dimensions that should be taken in account to help patients deal with hair loss.","['cia felt significantly less able', 'maintaining adequate coping behaviors', 'severe hair loss due', 'oncological daycare unit', 'health care providers', 'distressing side effects', 'negatively impacting patients', 'forty female patients', 'female patients dealing', 'although patients understood', 'illness perception questionnaire', 'help patients deal', 'illness perceptions indicated', 'significantly correlated', 'significantly correlated', 'coping strategies', 'illness perceptions', 'illness perceptions', 'hair loss', 'hair loss', 'hair loss', 'hair loss', 'help elucidate', 'specific perceptions', 'teaching hospital', 'study aims', 'secondary aim', 'psoriatic arthritis', 'major dimensions', 'induced alopecia', 'emotional response', 'emotional response', 'developing interventions', 'clinical characteristics', 'breast cancer', 'additional effort', 'hair quality', 'social quality', 'psychological quality', 'psychological quality', 'fostering patients', 'chemotherapy treatment', 'chemotherapy treatment', 'chemotherapy treatment', 'make sense', 'ipq domains', 'able', 'able', 'hair', 'questionnaire', 'indicated', 'quality', 'patients', 'patients', 'patients', 'patients', 'patients', 'patients', 'patients', 'patients', 'chemotherapy', 'cia', 'cia', 'cia', 'cia', 'cia', 'sense', 'ipq', 'taken', 'strengths', 'samples', 'risk', 'qol', 'one', 'netherlands', 'managing', 'manage', 'manage', 'lives', 'life', 'life', 'life', 'life', 'life', 'lacked', 'included', 'important', 'focusing', 'demographic', 'degree', 'control', 'context', 'consequences', 'consequences', 'concern', 'concern', 'complete', 'compared', 'compare', 'common', 'brief', 'beliefs', 'b', 'b', 'associations', 'assess', 'asked', 'adopting', 'account']"
"Senescence, the irreversible cell cycle arrest of damaged cells, is accompanied by a deleterious pro-inflammatory senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Senescence and the SASP are major factors in aging, cancer, and degenerative diseases, and interfere with the expansion of adult cells in vitro, yet little is known about how to counteract their induction and deleterious effects. Paracrine signals are increasingly recognized as important senescence triggers and understanding their regulation and mode of action may provide novel opportunities to reduce senescence-induced inflammation and improve cell-based therapies. Here, we show that the signalling protein WNT3A counteracts the induction of paracrine senescence in cultured human adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). We find that entry into senescence in a small subpopulation of MSCs triggers a secretome that causes a feed-forward signalling cascade that with increasing speed induces healthy cells into senescence. WNT signals interrupt this cascade by repressing cytokines that mediate this induction of senescence. Inhibition of those mediators by interference with NF-κB or interleukin 6 signalling reduced paracrine senescence in absence of WNT3A and promoted the expansion of MSCs. Our work reveals how WNT signals can antagonize senescence and has relevance not only for expansion of adult cells but can also provide new insights into senescence-associated inflammatory and degenerative diseases.","['cultured human adult mesenchymal stem cells', 'interleukin 6 signalling reduced paracrine senescence', 'action may provide novel opportunities', 'increasing speed induces healthy cells', 'also provide new insights', 'irreversible cell cycle arrest', 'signalling protein wnt3a counteracts', 'forward signalling cascade', 'associated secretory phenotype', 'wnt signals interrupt', 'important senescence triggers', 'adult cells', 'adult cells', 'paracrine signals', 'damaged cells', 'paracrine senescence', 'improve cell', 'wnt signals', 'associated inflammatory', 'mscs triggers', 'yet little', 'work reveals', 'small subpopulation', 'repressing cytokines', 'major factors', 'induced inflammation', 'increasingly recognized', 'deleterious pro', 'deleterious effects', 'degenerative diseases', 'degenerative diseases', 'based therapies', 'reduce senescence', 'inflammatory senescence', 'antagonize senescence', 'mscs ).', 'sasp ).', 'wnt3a', 'cascade', 'senescence', 'senescence', 'senescence', 'senescence', 'senescence', 'senescence', 'mscs', 'sasp', 'κb', 'vitro', 'understanding', 'show', 'secretome', 'relevance', 'regulation', 'promoted', 'nf', 'mode', 'mediators', 'mediate', 'known', 'interference', 'interfere', 'inhibition', 'induction', 'induction', 'induction', 'find', 'feed', 'expansion', 'expansion', 'expansion', 'entry', 'counteract', 'causes', 'cancer', 'aging', 'accompanied', 'absence']"

"We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of immediate lipofilling as a volume replacement technique in breast conservative surgery (BCS) in terms of the volume of fat graft resorption after radiotherapy, patient satisfaction, and oncological safety.
This was a prospective study that included female patients with breast cancer, with small- or medium-sized breasts. The patients underwent BCS followed by lipofilling into the deformed areas away from the tumor site that resulted from direct closure of the tumor cavity. They were followed up for early and late postoperative complications, including recurrence. Volumetric computed tomography was performed before and after radiotherapy to determine percentage fat resorption. Postoperative patient satisfaction was assessed using the Kyungpook National University Hospital Breast Reconstruction Satisfaction Questionnaire.
The study included 54 female patients with a mean age of 47.57 ± 9.26 years. The mean follow-up period was 31.02 ± 4.47 months. Local recurrence was observed in three patients (5.56%). The volume reduction of the injected fat graft ranged from 10.15% to 55.67%, with a mean of 29.27 ± 10.06%. Fifty-two patients (96.30%) reported postoperative satisfaction, and nine of them expressed satisfaction only after a second lipofilling session.
Immediate lipofilling as a volume replacement technique in BCS is a safe and simple technique without major complications. It has a locoregional recurrence rate similar to BCS alone, with an acceptable fat resorption percentage and high postoperative patient satisfaction.

"With the development of genome sequencing, the role of molecular targeted therapy in cancer is becoming increasingly important. However, genetic testing remains expensive, invasive, and time-consuming, and thus unavailable for all patients. Radiogenomics aims to correlate imaging characteristics with gene expression patterns, gene mutations, and other genome-related characteristics. Due to the noninvasive nature of medical imaging, the field of radiogenomics is rapidly developing and may serve as a substitute tool for genetic testing. In this article, we briefly summarise the current role of radiogenomics in predicting gene mutations in brain, lung, colorectal, breast, and kidney tumours. KEY POINTS: • The role of molecular targeted therapy in individual cancer-precision therapy is becoming increasingly important with the development of genetic testing. • Radiogenomics may provide accurate imaging biomarkers as a substitute for genetic testing. • While the field of radiogenomics holds great promise, there are still a number of limitations that need to be overcome.","['• radiogenomics may provide accurate imaging biomarkers', 'radiogenomics holds great promise', 'genetic testing remains expensive', 'correlate imaging characteristics', 'becoming increasingly important', 'becoming increasingly important', 'molecular targeted therapy', 'molecular targeted therapy', 'gene expression patterns', 'predicting gene mutations', 'may serve', 'medical imaging', 'gene mutations', 'radiogenomics aims', 'genetic testing', 'genetic testing', 'genetic testing', 'precision therapy', 'related characteristics', 'thus unavailable', 'rapidly developing', 'noninvasive nature', 'kidney tumours', 'key points', 'briefly summarise', 'substitute tool', 'individual cancer', 'genome sequencing', 'current role', '•', '•', 'radiogenomics', 'radiogenomics', 'substitute', 'genome', 'cancer', 'role', 'role', 'time', 'still', 'patients', 'overcome', 'number', 'need', 'lung', 'limitations', 'invasive', 'however', 'field', 'field', 'due', 'development', 'development', 'consuming', 'colorectal', 'breast', 'brain', 'article']"
"This study aimed to establish a reliable diagnostic scoring model for the preoperative prediction of microvascular invasion (MVI) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients based on gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and biochemical indicators.
This retrospective study included 129 patients with HCC at our hospital from 2014 to 2020. Based on the intratumoral and peritumoral features on Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI and biochemical indicators, a scoring model was developed for preoperative prediction of MVI, and examined for diagnostic efficacy according to postoperative pathological results. The scoring model was further externally validated in an independent cohort of 63 HCC patients.
Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify five parameters related to MVI, including maximum tumor diameter, peritumoral low intensity in the hepatobiliary phase, incomplete capsule, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and [alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (U/L) + gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) (U/L)] / lymphocyte count (× 10
The scoring model based on Gd-EOB-DTPA MRI and biochemical indicators provides a reliable tool for preoperative prediction of MVI in HCC patients.

The scenarios accounted for multiple biological and technical factors that greatly affect the denoising performance, including relative magnitude of batch effects, the extent of cell population imbalance, the complexity of cell group structures, the proportion and the similarity of nonoverlapping cell populations, dropout rates and variable library sizes. We used multiple quantitative metrics and visualization of low-dimensional cell embeddings to evaluate the performance on batch mixing while preserving the original cell group and gene structures. Based on our results, we specified technical or biological factors affecting the performance of each method and recommended proper methods in different scenarios. In addition, we highlighted one challenging scenario where most methods failed and resulted in overcorrection. Our studies not only provided a comprehensive guideline for selecting suitable noise reduction procedures but also pointed out unsolved issues in the field, especially the urgent need of developing metrics for assessing batch correction on imperceptible cell-type mixing.","['selecting suitable noise reduction procedures', 'highlighted one challenging scenario', 'seq noise reduction procedures', '55 scenarios using simulated', 'used multiple quantitative metrics', 'choosing appropriate procedures', 'variable library sizes', 'including relative magnitude', 'original cell group', 'nonoverlapping cell populations', 'dimensional cell embeddings', 'cell rna sequencing', 'cell population imbalance', 'unmask biological signals', 'cell group structures', 'recommended proper methods', 'biological factors affecting', 'remove technical effects', 'assessing batch correction', 'multiple biological', 'developing metrics', 'imperceptible cell', 'technical factors', 'batch effects', 'batch correction', 'scenarios accounted', 'gene structures', 'different scenarios', 'different scenarios', 'specified technical', 'methods failed', 'computational methods', 'batch mixing', 'urgent need', 'unsolved issues', 'type mixing', 'systematic biases', 'real datasets', 'processing single', 'greatly affect', 'dropout rates', 'critical steps', 'comprehensive guideline', 'also pointed', '28 scrna', 'denoising performance', 'seq', 'scrna', 'performance', 'performance', 'performance', 'visualization', 'study', 'studies', 'similarity', 'results', 'resulted', 'provided', 'proportion', 'preserving', 'overcorrection', 'number', 'normalization', 'method', 'low', 'interest', 'guidance', 'field', 'extent', 'evaluate', 'especially', 'developed', 'data', 'complexity', 'based', 'assessed', 'although', 'addition']"
"Enzymes have evolved to catalyze their precise reactions at the necessary rates, locations, and time to facilitate our development, to respond to a variety of insults and challenges, and to maintain a healthy, balanced state. Enzymes achieve this extraordinary feat through their unique kinetic parameters, myriad regulatory strategies, and their sensitivity to their surroundings, including substrate concentration and pH. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) highlights the extraordinary number of ways in which the finely tuned activities of enzymes can be disrupted, contributing to cancer development and progression often due to somatic and/or inherited genetic alterations. Rather than being limited to the domain of enzymologists, kinetic constants such as kcat, Km, and kcat/Km are highly informative parameters that can impact a cancer patient in tangible ways - these parameters can be used to sort tumor driver mutations from passenger mutations, to establish the pathways that cancer cells rely on to drive patients' tumors, to evaluate the selectivity and efficacy of anti-cancer drugs, to identify mechanisms of resistance to treatment, and more. In this review, we will discuss how changes in enzyme activity, primarily through somatic mutation, can lead to altered kinetic parameters, new activities, or changes in conformation and oligomerization. We will also address how changes in the tumor microenvironment can affect enzymatic activity, and briefly describe how enzymology, when combined with additional powerful tools, and can provide us with tremendous insight into the chemical and molecular mechanisms of cancer.","['sort tumor driver mutations', 'progression often due', 'myriad regulatory strategies', 'inherited genetic alterations', 'including substrate concentration', 'additional powerful tools', 'highly informative parameters', 'finely tuned activities', 'affect enzymatic activity', 'unique kinetic parameters', 'cancer genome atlas', 'cancer cells rely', 'altered kinetic parameters', 'tumor microenvironment', 'passenger mutations', 'kinetic constants', 'new activities', 'enzyme activity', 'cancer patient', 'cancer drugs', 'tremendous insight', 'provide us', 'precise reactions', 'necessary rates', 'molecular mechanisms', 'identify mechanisms', 'extraordinary number', 'extraordinary feat', 'drive patients', 'briefly describe', 'balanced state', 'also address', 'cancer development', 'tangible ways', 'somatic mutation', 'enzymes achieve', 'parameters', 'cancer', 'ways', 'somatic', 'development', 'enzymes', 'enzymes', 'variety', 'used', 'tumors', 'treatment', 'time', 'tcga', 'surroundings', 'sensitivity', 'selectivity', 'review', 'respond', 'resistance', 'rather', 'primarily', 'ph', 'pathways', 'oligomerization', 'maintain', 'locations', 'limited', 'lead', 'km', 'km', 'kcat', 'kcat', 'insults', 'impact', 'highlights', 'healthy', 'facilitate', 'evolved', 'evaluate', 'establish', 'enzymology', 'enzymologists', 'efficacy', 'domain', 'disrupted', 'discuss', 'contributing', 'conformation', 'combined', 'chemical', 'changes', 'changes', 'changes', 'challenges', 'catalyze', 'anti']"
"Individuals with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis or elevated liver enzymes have increased cardiovascular mortality but are often excluded from prevention trials. We investigated the effectiveness of fixed-dose combination therapy for the prevention of major cardiovascular events (MCVE) among individuals with and without presumed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (pNASH).
Two thousand four hundred participants over 50 were randomized into the intervention and control groups. Consent was obtained post-randomization. Consenting participants in the intervention group were given a pill containing aspirin, atorvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, and valsartan (polypill). Participants were followed for 5 years. Presumed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis was diagnosed by ultrasonography and elevated liver enzymes. The primary outcome was MCVE. ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01245608. Among the originally randomized population, 138 of 1249 in the intervention group (11.0%) and 137 of 1017 controls (13.5%) had MCVE during the 5-year follow-up [unadjusted risk ratio (RR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.66-1.03]. Of the 1508 participants who consented to additional measurements and treatment, 63 of 787 (8.0%) intervention group participants and 86 of 721 (11.9%) controls had MCVE (adjusted RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.44-0.83). Although the adjusted relative risk of MCVE in participants with pNASH (0.35, 95% CI 0.17-0.74) was under half that for participants without pNASH (0.73, 95% CI 0.49-1.00), the difference did not reach statistical significance. There was no change in liver enzymes in participants taking polypill but among those with pNASH, there was a significant decrease after 60 months of follow-up (intragroup -12.0 IU/L, 95% CI -14.2 to -9.6).
Among patients consenting to receive fixed-dose combination therapy, polypill is safe and effective for the prevention of MCVE, even among participants with fatty liver and increased liver enzymes.
Can a single daily fixed-dose combination pill of aspirin, atorvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide, and valsartan (polypill) provide protection against major cardiovascular events (MCVE) in the general population? Does this protection extend to individuals with fatty liver and increased liver enzymes?
We observed no significant decrease in MCVE in participants randomized to the polypill group. However, among participants who consented to receive polypill, there was a significant decrease in MCVE and all-cause mortality regardless of fatty liver or increased liver enzymes.
In people aged >50 years, the polypill appears safe, well tolerated, and might reduce the risk of MCVE. Fatty liver and increased liver enzymes do not affect the safety of the polypill.

"To date, there are no preoperative and quantitative dynamics in clinical practice that can reliably differentiate between a benign and malignant renal cell carcinoma (RCC). For monitoring different analytes in body fluids, more than 40 different molecular biomarkers have been identified, however, they are associated with limited clinical sensitivity and/or non-optimal specificity due to their leaky nature. Previous work on RCC demonstrated the miRNA15a to be reliable and novel biomarker with 98.1% specificity and 100% sensitivity. Despite the high potential of miRNA15a biomarker, its clinical application is considerably hampered by the insensitive nature of the detection methods and low concentration of biomarker in samples that is aggravated by the high level of contamination due to other solutes present in body fluids. In this work, a non-invasive quantitative approach is demonstrated to overcome such diagnostics issues through biotin-streptavidin binding and fluorescence active magnetic nanocarriers that ensured prompt isolation, enrichment and purification of the biomarker miRNA15a from urine. The study demonstrates that detectable low levels of these miRNAs through miRNA capturing nanocarriers can potentially function as advanced diagnostic markers for the non-invasive investigation and early detection of renal cancer.","['fluorescence active magnetic nanocarriers', '40 different molecular biomarkers', 'malignant renal cell carcinoma', 'monitoring different analytes', 'mirna capturing nanocarriers', 'ensured prompt isolation', 'advanced diagnostic markers', 'detectable low levels', 'invasive quantitative approach', 'optimal specificity due', 'limited clinical sensitivity', 'renal cancer', 'quantitative dynamics', 'low concentration', 'invasive investigation', 'contamination due', 'clinical practice', 'clinical application', 'study demonstrates', 'streptavidin binding', 'solutes present', 'reliably differentiate', 'rcc ).', 'potentially function', 'leaky nature', 'insensitive nature', 'high potential', 'high level', 'early detection', 'diagnostics issues', 'detection methods', 'considerably hampered', 'body fluids', 'body fluids', 'novel biomarker', 'rcc demonstrated', 'previous work', 'mirna15a biomarker', 'biomarker mirna15a', 'specificity', 'sensitivity', 'biomarker', 'mirna15a', 'work', 'demonstrated', 'urine', 'samples', 'reliable', 'purification', 'preoperative', 'overcome', 'non', 'non', 'non', 'mirnas', 'identified', 'however', 'enrichment', 'despite', 'date', 'biotin', 'benign', 'associated', 'aggravated', '98', '100', '1']"
"Oral cancer is a common malignant tumor in the maxillofacial region. Surgical resection is the preferred treatment, but the severe functional impairment after surgery forces us to look for noninvasive treatments. As a promising noninvasive treatment method, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has received widespread attention in the field of cancer therapy, but the inefficient uptake capacity of tumor cells and the damage repair mechanisms limit the actual therapeutic effect. The establishment of a targeted therapy function and autophagy inhibition strategy is considered to be an important way to further enhance the effect of PDT. Based on this, we developed the biomimetic nanomaterial PCN-CQ@CCM. The metal-organic framework material PCN-224 was used as a carrier to load the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) and it was coated onto the surface with isolated oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell membranes. Owing to the immune evasion and homologous targeting ability of the biomimetic functionalized surface, PCN-CQ@CCM can escape macrophage phagocytosis and homologously adhere to tumor cells, enhancing the retention and uptake of nanomaterials in the tumor microenvironment. After being activated with a 660 nm laser, the generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) triggered the apoptosis pathway, as assessed by mitochondrial damage, and the released CQ further aggravated the ROS lethal pathway by effectively inhibiting the protective autophagic flux. Therefore, PCN-CQ@CCM achieves the precise synergy of PDT and autophagy inhibition through the biomimetic homologous targeting method, and the highly effective tumor suppression effect expands the field of vision for the noninvasive diagnosis and treatment of oral cancer.","['highly effective tumor suppression effect expands', 'isolated oral squamous cell carcinoma', 'generated reactive oxygen species', 'damage repair mechanisms limit', 'biomimetic homologous targeting method', 'organic framework material pcn', 'promising noninvasive treatment method', 'homologous targeting ability', 'actual therapeutic effect', 'surgery forces us', 'severe functional impairment', 'received widespread attention', 'protective autophagic flux', 'escape macrophage phagocytosis', 'common malignant tumor', '660 nm laser', 'autophagy inhibitor chloroquine', 'biomimetic nanomaterial pcn', 'targeted therapy function', 'biomimetic functionalized surface', 'autophagy inhibition strategy', 'inefficient uptake capacity', 'ros lethal pathway', 'cell membranes', 'autophagy inhibition', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor cells', 'tumor cells', 'oral cancer', 'oral cancer', 'mitochondrial damage', 'noninvasive treatments', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'apoptosis pathway', 'preferred treatment', 'photodynamic therapy', 'cancer therapy', 'surgical resection', 'precise synergy', 'maxillofacial region', 'important way', 'immune evasion', 'homologously adhere', 'effectively inhibiting', 'coated onto', 'effect', 'ccm achieves', 'released cq', 'treatment', 'pcn', 'pcn', 'uptake', 'surface', 'ros', 'ccm', 'ccm', 'cq', 'cq', 'cq', 'cq', 'vision', 'used', 'triggered', 'therefore', 'retention', 'pdt', 'pdt', 'pdt', 'owing', 'oscc', 'nanomaterials', 'metal', 'look', 'load', 'field', 'field', 'establishment', 'enhancing', 'enhance', 'developed', 'considered', 'carrier', 'based', 'assessed', 'aggravated', 'activated', '224']"
"Prehabilitation is a clinical model that introduces components of rehabilitation to patients prior to undergoing intensive medical interventions, such as surgery, in order to optimize function and improve tolerability to the intervention. Cancer care introduces a continuum of sequential or concurrent intensive anti-neoplastic medical interventions that are known to be detrimental to a patient's function. Prehabilitation evidence has grown across several areas of oncology care delivery demonstrating that a multi-modal rehabilitative intervention, delivered prior to oncology-direct therapies, leads to better functional outcomes and improves important endpoints associated with surgery and cancer treatment. This commentary article provides a brief history of the emergence of prehabilitation in cancer care delivery, reviews the current evidence base and guidelines for prehabilitation, and offers insights for future implementation of this model as a standard in oncology care. A prehabilitation program is an optimal starting point for most patients undergoing anti-neoplastic therapy as it serves as a gateway to improving functional outcomes throughout the cancer continuum. Future research in prehabilitation should aim to reach beyond measuring functional outcomes and to explore the impact of this model on important disease treatment endpoints such as tumor response to oncology-directed treatment, impact on treatment-related toxicities, and disease progression.","['reach beyond measuring functional outcomes', 'improving functional outcomes throughout', 'improves important endpoints associated', 'grown across several areas', 'undergoing intensive medical interventions', 'important disease treatment endpoints', 'oncology care delivery demonstrating', 'better functional outcomes', 'neoplastic medical interventions', 'concurrent intensive anti', 'patients undergoing anti', 'optimal starting point', 'commentary article provides', 'cancer care delivery', 'current evidence base', 'modal rehabilitative intervention', 'cancer care introduces', 'oncology care', 'disease progression', 'cancer treatment', 'patients prior', 'neoplastic therapy', 'introduces components', 'directed treatment', 'tumor response', 'related toxicities', 'offers insights', 'improve tolerability', 'future research', 'future implementation', 'direct therapies', 'delivered prior', 'cancer continuum', 'brief history', 'prehabilitation evidence', 'optimize function', 'prehabilitation program', 'clinical model', 'treatment', 'oncology', 'oncology', 'intervention', 'function', 'continuum', 'prehabilitation', 'prehabilitation', 'prehabilitation', 'prehabilitation', 'model', 'model', 'surgery', 'surgery', 'standard', 'serves', 'sequential', 'reviews', 'rehabilitation', 'patient', 'order', 'multi', 'leads', 'known', 'impact', 'impact', 'guidelines', 'gateway', 'explore', 'emergence', 'detrimental', 'aim']"
"Discovered in a large-scale screening of natural plant chemicals, Taxol/paclitaxel and the taxane family of compounds are surprisingly successful anti-cancer drugs, used in treatment of the majority of solid tumors, and especially suitable for metastatic and recurrent cancer. Paclitaxel is often used in combination with platinum agents and is administrated in a dose dense regimen to treat recurrent cancer. The enthusiasm and clinical development were prompted by the discovery that Taxol binds beta-tubulins specifically found within microtubules and stabilizes the filaments, and consequently inhibits mitosis. However, questions on how paclitaxel suppresses cancer persist, as other specific mitotic inhibitors are impressive in pre-clinical studies but fail to achieve significant clinical activity. Thus, additional mechanisms, such as promoting mitotic catastrophe and impacting non-mitotic targets, have been proposed and studied. A good understanding of how paclitaxel, and additional new microtubule stabilizing agents, kill cancer cells will advance the clinical application of these common chemotherapeutic agents. A recent study provides a potential non-mitotic mechanism of paclitaxel action, that paclitaxel-induced rigid microtubules act to break malleable cancer nuclei into multiple micronuclei. Previous studies have established that cancer cells have a less sturdy, more pliable nuclear envelope due to the loss or reduction of lamin A/C proteins. Such changes in nuclear structure provide a selectivity for paclitaxel to break the nuclear membrane and kill cancer cells over non-neoplastic cells that have a sturdier nuclear envelope. The formation of multiple micronuclei appears to be an important aspect of paclitaxel in the killing of cancer cells, either by a mitotic or non-mitotic mechanism. Additionally, by binding to microtubule, paclitaxel is readily sequestered and concentrated within cells. This unique pharmacokinetic property allows the impact of paclitaxel on cells to persist for several days, even though the circulating drug level is much reduced following drug administration/infusion. The retention of paclitaxel within cells likely is another factor contributing to the efficacy of the drugs. Overall, the new understanding of Taxol/paclitaxel killing mechanism-rigid microtubule-induced multiple micronucleation-will likely provide new strategies to overcome drug resistance and for rational drug combination.","['tubulins specifically found within microtubules', 'much reduced following drug administration', 'additional new microtubule stabilizing agents', 'unique pharmacokinetic property allows', 'likely provide new strategies', 'induced rigid microtubules act', 'pliable nuclear envelope due', 'achieve significant clinical activity', 'break malleable cancer nuclei', 'paclitaxel within cells likely', 'paclitaxel suppresses cancer persist', 'sturdier nuclear envelope', 'overcome drug resistance', 'nuclear structure provide', 'concentrated within cells', 'circulating drug level', 'common chemotherapeutic agents', 'induced multiple micronucleation', 'surprisingly successful anti', 'recent study provides', 'natural plant chemicals', 'dose dense regimen', 'consequently inhibits mitosis', 'another factor contributing', 'rational drug combination', 'treat recurrent cancer', 'kill cancer cells', 'kill cancer cells', 'specific mitotic inhibitors', 'promoting mitotic catastrophe', 'multiple micronuclei appears', 'taxol binds beta', 'paclitaxel killing mechanism', 'rigid microtubule', 'new understanding', 'additional mechanisms', 'platinum agents', 'recurrent cancer', 'cancer cells', 'cancer cells', 'multiple micronuclei', 'nuclear membrane', 'neoplastic cells', 'mitotic mechanism', 'mitotic mechanism', 'clinical studies', 'clinical development', 'clinical application', 'cancer drugs', 'mitotic targets', 'taxane family', 'solid tumors', 'several days', 'scale screening', 'readily sequestered', 'previous studies', 'less sturdy', 'important aspect', 'good understanding', 'even though', 'especially suitable', 'c proteins', 'paclitaxel action', 'potential non', 'often used', 'impacting non', 'microtubule', 'persist', 'cells', 'break', 'mitotic', 'killing', 'combination', 'paclitaxel', 'paclitaxel', 'paclitaxel', 'paclitaxel', 'paclitaxel', 'paclitaxel', 'paclitaxel', 'paclitaxel', 'taxol', 'taxol', 'used', 'non', 'non', 'drugs', 'treatment', 'thus', 'studied', 'stabilizes', 'selectivity', 'retention', 'reduction', 'questions', 'proposed', 'prompted', 'pre', 'overall', 'metastatic', 'majority', 'loss', 'large', 'lamin', 'infusion', 'impressive', 'impact', 'however', 'formation', 'filaments', 'fail', 'established', 'enthusiasm', 'either', 'efficacy', 'discovery', 'discovered', 'compounds', 'changes', 'binding', 'advance', 'administrated', 'additionally']"

Assuming that oral health and general health are directly linked, emerging interactions between systemic and oral diseases are increasingly being researched. Common important risk factors have implications for economic, social, and moral determinants of health. Interdisciplinarity trained oral health professionals are needed to address the excessively high rates of inequities in oral health. The main reason that oral diseases are still a global health problem is related to mainly individual subjective high-risk approaches, which resulting in high costs and low effectiveness. A paradigm shift for a public health approach is needed at population level that integrates different health professionals who deal with NCDs. Oral care, like physical activity, is one of the most important lifestyle-related determinants of health.

"Inflammation is a driven force in modulating microbial communities, but little is known about the interplay between colonizing microorganisms and the immune response in periodontitis.

"Risk assessment and follow-up of oral potentially malignant disorders in patients with mild or moderate oral epithelial dysplasia is an ongoing challenge for improved oral cancer prevention. Part of the challenge is a lack of understanding of how observable features of such dysplasia, gathered as data by clinicians during follow-up, relate to underlying biological processes driving progression. Current research is at an exploratory phase where the precise questions to ask are not known. While traditional statistical and the newer machine learning and artificial intelligence methods are effective in well-defined problem spaces with large datasets, these are not the circumstances we face currently. We argue that the field is in need of exploratory methods that can better integrate clinical and scientific knowledge into analysis to iteratively generate viable hypotheses. In this perspective, we propose that visual analytics presents a set of methods well-suited to these needs. We illustrate how visual analytics excels at generating viable research hypotheses by describing our experiences using visual analytics to explore temporal shifts in the clinical presentation of epithelial dysplasia. Visual analytics complements existing methods and fulfills a critical and at-present neglected need in the formative stages of inquiry we are facing.","['underlying biological processes driving progression', 'visual analytics complements existing methods', 'oral potentially malignant disorders', 'iteratively generate viable hypotheses', 'improved oral cancer prevention', 'experiences using visual analytics', 'generating viable research hypotheses', 'moderate oral epithelial dysplasia', 'visual analytics presents', 'visual analytics excels', 'newer machine learning', 'explore temporal shifts', 'defined problem spaces', 'artificial intelligence methods', 'better integrate clinical', 'present neglected need', 'epithelial dysplasia', 'exploratory methods', 'current research', 'methods well', 'clinical presentation', 'traditional statistical', 'scientific knowledge', 'risk assessment', 'precise questions', 'observable features', 'large datasets', 'formative stages', 'face currently', 'exploratory phase', 'ongoing challenge', 'dysplasia', 'need', 'well', 'challenge', 'understanding', 'suited', 'set', 'relate', 'propose', 'perspective', 'patients', 'part', 'needs', 'mild', 'lack', 'known', 'inquiry', 'illustrate', 'gathered', 'fulfills', 'follow', 'follow', 'field', 'facing', 'effective', 'describing', 'data', 'critical', 'clinicians', 'circumstances', 'ask', 'argue', 'analysis']"
"Oral mucositis is a painful complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for which photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) is a safe and effective intervention. Extraoral delivery of PBMT has clinical advantages over intraoral delivery but requires additional dosimetric considerations due to the external tissue layers through which the light must propagate before reaching the oral mucosa. Additionally, to date there has been no dose modeling study, a task essential to developing a justified treatment protocol. We review here some of the complexities surrounding extraoral photobiomodulation therapy and offer that may help guide researchers toward an evidence-based treatment protocol for the prevention of oral mucositis.","['requires additional dosimetric considerations due', 'may help guide researchers toward', 'complexities surrounding extraoral photobiomodulation therapy', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'light must propagate', 'justified treatment protocol', 'external tissue layers', 'dose modeling study', 'based treatment protocol', 'photobiomodulation therapy', 'extraoral delivery', 'task essential', 'painful complication', 'oral mucositis', 'oral mucositis', 'oral mucosa', 'intraoral delivery', 'effective intervention', 'clinical advantages', 'safe', 'review', 'reaching', 'prevention', 'pbmt', 'pbmt', 'offer', 'evidence', 'developing', 'date', 'additionally']"
"The application of deep machine learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence, has become a growing area of interest in predictive medicine in recent years. The deep machine learning approach has been used to analyze imaging and radiomics and to develop models that have the potential to assist the clinicians to make an informed and guided decision that can assist to improve patient outcomes. Improved prognostication of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) will greatly benefit the clinical management of oral cancer patients. This review examines the recent development in the field of deep learning for OSCC prognostication. The search was carried out using five different databases-PubMed, Scopus, OvidMedline, Web of Science, and Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE). The search was carried time from inception until 15 May 2021. There were 34 studies that have used deep machine learning for the prognostication of OSCC. The majority of these studies used a convolutional neural network (CNN). This review showed that a range of novel imaging modalities such as computed tomography (or enhanced computed tomography) images and spectra data have shown significant applicability to improve OSCC outcomes. The average specificity, sensitivity, area under receiving operating characteristics curve [AUC]), and accuracy for studies that used spectra data were 0.97, 0.99, 0.96, and 96.6%, respectively. Conversely, the corresponding average values for these parameters for computed tomography images were 0.84, 0.81, 0.967, and 81.8%, respectively. Ethical concerns such as privacy and confidentiality, data and model bias, peer disagreement, responsibility gap, patient-clinician relationship, and patient autonomy have limited the widespread adoption of these models in daily clinical practices. The accumulated evidence indicates that deep machine learning models have great potential in the prognostication of OSCC. This approach offers a more generic model that requires less data engineering with improved accuracy.","['using five different databases', 'receiving operating characteristics curve', 'oral squamous cell carcinoma', 'requires less data engineering', 'deep machine learning approach', 'used deep machine learning', 'deep machine learning models', 'deep machine learning', 'oral cancer patients', 'shown significant applicability', 'convolutional neural network', 'accumulated evidence indicates', '8 %, respectively', '6 %, respectively', '15 may 2021', 'novel imaging modalities', 'daily clinical practices', 'corresponding average values', 'enhanced computed tomography', 'improve patient outcomes', 'improve oscc outcomes', 'used spectra data', 'computed tomography images', 'deep learning', 'computed tomography', 'spectra data', 'approach offers', 'clinical management', 'average specificity', 'analyze imaging', 'develop models', 'studies used', 'widespread adoption', 'review showed', 'review examines', 'responsibility gap', 'recent years', 'recent development', 'predictive medicine', 'peer disagreement', 'patient autonomy', 'model bias', 'ieee ).', 'guided decision', 'greatly benefit', 'generic model', 'ethical concerns', 'electronic engineers', 'cnn ).', 'clinician relationship', 'auc ]),', 'artificial intelligence', '34 studies', 'improved prognostication', 'improved accuracy', 'growing area', 'great potential', 'carried time', 'oscc prognostication', 'used', 'data', 'models', 'patient', 'images', 'studies', 'oscc', 'oscc', 'oscc', 'prognostication', 'prognostication', 'potential', 'carried', 'area', 'accuracy', 'web', 'subfield', 'sensitivity', 'search', 'search', 'scopus', 'science', 'range', 'radiomics', 'pubmed', 'privacy', 'parameters', 'ovidmedline', 'make', 'majority', 'limited', 'interest', 'institute', 'informed', 'inception', 'field', 'electrical', 'conversely', 'confidentiality', 'clinicians', 'become', 'assist', 'assist', 'application', '99', '97', '967', '96', '96', '84', '81', '81', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0', '0']"
"The role of the tumour microenvironement (TME) in cancer progression and resistance to therapies is now widely recognized. The most prominent non-immune cell type in the microenvironment of oral cancer (OSCC) is cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF). Although CAF are a poorly characterised and heterogenous cell population, those with an ""activated"" myofibroblastic phenotype have been shown to support OSCC progression, promoting growth, invasion and numerous other ""hallmarks of malignancy."" CAF also confer broad resistance to different types of therapy, including chemo/radiotherapy and EGFR inhibitors; consistent with this, CAF-rich OSCC are associated with poor prognosis. In recent years, much CAF research has focused on their immunological role in the tumour microenvironment, showing that CAF shield tumours from immune attack through multiple mechanisms, and particularly on their role in promoting resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors, an exciting development for the treatment of recurrent/metastatic oral cancer, but which fails in most patients. This review summarises our current understanding of CAF subtypes and function in OSCC and discusses the potential for targeting these cells therapeutically.","['caf also confer broad resistance', 'heterogenous cell population', 'much caf research', 'caf shield tumours', 'l1 checkpoint inhibitors', 'immune cell type', 'metastatic oral cancer', 'support oscc progression', 'promoting resistance', 'caf subtypes', 'caf ).', 'although caf', 'oral cancer', 'immune attack', 'egfr inhibitors', 'cancer progression', 'widely recognized', 'tumour microenvironement', 'review summarises', 'recent years', 'promoting growth', 'prominent non', 'poorly characterised', 'poor prognosis', 'myofibroblastic phenotype', 'multiple mechanisms', 'malignancy .""', 'including chemo', 'exciting development', 'different types', 'current understanding', 'cells therapeutically', 'rich oscc', 'tumour microenvironment', 'associated fibroblasts', 'immunological role', 'resistance', 'caf', 'cancer', 'oscc', 'oscc', 'microenvironment', 'associated', 'role', 'role', 'treatment', 'tme', 'therapy', 'therapies', 'targeting', 'shown', 'showing', 'recurrent', 'radiotherapy', 'potential', 'pd', 'pd', 'patients', 'particularly', 'numerous', 'invasion', 'hallmarks', 'function', 'focused', 'fails', 'discusses', 'consistent', 'anti', 'activated', '1']"
"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is currently one of the 10 most common malignancies worldwide, characterized by a biologically highly diverse group of tumors with non-specific biomarkers and poor prognosis. The incidence rate of HNSCC varies widely throughout the world, with an evident prevalence in developing countries such as those in Southeast Asia and Southern Africa. Tumor relapse and metastasis following traditional treatment remain major clinical problems in oral cancer management. Current evidence suggests that therapeutic resistance and metastasis of cancer are mainly driven by a unique subpopulation of tumor cells, termed cancer stem cells (CSCs), or cancer-initiating cells (CICs), which are characterized by their capacity for self-renewal, maintenance of stemness and increased tumorigenicity. Thus, more understanding of the molecular mechanisms of CSCs and their behavior may help in developing effective therapeutic interventions that inhibit tumor growth and progression. This review provides an overview of the main signaling cascades in CSCs that drive tumor repropagation and metastasis in oral cancer, with a focus on squamous cell carcinoma. Other oral non-SCC tumors, including melanoma and malignant salivary gland tumors, will also be considered. In addition, this review discusses some of the CSC-targeted therapeutic strategies that have been employed to combat disease progression, and the challenges of targeting CSCs, with the aim of improving the clinical outcomes for patients with oral malignancies. Targeting of CSCs in head and neck cancer (HNC) represents a promising approach to improve disease outcome. Some CSC-targeted therapies have already been proven to be successful in pre-clinical studies and they are now being tested in clinical trials, mainly in combination with conventional treatment regimens. However, some studies revealed that CSCs may not be the only players that control disease relapse and progression of HNC. Further, clinical research studying a combination of therapies targeted against head and neck CSCs may provide significant advances.","['metastasis following traditional treatment remain major clinical problems', 'neck cscs may provide significant advances', 'biologically highly diverse group', 'neck squamous cell carcinoma', 'hnscc varies widely throughout', 'malignant salivary gland tumors', 'developing effective therapeutic interventions', 'termed cancer stem cells', 'conventional treatment regimens', 'squamous cell carcinoma', 'behavior may help', 'clinical research studying', 'main signaling cascades', 'improve disease outcome', 'current evidence suggests', 'inhibit tumor growth', 'drive tumor repropagation', 'control disease relapse', 'common malignancies worldwide', 'targeted therapeutic strategies', 'combat disease progression', 'oral cancer management', 'neck cancer', 'cscs may', 'clinical trials', 'clinical studies', 'clinical outcomes', 'tumor cells', 'tumor relapse', 'therapeutic resistance', 'developing countries', 'oral malignancies', 'initiating cells', 'oral cancer', 'therapies targeted', 'targeted therapies', 'scc tumors', 'cscs ),', 'unique subpopulation', 'studies revealed', 'specific biomarkers', 'southern africa', 'southeast asia', 'review provides', 'review discusses', 'promising approach', 'poor prognosis', 'molecular mechanisms', 'increased tumorigenicity', 'including melanoma', 'incidence rate', 'evident prevalence', 'currently one', 'cics ),', 'oral non', 'targeting cscs', 'mainly driven', 'metastasis', 'metastasis', 'hnscc', 'tumors', 'cancer', 'cancer', 'cscs', 'cscs', 'cscs', 'progression', 'progression', 'targeting', 'non', 'mainly', 'world', 'understanding', 'thus', 'tested', 'successful', 'stemness', 'self', 'represents', 'renewal', 'proven', 'pre', 'players', 'patients', 'overview', 'maintenance', 'improving', 'however', 'hnc', 'hnc', 'head', 'head', 'head', 'focus', 'employed', 'csc', 'csc', 'considered', 'combination', 'combination', 'characterized', 'characterized', 'challenges', 'capacity', 'also', 'already', 'aim', 'addition', '10']"
"Head and neck cancer is the sixth leading cancer worldwide; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) accounts for more than 90% of incident cases. In the US, cases of HNSCC associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) have been growing in proportion amongst a younger demographic with superior outcomes to the same treatments, relative to cases associated with tobacco. Yet failures to improve the long-term prognosis of advanced HNSCC over the last three decades persist in part due to intrinsic and acquired mechanisms of resistance. Deregulation of the pathways to respond to stress, such as apoptosis and autophagy, often contributes to drug resistance and tumor progression. Here we review the stress-response pathways in drug response and resistance in HNSCC to explore strategies to overcome these resistance mechanisms. We focus on the mechanisms of resistance to current standard cares, such as chemotherapy (i.e., cisplatin), radiation, and cetuximab. Then, we discuss the strategies to overcome these resistances, including novel combinations and immunotherapy.","['e ., cisplatin ), radiation', 'last three decades persist', 'sixth leading cancer worldwide', 'neck squamous cell carcinoma', 'including novel combinations', 'current standard cares', 'neck cancer', 'younger demographic', 'yet failures', 'tumor progression', 'term prognosis', 'superior outcomes', 'proportion amongst', 'part due', 'often contributes', 'human papillomavirus', 'drug response', 'incident cases', 'cases associated', 'acquired mechanisms', 'response pathways', 'hnscc associated', 'explore strategies', 'advanced hnscc', 'drug resistance', 'resistance mechanisms', 'mechanisms', 'cases', 'strategies', 'pathways', 'hnscc', 'hnscc', 'resistance', 'resistance', 'resistance', 'us', 'treatments', 'tobacco', 'stress', 'stress', 'review', 'respond', 'resistances', 'relative', 'overcome', 'overcome', 'long', 'intrinsic', 'improve', 'immunotherapy', 'hpv', 'head', 'head', 'growing', 'focus', 'discuss', 'deregulation', 'chemotherapy', 'cetuximab', 'autophagy', 'apoptosis', 'accounts', '90']"
"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a group of common cancers characterized by a swift growth pattern, early metastasis, and dismal 5-year survival rates. Despite the recent advances in cancer management, the multimodality approach is not effective in eradicating HNSCC. Moreover, the clinical response to the antiangiogenic therapy remains considerably limited in HNSCC patients, suggesting that tumor perfusion can take place through other non-angiogenic pathways. Tumor cell-induced angiogenesis is one of the main hallmarks of cancer. However, at the end of the previous millennium, a new paradigm of tumor cell-associated neovascularization has been reported in human melanoma cells. This new phenomenon, which was named ""vasculogenic mimicry"" or ""vascular mimicry"" (VM), describes the ability of aggressively growing tumor cells to form perfusable, matrix-rich, vessel-like networks in 3-dimensional matrices ","['antiangiogenic therapy remains considerably limited', 'neck squamous cell carcinoma', 'aggressively growing tumor cells', 'human melanoma cells', 'year survival rates', 'vm ), describes', 'swift growth pattern', 'common cancers characterized', 'tumor cell', 'tumor cell', 'tumor perfusion', 'vasculogenic mimicry', 'vascular mimicry', 'take place', 'recent advances', 'previous millennium', 'new phenomenon', 'new paradigm', 'multimodality approach', 'main hallmarks', 'like networks', 'induced angiogenesis', 'form perfusable', 'early metastasis', 'dismal 5', 'dimensional matrices', 'clinical response', 'associated neovascularization', 'angiogenic pathways', 'hnscc patients', 'eradicating hnscc', 'cancer management', 'hnscc', 'cancer', 'vessel', 'suggesting', 'rich', 'reported', 'one', 'non', 'named', 'moreover', 'matrix', 'however', 'head', 'group', 'end', 'effective', 'despite', 'ability', '3']"
