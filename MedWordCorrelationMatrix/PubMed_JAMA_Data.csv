35143603,Effect of Intra-arterial Alteplase vs Placebo Following Successful Thrombectomy on Functional Outcomes in Patients With Large Vessel Occlusion Acute Ischemic Stroke: The CHOICE Randomized Clinical Trial.,[],JAMA,"It is estimated that only 27% of patients with acute ischemic stroke and large vessel occlusion who undergo successful reperfusion after mechanical thrombectomy are disability free at 90 days. An incomplete microcirculatory reperfusion might contribute to these suboptimal clinical benefits.
To investigate whether treatment with adjunct intra-arterial alteplase after thrombectomy improves outcomes following reperfusion.
Phase 2b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial performed from December 2018 through May 2021 in 7 stroke centers in Catalonia, Spain. The study included 121 patients with large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke treated with thrombectomy within 24 hours after stroke onset and with an expanded Treatment in Cerebral Ischemia angiographic score of 2b50 to 3.
Participants were randomized to receive intra-arterial alteplase (0.225 mg/kg; maximum dose, 22.5 mg) infused over 15 to 30 minutes (n = 61) or placebo (n = 52).
The primary outcome was the difference in proportion of patients achieving a score of 0 or 1 on the 90-day modified Rankin Scale (range, 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) in all patients treated as randomized. Safety outcomes included rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and death.
The study was terminated early for inability to maintain placebo availability and enrollment rate because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Of 1825 patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with thrombectomy at the 7 study sites, 748 (41%) patients fulfilled the angiographic criteria, 121 (7%) patients were randomized (mean age, 70.6 [SD, 13.7] years; 57 women [47%]), and 113 (6%) were treated as randomized. The proportion of participants with a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 or 1 at 90 days was 59.0% (36/61) with alteplase and 40.4% (21/52) with placebo (adjusted risk difference, 18.4%; 95% CI, 0.3%-36.4%; P = .047). The proportion of patients with symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 24 hours was 0% with alteplase and 3.8% with placebo (risk difference, -3.8%; 95% CI, -13.2% to 2.5%). Ninety-day mortality was 8% with alteplase and 15% with placebo (risk difference, -7.2%; 95% CI, -19.2% to 4.8%).
Among patients with large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke and successful reperfusion following thrombectomy, the use of adjunct intra-arterial alteplase compared with placebo resulted in a greater likelihood of excellent neurological outcome at 90 days. However, because of study limitations, these findings should be interpreted as preliminary and require replication.

35143601,Association of Recent Use of Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants With Intracranial Hemorrhage Among Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke Treated With Alteplase.,[],JAMA,"Current guidelines recommend against use of intravenous alteplase in patients with acute ischemic stroke who are taking non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs).
To evaluate the safety and functional outcomes of intravenous alteplase among patients who were taking NOACs prior to stroke and compare outcomes with patients who were not taking long-term anticoagulants.
A retrospective cohort study of 163 038 patients with acute ischemic stroke either taking NOACs or not taking anticoagulants prior to stroke and treated with intravenous alteplase within 4.5 hours of symptom onset at 1752 US hospitals participating in the Get With The Guidelines-Stroke program between April 2015 and March 2020, with complementary data from the Addressing Real-world Anticoagulant Management Issues in Stroke registry.
Prestroke treatment with NOACs within 7 days prior to alteplase treatment.
The primary outcome was symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurring within 36 hours after intravenous alteplase administration. There were 4 secondary safety outcomes, including inpatient mortality, and 7 secondary functional outcomes assessed at hospital discharge, including the proportion of patients discharged home.
Of 163 038 patients treated with intravenous alteplase (median age, 70 [IQR, 59 to 81] years; 49.1% women), 2207 (1.4%) were taking NOACs and 160 831 (98.6%) were not taking anticoagulants prior to their stroke. Patients taking NOACs were older (median age, 75 [IQR, 64 to 82] years vs 70 [IQR, 58 to 81] years for those not taking anticoagulants), had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities, and experienced more severe strokes (median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 10 [IQR, 5 to 17] vs 7 [IQR, 4 to 14]) (all standardized differences >10). The unadjusted rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was 3.7% (95% CI, 2.9% to 4.5%) for patients taking NOACs vs 3.2% (95% CI, 3.1% to 3.3%) for patients not taking anticoagulants. After adjusting for baseline clinical factors, the risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was not significantly different between groups (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.88 [95% CI, 0.70 to 1.10]; adjusted risk difference [RD], -0.51% [95% CI, -1.36% to 0.34%]). There were no significant differences in the secondary safety outcomes, including inpatient mortality (6.3% for patients taking NOACs vs 4.9% for patients not taking anticoagulants; adjusted OR, 0.84 [95% CI, 0.69 to 1.01]; adjusted RD, -1.20% [95% CI, -2.39% to -0%]). Of the secondary functional outcomes, 4 of 7 showed significant differences in favor of the NOAC group after adjustment, including the proportion of patients discharged home (45.9% vs 53.6% for patients not taking anticoagulants; adjusted OR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.06 to 1.29]; adjusted RD, 3.84% [95% CI, 1.46% to 6.22%]).
Among patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with intravenous alteplase, use of NOACs within the preceding 7 days, compared with no use of anticoagulants, was not associated with a significantly increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage.",,,,,10.1001/jama.2022.0948,2022-02-11,"[{'lastname': 'Kam', 'firstname': 'Wayneho', 'initials': 'W', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.'}, {'lastname': 'Holmes', 'firstname': 'DaJuanicia N', 'initials': 'DN', 'affiliation': 'Duke Clinical Research Institute, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.'}, {'lastname': 'Hernandez', 'firstname': 'Adrian F', 'initials': 'AF', 'affiliation': 'Duke Clinical Research Institute, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.\nDivision of Cardiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.'}, {'lastname': 'Saver', 'firstname': 'Jeffrey L', 'initials': 'JL', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of California, Los Angeles.'}, {'lastname': 'Fonarow', 'firstname': 'Gregg C', 'initials': 'GC', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cardiology, University of California, Los Angeles.'}, {'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'Eric E', 'initials': 'EE', 'affiliation': 'Department of Clinical Neurosciences and the Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.'}, {'lastname': 'Bhatt', 'firstname': 'Deepak L', 'initials': 'DL', 'affiliation': ""Brigham and Women's Hospital Heart and Vascular Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.""}, {'lastname': 'Schwamm', 'firstname': 'Lee H', 'initials': 'LH', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston.'}, {'lastname': 'Reeves', 'firstname': 'Mathew J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Michigan State University, East Lansing.'}, {'lastname': 'Matsouaka', 'firstname': 'Roland A', 'initials': 'RA', 'affiliation': 'Duke Clinical Research Institute, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.\nDepartment of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.'}, {'lastname': 'Khan', 'firstname': 'Yosef M', 'initials': 'YM', 'affiliation': 'Health Informatics and Analytics, Center for Health Metrics and Evaluation, American Heart Association, Dallas, Texas.'}, {'lastname': 'Unverdorben', 'firstname': 'Martin', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Daiichi Sankyo Inc, Basking Ridge, New Jersey.'}, {'lastname': 'Birmingham', 'firstname': 'Mary C', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Janssen Scientific Affairs LLC, Titusville, New Jersey.'}, {'lastname': 'Lyden', 'firstname': 'Patrick D', 'initials': 'PD', 'affiliation': 'Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute of the Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles.'}, {'lastname': 'Asimos', 'firstname': 'Andrew W', 'initials': 'AW', 'affiliation': 'Department of Emergency Medicine, Carolinas Medical Center, Charlotte, North Carolina.'}, {'lastname': 'Altschul', 'firstname': 'Dorothea', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Valley Hospital, Ridgewood, New Jersey.'}, {'lastname': 'Schoonover', 'firstname': 'Timothy L', 'initials': 'TL', 'affiliation': 'Dayton Center for Neurological Disorders, Centerville, Ohio.'}, {'lastname': 'Jumaa', 'firstname': 'Mouhammad A', 'initials': 'MA', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, ProMedica Toledo Hospital, University of Toledo, Toledo, Ohio.'}, {'lastname': 'Nomura', 'firstname': 'Jason T', 'initials': 'JT', 'affiliation': 'Department of Emergency Medicine, ChristianaCare, Newark, Delaware.'}, {'lastname': 'Suri', 'firstname': 'Muhammad Fareed K', 'initials': 'MFK', 'affiliation': 'CentraCare, St Cloud, Minnesota.'}, {'lastname': 'Moore', 'firstname': 'S Arthur', 'initials': 'SA', 'affiliation': 'Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center, Knoxville, Tennessee.'}, {'lastname': 'Lafranchise', 'firstname': 'Eugene F', 'initials': 'EF', 'affiliation': 'Ascension Saint Thomas Hospital, Nashville, Tennessee.'}, {'lastname': 'Olson', 'firstname': 'DaiWai', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas.'}, {'lastname': 'Peterson', 'firstname': 'Eric D', 'initials': 'ED', 'affiliation': 'Division of Cardiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas.'}, {'lastname': 'Xian', 'firstname': 'Ying', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'Department of Neurology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas.'}]"

35133415,Effect of Subcutaneous Tirzepatide vs Placebo Added to Titrated Insulin Glargine on Glycemic Control in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes: The SURPASS-5 Randomized Clinical Trial.,[],JAMA,"The effects of tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, as an addition to insulin glargine for treatment of type 2 diabetes have not been described.
To assess the efficacy and safety of tirzepatide added to insulin glargine in patients with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycemic control.
Randomized phase 3 clinical trial conducted at 45 medical research centers and hospitals in 8 countries (enrollment from August 30, 2019, to March 20, 2020; follow-up completed January 13, 2021) in 475 adults with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control while treated with once-daily insulin glargine with or without metformin.
Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive once-weekly subcutaneous injections of 5-mg (n = 116), 10-mg (n = 119), or 15-mg (n = 120) tirzepatide or volume-matched placebo (n = 120) over 40 weeks. Tirzepatide was initiated at 2.5 mg/week and escalated by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks until the assigned dose was achieved.
The primary end point was mean change from baseline in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at week 40. The 5 key secondary end points included mean change in body weight and percentage of patients achieving prespecified HbA1c levels.
Among 475 randomized participants (211 [44%] women; mean [SD] age, 60.6 [9.9] years; mean [SD] HbA1c, 8.31% [0.85%]), 451 (94.9%) completed the trial. Treatment was prematurely discontinued by 10% of participants in the 5-mg tirzepatide group, 12% in the 10-mg tirzepatide group, 18% in the 15-mg tirzepatide group, and 3% in the placebo group. At week 40, mean HbA1c change from baseline was -2.40% with 10-mg tirzepatide and -2.34% with 15-mg tirzepatide vs -0.86% with placebo (10 mg: difference vs placebo, -1.53% [97.5% CI, -1.80% to -1.27%]; 15 mg: difference vs placebo, -1.47% [97.5% CI, -1.75% to -1.20%]; P < .001 for both). Mean HbA1c change from baseline was -2.11% with 5-mg tirzepatide (difference vs placebo, -1.24% [95% CI, -1.48% to -1.01%]; P < .001]). Mean body weight change from baseline was -5.4 kg with 5-mg tirzepatide, -7.5 kg with 10-mg tirzepatide, -8.8 kg with 15-mg tirzepatide and 1.6 kg with placebo (5 mg: difference, -7.1 kg [95% CI, -8.7 to -5.4]; 10 mg: difference, -9.1 kg [95% CI, -10.7 to -7.5]; 15 mg: difference, -10.5 kg [95% CI, -12.1 to -8.8]; P < .001 for all). Higher percentages of patients treated with tirzepatide vs those treated with placebo had HbA1c less than 7% (85%-90% vs 34%; P < .001 for all). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events in the tirzepatide groups vs placebo group were diarrhea (12%-21% vs 10%) and nausea (13%-18% vs 3%).
Among patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control despite treatment with insulin glargine, the addition of subcutaneous tirzepatide, compared with placebo, to titrated insulin glargine resulted in statistically significant improvements in glycemic control after 40 weeks.

35133411,Treatment of Tobacco Smoking: A Review.,[],JAMA,"More deaths in the US are attributed to cigarette smoking each year than to any other preventable cause. Approximately 34 million people and an estimated 14% of adults in the US smoke cigarettes. If they stopped smoking, they could reduce their risk of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and potentially gain up to 10 years of life.
Tobacco smoking is a chronic disorder maintained by physical nicotine dependence and learned behaviors. Approximately 70% of people who smoke cigarettes want to quit smoking. However, individuals who attempt to quit smoking make an average of approximately 6 quit attempts before achieving long-term abstinence. Both behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy while using nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products, varenicline, or bupropion are effective treatments when used individually, but they are most effective when combined. In a meta-analysis including 19 488 people who smoked cigarettes, the combination of medication and behavioral counseling was associated with a quit rate of 15.2% over 6 months compared with a quit rate of 8.6% with brief advice or usual care. The EAGLES trial, a randomized double-blind clinical trial of 8144 people who smoked, directly compared the efficacy and safety of varenicline, bupropion, nicotine patch, and placebo and found a significantly higher 6-month quit rate for varenicline (21.8%) than for bupropion (16.2%) and the nicotine patch (15.7%). Each therapy was more effective than placebo (9.4%). Combining a nicotine patch with other NRT products is more effective than use of a single NRT product. Combining drugs with different mechanisms of action, such as varenicline and NRT, has increased quit rates in some studies compared with use of a single product. Brief or intensive behavioral support can be delivered effectively in person or by telephone, text messages, or the internet. The combination of a clinician's brief advice to quit and assistance to obtain tobacco cessation treatment is effective when routinely administered to tobacco users in virtually all health care settings.
Approximately 34 million people in the US smoke cigarettes and could potentially gain up to a decade of life expectancy by stopping smoking. First-line therapy should include both pharmacotherapy and behavioral support, with varenicline or combination NRT as preferred initial interventions.",,,,,10.1001/jama.2022.0395,2022-02-09,"[{'lastname': 'Rigotti', 'firstname': 'Nancy A', 'initials': 'NA', 'affiliation': 'Tobacco Research and Treatment Center, Mongan Institute, Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.\nHarvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.'}, {'lastname': 'Kruse', 'firstname': 'Gina R', 'initials': 'GR', 'affiliation': 'Tobacco Research and Treatment Center, Mongan Institute, Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston.\nHarvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.'}, {'lastname': 'Livingstone-Banks', 'firstname': 'Jonathan', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.'}, {'lastname': 'Hartmann-Boyce', 'firstname': 'Jamie', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom.'}]"

35129581,Association of SARS-CoV-2 Infection With Serious Maternal Morbidity and Mortality From Obstetric Complications.,[],JAMA,"It remains unknown whether SARS-CoV-2 infection specifically increases the risk of serious obstetric morbidity.
To evaluate the association of SARS-CoV-2 infection with serious maternal morbidity or mortality from common obstetric complications.
Retrospective cohort study of 14 104 pregnant and postpartum patients delivered between March 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020 (with final follow-up to February 11, 2021), at 17 US hospitals participating in the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Gestational Research Assessments of COVID-19 (GRAVID) Study. All patients with SARS-CoV-2 were included and compared with those without a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result who delivered on randomly selected dates over the same period.
SARS-CoV-2 infection was based on a positive nucleic acid or antigen test result. Secondary analyses further stratified those with SARS-CoV-2 infection by disease severity.
The primary outcome was a composite of maternal death or serious morbidity related to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, postpartum hemorrhage, or infection other than SARS-CoV-2. The main secondary outcome was cesarean birth.
Of the 14 104 included patients (mean age, 29.7 years), 2352 patients had SARS-CoV-2 infection and 11 752 did not have a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. Compared with those without a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, SARS-CoV-2 infection was significantly associated with the primary outcome (13.4% vs 9.2%; difference, 4.2% [95% CI, 2.8%-5.6%]; adjusted relative risk [aRR], 1.41 [95% CI, 1.23-1.61]). All 5 maternal deaths were in the SARS-CoV-2 group. SARS-CoV-2 infection was not significantly associated with cesarean birth (34.7% vs 32.4%; aRR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.99-1.11]). Compared with those without a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, moderate or higher COVID-19 severity (n = 586) was significantly associated with the primary outcome (26.1% vs 9.2%; difference, 16.9% [95% CI, 13.3%-20.4%]; aRR, 2.06 [95% CI, 1.73-2.46]) and the major secondary outcome of cesarean birth (45.4% vs 32.4%; difference, 12.8% [95% CI, 8.7%-16.8%]; aRR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.07-1.28]), but mild or asymptomatic infection (n = 1766) was not significantly associated with the primary outcome (9.2% vs 9.2%; difference, 0% [95% CI, -1.4% to 1.4%]; aRR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.94-1.32]) or cesarean birth (31.2% vs 32.4%; difference, -1.4% [95% CI, -3.6% to 0.8%]; aRR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.93-1.07]).

One of the most popular sources of information for patients on the internet is YouTube. This study aimed to examine the quality of videos about RAI treatment.
This cross-sectional study was performed by using videos in YouTube. The terms ""radyoaktif iyot tedavisi"" and ""radioactive iodine treatment"" were used to search related videos in June 2021. The quality of the videos was assessed by using the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmark criteria, the DISCERN scale, and the global quality scale (GQS).
Of the total 88 videos evaluated, 56 videos (30 in English, 26 in Turkish) were analyzed according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Seven (12.5%) videos were assigned to the high-quality group, 16 (28.58%) to the intermediate quality group, and 33 (58.92%) to the low quality group. The findings of this study showed that the most popular videos with the highest video power index (VPI) scores and the highest number of video likes and comments belonged to the intermediate quality group. Contrarily, popularity level, number of video likes, and number of video views were the lowest in the high-quality group. The analysis of video sources revealed that viewers most preferred non-physician-sourced videos, with average total views of 59307.80 [standard deviation (SD): 122554.13]. The most liked videos were non-physician-made videos, with average total likes of 424.35 (SD: 639.41). The mean VPI scores were the highest in non-physician-made videos, with 25.18 (SD: 25.69). The average JAMA (1.92, SD: 0.50), DISCERN (34.31, SD: 14.33), and GQS scores (2.61, SD: 0.99) were the highest in physician-made videos.
Although high-quality videos on YouTube may inform and encourage patients positively, unprofessional, incorrect, and incomplete information can be also uploaded on YouTube and may mislead patients.

35103767,Prevalence and Cumulative Risk of Familial Idiopathic Dilated Cardiomyopathy.,[],JAMA,"Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) aggregates in families, and early detection in at-risk family members can provide opportunity to initiate treatment prior to late-phase disease. Most studies have included only White patients, yet Black patients with DCM have higher risk of heart failure-related hospitalization and death.
To estimate the prevalence of familial DCM among DCM probands and the age-specific cumulative risk of DCM in first-degree relatives across race and ethnicity groups.
A family-based, cross-sectional study conducted by a multisite consortium of 25 US heart failure programs. Participants included patients with DCM (probands), defined as left ventricular systolic dysfunction and left ventricular enlargement after excluding usual clinical causes, and their first-degree relatives. Enrollment commenced June 7, 2016; proband and family member enrollment concluded March 15, 2020, and April 1, 2021, respectively.
The presence of DCM in a proband.
Familial DCM defined by DCM in at least 1 first-degree relative; expanded familial DCM defined by the presence of DCM or either left ventricular enlargement or left ventricular systolic dysfunction without known cause in at least 1 first-degree relative.
The study enrolled 1220 probands (median age, 52.8 years [IQR, 42.4-61.8]; 43.8% female; 43.1% Black and 8.3% Hispanic) and screened 1693 first-degree relatives for DCM. A median of 28% (IQR, 0%-60%) of living first-degree relatives were screened per family. The crude prevalence of familial DCM among probands was 11.6% overall. The model-based estimate of the prevalence of familial DCM among probands at a typical US advanced heart failure program if all living first-degree relatives were screened was 29.7% (95% CI, 23.5% to 36.0%) overall. The estimated prevalence of familial DCM was higher in Black probands than in White probands (difference, 11.3% [95% CI, 1.9% to 20.8%]) but did not differ significantly between Hispanic probands and non-Hispanic probands (difference, -1.4% [95% CI, -15.9% to 13.1%]). The estimated prevalence of expanded familial DCM was 56.9% (95% CI, 50.8% to 63.0%) overall. Based on age-specific disease status at enrollment, estimated cumulative risks in first-degree relatives at a typical US advanced heart failure program reached 19% (95% CI, 13% to 24%) by age 80 years for DCM and 33% (95% CI, 27% to 40%) for expanded DCM inclusive of partial phenotypes. The DCM hazard was higher in first-degree relatives of non-Hispanic Black probands than non-Hispanic White probands (hazard ratio, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.26 to 2.83]).
In a US cross-sectional study, there was substantial estimated prevalence of familial DCM among probands and modeled cumulative risk of DCM among their first-degree relatives.

35103766,Effect of Moderate Hypothermia vs Normothermia on 30-Day Mortality in Patients With Cardiogenic Shock Receiving Venoarterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,[],JAMA,"The optimal approach to the use of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) during cardiogenic shock is uncertain.
To determine whether early use of moderate hypothermia (33-34 °C) compared with strict normothermia (36-37 °C) improves mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock receiving venoarterial ECMO.
Randomized clinical trial of patients (who were eligible if they had been endotracheally intubated and were receiving venoarterial ECMO for cardiogenic shock for <6 hours) conducted in the intensive care units at 20 French cardiac shock care centers between October 2016 and July 2019. Of 786 eligible patients, 374 were randomized. Final follow-up occurred in November 2019.
Early moderate hypothermia (33-34 °C; n = 168) for 24 hours or strict normothermia (36-37 °C; n = 166).
The primary outcome was mortality at 30 days. There were 31 secondary outcomes including mortality at days 7, 60, and 180; a composite outcome of death, heart transplant, escalation to left ventricular assist device implantation, or stroke at days 30, 60, and 180; and days without requiring a ventilator or kidney replacement therapy at days 30, 60, and 180. Adverse events included rates of severe bleeding, sepsis, and number of units of packed red blood cells transfused during venoarterial ECMO.
Among the 374 patients who were randomized, 334 completed the trial (mean age, 58 [SD, 12] years; 24% women) and were included in the primary analysis. At 30 days, 71 patients (42%) in the moderate hypothermia group had died vs 84 patients (51%) in the normothermia group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.45 to 1.13], P = .15; risk difference, -8.3% [95% CI, -16.3% to -0.3%]). For the composite outcome of death, heart transplant, escalation to left ventricular assist device implantation, or stroke at day 30, the adjusted odds ratio was 0.61 (95% CI, 0.39 to 0.96; P = .03) for the moderate hypothermia group compared with the normothermia group and the risk difference was -11.5% (95% CI, -23.2% to 0.2%). Of the 31 secondary outcomes, 30 were inconclusive. The incidence of moderate or severe bleeding was 41% in the moderate hypothermia group vs 42% in the normothermia group. The incidence of infections was 52% in both groups. The incidence of bacteremia was 20% in the moderate hypothermia group vs 30% in the normothermia group.
In this randomized clinical trial involving patients with refractory cardiogenic shock treated with venoarterial ECMO, early application of moderate hypothermia for 24 hours did not significantly increase survival compared with normothermia. However, because the 95% CI was wide and included a potentially important effect size, these findings should be considered inconclusive.

35103762,Diagnosis and Management of Multiple Myeloma: A Review.,[],JAMA,"Multiple myeloma is a hematologic malignancy characterized by presence of abnormal clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow, with potential for uncontrolled growth causing destructive bone lesions, kidney injury, anemia, and hypercalcemia. Multiple myeloma is diagnosed in an estimated 34 920 people in the US and in approximately 588 161 people worldwide each year.
Among patients with multiple myeloma, approximately 73% have anemia, 79% have osteolytic bone disease, and 19% have acute kidney injury at the time of presentation. Evaluation of patients with possible multiple myeloma includes measurement of hemoglobin, serum creatinine, serum calcium, and serum free light chain levels; serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation; 24-hour urine protein electrophoresis; and full-body skeletal imaging with computed tomography, positron emission tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging. The Revised International Staging System combines data from the serum biomarkers β2 microglobulin, albumin, and lactate dehydrogenase in conjunction with malignant plasma cell genomic features found on fluorescence in situ hybridization-t(4;14), del(17p), and t(14;16)-to assess estimated progression-free survival and overall survival. At diagnosis, 28% of patients are classified as having Revised International Staging stage I multiple myeloma, and these patients have a median 5-year survival of 82%. Among all patients with multiple myeloma, standard first-line (induction) therapy consists of a combination of an injectable proteasome inhibitor (ie, bortezomib), an oral immunomodulatory agent (ie, lenalidomide), and dexamethasone and is associated with median progression-free survival of 41 months, compared with historical reports of 8.5 months without therapy. This induction therapy combined with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation followed by maintenance lenalidomide is standard of care for eligible patients.
Approximately 34 920 people in the US and 155 688 people worldwide are diagnosed with multiple myeloma each year. Induction therapy with an injectable proteasome inhibitor, an oral immunomodulatory agent and dexamethasone followed by treatment with autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and maintenance therapy with lenalidomide are among the treatments considered standard care for eligible patients.",,,,,10.1001/jama.2022.0003,2022-02-02,"[{'lastname': 'Cowan', 'firstname': 'Andrew J', 'initials': 'AJ', 'affiliation': 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle.\nClinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.\nSeattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, Washington.'}, {'lastname': 'Green', 'firstname': 'Damian J', 'initials': 'DJ', 'affiliation': 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle.\nClinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.\nSeattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, Washington.'}, {'lastname': 'Kwok', 'firstname': 'Mary', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, Washington.\nDivision of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle.'}, {'lastname': 'Lee', 'firstname': 'Sarah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle.\nClinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.\nSeattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, Washington.'}, {'lastname': 'Coffey', 'firstname': 'David G', 'initials': 'DG', 'affiliation': 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Health System, Miami, Florida.'}, {'lastname': 'Holmberg', 'firstname': 'Leona A', 'initials': 'LA', 'affiliation': 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle.\nClinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.\nSeattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, Washington.'}, {'lastname': 'Tuazon', 'firstname': 'Sherilyn', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.\nNow with Bristol Myers Squibb, Seattle, Washington.'}, {'lastname': 'Gopal', 'firstname': 'Ajay K', 'initials': 'AK', 'affiliation': 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle.\nClinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.\nSeattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, Washington.'}, {'lastname': 'Libby', 'firstname': 'Edward N', 'initials': 'EN', 'affiliation': 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle.\nClinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.\nSeattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, Washington.'}]"

Original research articles published in 
Of the 306 randomized controlled trials identified 248 (81.0%) met the inclusion criteria, with 128 (51.6%) of eligible RCT being cited The factors which increased the likelihood of a RCT being referenced, versus not being, were: if device or surgery was the intervention (aOR 3.60; 95% CI 1.85-7.00) and if the sample size of the trial was 500-999 (aOR 3.70 (1.39-9.82).

35085383,Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients With COVID-19-Associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Who Underwent Lung Transplant.,[],JAMA,"Lung transplantation is a potentially lifesaving treatment for patients who are critically ill due to COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but there is limited information about the long-term outcome.
To report the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients who had COVID-19-associated ARDS and underwent a lung transplant at a single US hospital.
Retrospective case series of 102 consecutive patients who underwent a lung transplant at Northwestern University Medical Center in Chicago, Illinois, between January 21, 2020, and September 30, 2021, including 30 patients who had COVID-19-associated ARDS. The date of final follow-up was November 15, 2021.
Lung transplant.
Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were collected and analyzed. Outcomes of lung transplant, including postoperative complications, intensive care unit and hospital length of stay, and survival, were recorded.
Among the 102 lung transplant recipients, 30 patients (median age, 53 years [range, 27 to 62]; 13 women [43%]) had COVID-19-associated ARDS and 72 patients (median age, 62 years [range, 22 to 74]; 32 women [44%]) had chronic end-stage lung disease without COVID-19. For lung transplant recipients with COVID-19 compared with those without COVID-19, the median lung allocation scores were 85.8 vs 46.7, the median time on the lung transplant waitlist was 11.5 vs 15 days, and preoperative venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was used in 56.7% vs 1.4%, respectively. During transplant, patients who had COVID-19-associated ARDS received transfusion of a median of 6.5 units of packed red blood cells vs 0 in those without COVID-19, 96.7% vs 62.5% underwent intraoperative venoarterial ECMO, and the median operative time was 8.5 vs 7.4 hours, respectively. Postoperatively, the rates of primary graft dysfunction (grades 1 to 3) within 72 hours were 70% in the COVID-19 cohort vs 20.8% in those without COVID-19, the median time receiving invasive mechanical ventilation was 6.5 vs 2.0 days, the median duration of intensive care unit stay was 18 vs 9 days, the median post-lung transplant hospitalization duration was 28.5 vs 16 days, and 13.3% vs 5.5% required permanent hemodialysis, respectively. None of the lung transplant recipients who had COVID-19-associated ARDS demonstrated antibody-mediated rejection compared with 12.5% in those without COVID-19. At follow-up, all 30 lung transplant recipients who had COVID-19-associated ARDS were alive (median follow-up, 351 days [IQR, 176-555] after transplant) vs 60 patients (83%) who were alive in the non-COVID-19 cohort (median follow-up, 488 days [IQR, 368-570] after lung transplant).
In this single-center case series of 102 consecutive patients who underwent a lung transplant between January 21, 2020, and September 30, 2021, survival was 100% in the 30 patients who had COVID-19-associated ARDS as of November 15, 2021.",,,,,10.1001/jama.2022.0204,2022-01-28,"[{'lastname': 'Kurihara', 'firstname': 'Chitaru', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Division of Thoracic Surgery, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.'}, {'lastname': 'Manerikar', 'firstname': 'Adwaiy', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Division of Thoracic Surgery, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.'}, {'lastname': 'Querrey', 'firstname': 'Melissa', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Division of Thoracic Surgery, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.'}, {'lastname': 'Felicelli', 'firstname': 'Christopher', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.'}, {'lastname': 'Yeldandi', 'firstname': 'Anjana', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Department of Pathology, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.'}, {'lastname': 'Garza-Castillon', 'firstname': 'Rafael', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Division of Thoracic Surgery, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.'}, {'lastname': 'Lung', 'firstname': 'Kalvin', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Division of Thoracic Surgery, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.'}, {'lastname': 'Kim', 'firstname': 'Samuel', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of Thoracic Surgery, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.'}, {'lastname': 'Ho', 'firstname': 'Bing', 'initials': 'B', 'affiliation': 'Division of Nephrology, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.'}, {'lastname': 'Tomic', 'firstname': 'Rade', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.'}, {'lastname': 'Arunachalam', 'firstname': 'Ambalavanan', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.'}, {'lastname': 'Budinger', 'firstname': 'G R Scott', 'initials': 'GRS', 'affiliation': 'Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.'}, {'lastname': 'Pesce', 'firstname': 'Lorenzo', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Division of Thoracic Surgery, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.'}, {'lastname': 'Bharat', 'firstname': 'Ankit', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Division of Thoracic Surgery, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.'}]"

35076666,Population-Based Penetrance of Deleterious Clinical Variants.,[],JAMA,"Population-based assessment of disease risk associated with gene variants informs clinical decisions and risk stratification approaches.
To evaluate the population-based disease risk of clinical variants in known disease predisposition genes.
This cohort study included 72 434 individuals with 37 780 clinical variants who were enrolled in the BioMe Biobank from 2007 onwards with follow-up until December 2020 and the UK Biobank from 2006 to 2010 with follow-up until June 2020. Participants had linked exome and electronic health record data, were older than 20 years, and were of diverse ancestral backgrounds.
Variants previously reported as pathogenic or predicted to cause a loss of protein function by bioinformatic algorithms (pathogenic/loss-of-function variants).
The primary outcome was the disease risk associated with clinical variants. The risk difference (RD) between the prevalence of disease in individuals with a variant allele (penetrance) vs in individuals with a normal allele was measured.
Among 72 434 study participants, 43 395 were from the UK Biobank (mean [SD] age, 57 [8.0] years; 24 065 [55%] women; 2948 [7%] non-European) and 29 039 were from the BioMe Biobank (mean [SD] age, 56 [16] years; 17 355 [60%] women; 19 663 [68%] non-European). Of 5360 pathogenic/loss-of-function variants, 4795 (89%) were associated with an RD less than or equal to 0.05. Mean penetrance was 6.9% (95% CI, 6.0%-7.8%) for pathogenic variants and 0.85% (95% CI, 0.76%-0.95%) for benign variants reported in ClinVar (difference, 6.0 [95% CI, 5.6-6.4] percentage points), with a median of 0% for both groups due to large numbers of nonpenetrant variants. Penetrance of pathogenic/loss-of-function variants for late-onset diseases was modified by age: mean penetrance was 10.3% (95% CI, 9.0%-11.6%) in individuals 70 years or older and 8.5% (95% CI, 7.9%-9.1%) in individuals 20 years or older (difference, 1.8 [95% CI, 0.40-3.3] percentage points). Penetrance of pathogenic/loss-of-function variants was heterogeneous even in known disease predisposition genes, including BRCA1 (mean [range], 38% [0%-100%]), BRCA2 (mean [range], 38% [0%-100%]), and PALB2 (mean [range], 26% [0%-100%]).
In 2 large biobank cohorts, the estimated penetrance of pathogenic/loss-of-function variants was variable but generally low. Further research of population-based penetrance is needed to refine variant interpretation and clinical evaluation of individuals with these variant alleles.",,,,,10.1001/jama.2021.23686,2022-01-26,"[{'lastname': 'Forrest', 'firstname': 'Iain S', 'initials': 'IS', 'affiliation': 'The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.\nMedical Scientist Training Program, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.\nThe Bio Me Phenomics Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.\nDepartment of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.'}, {'lastname': 'Chaudhary', 'firstname': 'Kumardeep', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.\nThe Bio Me Phenomics Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.\nDepartment of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.\nThe Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.'}, {'lastname': 'Vy', 'firstname': 'Ha My T', 'initials': 'HMT', 'affiliation': 'The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.\nDepartment of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.'}, {'lastname': 'Petrazzini', 'firstname': 'Ben O', 'initials': 'BO', 'affiliation': 'The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.\nDepartment of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.'}, {'lastname': 'Bafna', 'firstname': 'Shantanu', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.\nDepartment of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.'}, {'lastname': 'Jordan', 'firstname': 'Daniel M', 'initials': 'DM', 'affiliation': 'The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.\nDepartment of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.'}, {'lastname': 'Rocheleau', 'firstname': 'Ghislain', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.\nDepartment of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.'}, {'lastname': 'Loos', 'firstname': 'Ruth J F', 'initials': 'RJF', 'affiliation': 'The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.\nDepartment of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.\nThe Mindich Child Health and Development Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.'}, {'lastname': 'Nadkarni', 'firstname': 'Girish N', 'initials': 'GN', 'affiliation': 'The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.\nThe Bio Me Phenomics Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.\nThe Hasso Plattner Institute for Digital Health at Mount Sinai, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.\nDepartment of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.'}, {'lastname': 'Cho', 'firstname': 'Judy H', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.\nThe Bio Me Phenomics Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.\nDepartment of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.\nDepartment of Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.'}, {'lastname': 'Do', 'firstname': 'Ron', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.\nThe Bio Me Phenomics Center, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.\nDepartment of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.'}]"
35076665,Myocarditis Cases Reported After mRNA-Based COVID-19 Vaccination in the US From December 2020 to August 2021.,[],JAMA,"Vaccination against COVID-19 provides clear public health benefits, but vaccination also carries potential risks. The risks and outcomes of myocarditis after COVID-19 vaccination are unclear.
To describe reports of myocarditis and the reporting rates after mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccination in the US.
Descriptive study of reports of myocarditis to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) that occurred after mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine administration between December 2020 and August 2021 in 192 405 448 individuals older than 12 years of age in the US; data were processed by VAERS as of September 30, 2021.
Vaccination with BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) or mRNA-1273 (Moderna).
Reports of myocarditis to VAERS were adjudicated and summarized for all age groups. Crude reporting rates were calculated across age and sex strata. Expected rates of myocarditis by age and sex were calculated using 2017-2019 claims data. For persons younger than 30 years of age, medical record reviews and clinician interviews were conducted to describe clinical presentation, diagnostic test results, treatment, and early outcomes.
Among 192 405 448 persons receiving a total of 354 100 845 mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines during the study period, there were 1991 reports of myocarditis to VAERS and 1626 of these reports met the case definition of myocarditis. Of those with myocarditis, the median age was 21 years (IQR, 16-31 years) and the median time to symptom onset was 2 days (IQR, 1-3 days). Males comprised 82% of the myocarditis cases for whom sex was reported. The crude reporting rates for cases of myocarditis within 7 days after COVID-19 vaccination exceeded the expected rates of myocarditis across multiple age and sex strata. The rates of myocarditis were highest after the second vaccination dose in adolescent males aged 12 to 15 years (70.7 per million doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine), in adolescent males aged 16 to 17 years (105.9 per million doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine), and in young men aged 18 to 24 years (52.4 and 56.3 per million doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine and the mRNA-1273 vaccine, respectively). There were 826 cases of myocarditis among those younger than 30 years of age who had detailed clinical information available; of these cases, 792 of 809 (98%) had elevated troponin levels, 569 of 794 (72%) had abnormal electrocardiogram results, and 223 of 312 (72%) had abnormal cardiac magnetic resonance imaging results. Approximately 96% of persons (784/813) were hospitalized and 87% (577/661) of these had resolution of presenting symptoms by hospital discharge. The most common treatment was nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (589/676; 87%).
Based on passive surveillance reporting in the US, the risk of myocarditis after receiving mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines was increased across multiple age and sex strata and was highest after the second vaccination dose in adolescent males and young men. This risk should be considered in the context of the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination.",,,,,10.1001/jama.2021.24110,2022-01-26,"[{'lastname': 'Oster', 'firstname': 'Matthew E', 'initials': 'ME', 'affiliation': ""US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.\nSchool of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.\nChildren's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia.""}, {'lastname': 'Shay', 'firstname': 'David K', 'initials': 'DK', 'affiliation': 'US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.'}, {'lastname': 'Su', 'firstname': 'John R', 'initials': 'JR', 'affiliation': 'US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.'}, {'lastname': 'Gee', 'firstname': 'Julianne', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.'}, {'lastname': 'Creech', 'firstname': 'C Buddy', 'initials': 'CB', 'affiliation': 'Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.'}, {'lastname': 'Broder', 'firstname': 'Karen R', 'initials': 'KR', 'affiliation': 'US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.'}, {'lastname': 'Edwards', 'firstname': 'Kathryn', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.'}, {'lastname': 'Soslow', 'firstname': 'Jonathan H', 'initials': 'JH', 'affiliation': 'Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.'}, {'lastname': 'Dendy', 'firstname': 'Jeffrey M', 'initials': 'JM', 'affiliation': 'Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee.'}, {'lastname': 'Schlaudecker', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': ""Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio.""}, {'lastname': 'Lang', 'firstname': 'Sean M', 'initials': 'SM', 'affiliation': ""Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio.""}, {'lastname': 'Barnett', 'firstname': 'Elizabeth D', 'initials': 'ED', 'affiliation': 'Boston Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.'}, {'lastname': 'Ruberg', 'firstname': 'Frederick L', 'initials': 'FL', 'affiliation': 'Boston Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.'}, {'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'Michael J', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.'}, {'lastname': 'Campbell', 'firstname': 'M Jay', 'initials': 'MJ', 'affiliation': 'Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.'}, {'lastname': 'Lopes', 'firstname': 'Renato D', 'initials': 'RD', 'affiliation': 'Duke University, Durham, North Carolina.'}, {'lastname': 'Sperling', 'firstname': 'Laurence S', 'initials': 'LS', 'affiliation': 'US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.\nSchool of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia.'}, {'lastname': 'Baumblatt', 'firstname': 'Jane A', 'initials': 'JA', 'affiliation': 'US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland.'}, {'lastname': 'Thompson', 'firstname': 'Deborah L', 'initials': 'DL', 'affiliation': 'US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, Maryland.'}, {'lastname': 'Marquez', 'firstname': 'Paige L', 'initials': 'PL', 'affiliation': 'US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.'}, {'lastname': 'Strid', 'firstname': 'Penelope', 'initials': 'P', 'affiliation': 'US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.'}, {'lastname': 'Woo', 'firstname': 'Jared', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.'}, {'lastname': 'Pugsley', 'firstname': 'River', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.'}, {'lastname': 'Reagan-Steiner', 'firstname': 'Sarah', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.'}, {'lastname': 'DeStefano', 'firstname': 'Frank', 'initials': 'F', 'affiliation': 'US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.'}, {'lastname': 'Shimabukuro', 'firstname': 'Tom T', 'initials': 'TT', 'affiliation': 'US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.'}]"

35076660,Screening for Atrial Fibrillation: Updated Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.,[],JAMA,"Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common arrhythmia, increases the risk of stroke.
To review the evidence on screening for AF in adults without prior stroke to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.
PubMed, Cochrane Library, and trial registries through October 5, 2020; references, experts, and literature surveillance through October 31, 2021.
Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of screening among asymptomatic persons without known AF or prior stroke; test accuracy studies; RCTs of anticoagulation among persons with AF; systematic reviews; and observational studies reporting harms.
Two reviewers assessed titles/abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality and extracted data; when at least 3 similar studies were available, meta-analyses were conducted.
Detection of undiagnosed AF, test accuracy, mortality, stroke, stroke-related morbidity, and harms.
Twenty-six studies (N = 113 784) were included. In 1 RCT (n = 28 768) of twice-daily electrocardiography (ECG) screening for 2 weeks, the likelihood of a composite end point (ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, systemic embolism, all-cause mortality, and hospitalization for bleeding) was lower in the screened group over 6.9 years (hazard ratio, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.92-1.00]; P = .045), but that study had numerous limitations. In 4 RCTs (n = 32 491), significantly more AF was detected with intermittent and continuous ECG screening compared with no screening (risk difference range, 1.0%-4.8%). Treatment with warfarin over a mean of 1.5 years in populations with clinical, mostly persistent AF was associated with fewer ischemic strokes (pooled risk ratio [RR], 0.32 [95% CI, 0.20-0.51]; 5 RCTs; n = 2415) and lower all-cause mortality (pooled RR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.50-0.93]) compared with placebo. Treatment with direct oral anticoagulants was also associated with lower incidence of stroke (adjusted odds ratios range, 0.32-0.44) in indirect comparisons with placebo. The pooled RR for major bleeding for warfarin compared with placebo was 1.8 (95% CI, 0.85-3.7; 5 RCTs; n = 2415), and the adjusted odds ratio for major bleeding for direct oral anticoagulants compared with placebo or no treatment ranged from 1.38 to 2.21, but CIs did not exclude a null effect.
Although screening can detect more cases of unknown AF, evidence regarding effects on health outcomes is limited. Anticoagulation was associated with lower risk of first stroke and mortality but with increased risk of major bleeding, although estimates for this harm are imprecise; no trials assessed benefits and harms of anticoagulation among screen-detected populations.",,,,,10.1001/jama.2021.21811,2022-01-26,"[{'lastname': 'Kahwati', 'firstname': 'Leila C', 'initials': 'LC', 'affiliation': 'RTI International-University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center.\nRTI International, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.'}, {'lastname': 'Asher', 'firstname': 'Gary N', 'initials': 'GN', 'affiliation': 'RTI International-University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center.\nDepartment of Family Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.'}, {'lastname': 'Kadro', 'firstname': 'Zachary O', 'initials': 'ZO', 'affiliation': 'RTI International-University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center.\nDepartment of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.'}, {'lastname': 'Keen', 'firstname': 'Susan', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'RTI International-University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center.\nDepartment of Family Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.'}, {'lastname': 'Ali', 'firstname': 'Rania', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': 'RTI International-University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center.\nRTI International, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.'}, {'lastname': 'Coker-Schwimmer', 'firstname': 'Emmanuel', 'initials': 'E', 'affiliation': 'RTI International-University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center.\nDepartment of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus.'}, {'lastname': 'Jonas', 'firstname': 'Daniel E', 'initials': 'DE', 'affiliation': 'RTI International-University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center.\nDepartment of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus.'}]"
35076659,Screening for Atrial Fibrillation: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement.,[],JAMA,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia. The prevalence of AF increases with age, from less than 0.2% in adults younger than 55 years to about 10% in those 85 years or older, with a higher prevalence in men than in women. It is uncertain whether the prevalence of AF differs by race and ethnicity. Atrial fibrillation is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke and is associated with a substantial increase in the risk of stroke. Approximately 20% of patients who have a stroke associated with AF are first diagnosed with AF at the time of the stroke or shortly thereafter.
To update its 2018 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on the benefits and harms of screening for AF in older adults, the accuracy of screening tests, the effectiveness of screening tests to detect previously undiagnosed AF compared with usual care, and the benefits and harms of anticoagulant therapy for the treatment of screen-detected AF in older adults.
Adults 50 years or older without a diagnosis or symptoms of AF and without a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
The USPSTF concludes that evidence is lacking, and the balance of benefits and harms of screening for AF in asymptomatic adults cannot be determined.
The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for AF.

To assess the occurrence of physical, mental, and cognitive symptoms among patients with COVID-19 at 1 year after ICU treatment.
An exploratory prospective multicenter cohort study conducted in ICUs of 11 Dutch hospitals. Patients (N = 452) with COVID-19, aged 16 years and older, and alive after hospital discharge following admission to 1 of the 11 ICUs during the first COVID-19 surge (March 1, 2020, until July 1, 2020) were eligible for inclusion. Patients were followed up for 1 year, and the date of final follow-up was June 16, 2021.
Patients with COVID-19 who received ICU treatment and survived 1 year after ICU admission.
The main outcomes were self-reported occurrence of physical symptoms (frailty [Clinical Frailty Scale score ≥5], fatigue [Checklist Individual Strength-fatigue subscale score ≥27], physical problems), mental symptoms (anxiety [Hospital Anxiety and Depression {HADS} subscale score ≥8], depression [HADS subscale score ≥8], posttraumatic stress disorder [mean Impact of Event Scale score ≥1.75]), and cognitive symptoms (Cognitive Failure Questionnaire-14 score ≥43) 1 year after ICU treatment and measured with validated questionnaires.
Of the 452 eligible patients, 301 (66.8%) patients could be included, and 246 (81.5%) patients (mean [SD] age, 61.2 [9.3] years; 176 men [71.5%]; median ICU stay, 18 days [IQR, 11 to 32]) completed the 1-year follow-up questionnaires. At 1 year after ICU treatment for COVID-19, physical symptoms were reported by 182 of 245 patients (74.3% [95% CI, 68.3% to 79.6%]), mental symptoms were reported by 64 of 244 patients (26.2% [95% CI, 20.8% to 32.2%]), and cognitive symptoms were reported by 39 of 241 patients (16.2% [95% CI, 11.8% to 21.5%]). The most frequently reported new physical problems were weakened condition (95/244 patients [38.9%]), joint stiffness (64/243 patients [26.3%]) joint pain (62/243 patients [25.5%]), muscle weakness (60/242 patients [24.8%]) and myalgia (52/244 patients [21.3%]).

35072713,Effect of Noninvasive Respiratory Strategies on Intubation or Mortality Among Patients With Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure and COVID-19: The RECOVERY-RS Randomized Clinical Trial.,[],JAMA,"Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) have been recommended for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19. Uncertainty exists regarding the effectiveness and safety of these noninvasive respiratory strategies.
To determine whether either CPAP or HFNO, compared with conventional oxygen therapy, improves clinical outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19-related acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.
A parallel group, adaptive, randomized clinical trial of 1273 hospitalized adults with COVID-19-related acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The trial was conducted between April 6, 2020, and May 3, 2021, across 48 acute care hospitals in the UK and Jersey. Final follow-up occurred on June 20, 2021.
Adult patients were randomized to receive CPAP (n = 380), HFNO (n = 418), or conventional oxygen therapy (n = 475).
The primary outcome was a composite of tracheal intubation or mortality within 30 days.
The trial was stopped prematurely due to declining COVID-19 case numbers in the UK and the end of the funded recruitment period. Of the 1273 randomized patients (mean age, 57.4 [95% CI, 56.7 to 58.1] years; 66% male; 65% White race), primary outcome data were available for 1260. Crossover between interventions occurred in 17.1% of participants (15.3% in the CPAP group, 11.5% in the HFNO group, and 23.6% in the conventional oxygen therapy group). The requirement for tracheal intubation or mortality within 30 days was significantly lower with CPAP (36.3%; 137 of 377 participants) vs conventional oxygen therapy (44.4%; 158 of 356 participants) (absolute difference, -8% [95% CI, -15% to -1%], P = .03), but was not significantly different with HFNO (44.3%; 184 of 415 participants) vs conventional oxygen therapy (45.1%; 166 of 368 participants) (absolute difference, -1% [95% CI, -8% to 6%], P = .83). Adverse events occurred in 34.2% (130/380) of participants in the CPAP group, 20.6% (86/418) in the HFNO group, and 13.9% (66/475) in the conventional oxygen therapy group.
Among patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure due to COVID-19, an initial strategy of CPAP significantly reduced the risk of tracheal intubation or mortality compared with conventional oxygen therapy, but there was no significant difference between an initial strategy of HFNO compared with conventional oxygen therapy. The study may have been underpowered for the comparison of HFNO vs conventional oxygen therapy, and early study termination and crossover among the groups should be considered when interpreting the findings.

35060999,Association Between 3 Doses of mRNA COVID-19 Vaccine and Symptomatic Infection Caused by the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron and Delta Variants.,[],JAMA,"Assessing COVID-19 vaccine performance against the rapidly spreading SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant is critical to inform public health guidance.
To estimate the association between receipt of 3 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 or Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, stratified by variant (Omicron and Delta).
A test-negative case-control analysis among adults 18 years or older with COVID-like illness tested December 10, 2021, through January 1, 2022, by a national pharmacy-based testing program (4666 COVID-19 testing sites across 49 US states).
Three doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (third dose ≥14 days before test and ≥6 months after second dose) vs unvaccinated and vs 2 doses 6 months or more before test (ie, eligible for a booster dose).
Association between symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (stratified by Omicron or Delta variants defined using S-gene target failure) and vaccination (3 doses vs unvaccinated and 3 doses vs 2 doses). Associations were measured with multivariable multinomial regression. Among cases, a secondary outcome was median cycle threshold values (inversely proportional to the amount of target nucleic acid present) for 3 viral genes, stratified by variant and vaccination status.
Overall, 23 391 cases (13 098 Omicron; 10 293 Delta) and 46 764 controls were included (mean age, 40.3 [SD, 15.6] years; 42 050 [60.1%] women). Prior receipt of 3 mRNA vaccine doses was reported for 18.6% (n = 2441) of Omicron cases, 6.6% (n = 679) of Delta cases, and 39.7% (n = 18 587) of controls; prior receipt of 2 mRNA vaccine doses was reported for 55.3% (n = 7245), 44.4% (n = 4570), and 41.6% (n = 19 456), respectively; and being unvaccinated was reported for 26.0% (n = 3412), 49.0% (n = 5044), and 18.6% (n = 8721), respectively. The adjusted odds ratio for 3 doses vs unvaccinated was 0.33 (95% CI, 0.31-0.35) for Omicron and 0.065 (95% CI, 0.059-0.071) for Delta; for 3 vaccine doses vs 2 doses the adjusted odds ratio was 0.34 (95% CI, 0.32-0.36) for Omicron and 0.16 (95% CI, 0.14-0.17) for Delta. Median cycle threshold values were significantly higher in cases with 3 doses vs 2 doses for both Omicron and Delta (Omicron N gene: 19.35 vs 18.52; Omicron ORF1ab gene: 19.25 vs 18.40; Delta N gene: 19.07 vs 17.52; Delta ORF1ab gene: 18.70 vs 17.28; Delta S gene: 23.62 vs 20.24).
Among individuals seeking testing for COVID-like illness in the US in December 2021, receipt of 3 doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (compared with unvaccinated and with receipt of 2 doses) was less likely among cases with symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with test-negative controls. These findings suggest that receipt of 3 doses of mRNA vaccine, relative to being unvaccinated and to receipt of 2 doses, was associated with protection against both the Omicron and Delta variants, although the higher odds ratios for Omicron suggest less protection for Omicron than for Delta.",,,,,10.1001/jama.2022.0470,2022-01-22,"[{'lastname': 'Accorsi', 'firstname': 'Emma K', 'initials': 'EK', 'affiliation': 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Response, Atlanta, Georgia.\nEpidemic Intelligence Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.'}, {'lastname': 'Britton', 'firstname': 'Amadea', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Response, Atlanta, Georgia.\nEpidemic Intelligence Service, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia.'}, {'lastname': 'Fleming-Dutra', 'firstname': 'Katherine E', 'initials': 'KE', 'affiliation': 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Response, Atlanta, Georgia.'}, {'lastname': 'Smith', 'firstname': 'Zachary R', 'initials': 'ZR', 'affiliation': 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Response, Atlanta, Georgia.'}, {'lastname': 'Shang', 'firstname': 'Nong', 'initials': 'N', 'affiliation': 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Response, Atlanta, Georgia.'}, {'lastname': 'Derado', 'firstname': 'Gordana', 'initials': 'G', 'affiliation': 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Response, Atlanta, Georgia.'}, {'lastname': 'Miller', 'firstname': 'Joseph', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Response, Atlanta, Georgia.'}, {'lastname': 'Schrag', 'firstname': 'Stephanie J', 'initials': 'SJ', 'affiliation': 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Response, Atlanta, Georgia.'}, {'lastname': 'Verani', 'firstname': 'Jennifer R', 'initials': 'JR', 'affiliation': 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Response, Atlanta, Georgia.'}]"

To review survival, in-hospital morbidities, care practices, and neurodevelopmental and functional outcomes at 22-26 months' corrected age for extremely preterm infants.
Prospective registry for extremely preterm infants born at 19 US academic centers that are part of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network. The study included 10 877 infants born at 22-28 weeks' gestational age between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2018, including 2566 infants born before 27 weeks between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2016, who completed follow-up assessments at 22-26 months' corrected age. The last assessment was completed on August 13, 2019. Outcomes were compared with a similar cohort of infants born in 2008-2012 adjusting for gestational age.
Extremely preterm birth.
Survival and 12 in-hospital morbidities were assessed, including necrotizing enterocolitis, infection, intracranial hemorrhage, retinopathy of prematurity, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Infants were assessed at 22-26 months' corrected age for 12 health and functional outcomes, including neurodevelopment, cerebral palsy, vision, hearing, rehospitalizations, and need for assistive devices.
The 10 877 infants were 49.0% female and 51.0% male; 78.3% (8495/10848) survived to discharge, an increase from 76.0% in 2008-2012 (adjusted difference, 2.0%; 95% CI, 1.0%-2.9%). Survival to discharge was 10.9% (60/549) for live-born infants at 22 weeks and 94.0% (2267/2412) at 28 weeks. Survival among actively treated infants was 30.0% (60/200) at 22 weeks and 55.8% (535/958) at 23 weeks. All in-hospital morbidities were more likely among infants born at earlier gestational ages. Overall, 8.9% (890/9956) of infants had necrotizing enterocolitis, 2.4% (238/9957) had early-onset infection, 19.9% (1911/9610) had late-onset infection, 14.3% (1386/9705) had severe intracranial hemorrhage, 12.8% (1099/8585) had severe retinopathy of prematurity, and 8.0% (666/8305) had severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Among 2930 surviving infants with gestational ages of 22-26 weeks eligible for follow-up, 2566 (87.6%) were examined. By 2-year follow-up, 8.4% (214/2555) of children had moderate to severe cerebral palsy, 1.5% (38/2555) had bilateral blindness, 2.5% (64/2527) required hearing aids or cochlear implants, 49.9% (1277/2561) had been rehospitalized, and 15.4% (393/2560) required mobility aids or other supportive devices. Among 2458 fully evaluated infants, 48.7% (1198/2458) had no or mild neurodevelopmental impairment at follow-up, 29.3% (709/2419) had moderate neurodevelopmental impairment, and 21.2% (512/2419) had severe neurodevelopmental impairment.
Among extremely preterm infants born in 2013-2018 and treated at 19 US academic medical centers, 78.3% survived to discharge, a significantly higher rate than for infants born in 2008-2012.

35040887,Effect of P2Y12 Inhibitors on Survival Free of Organ Support Among Non-Critically Ill Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,[],JAMA,"Platelets represent a potential therapeutic target for improved clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19.
To evaluate the benefits and risks of adding a P2Y12 inhibitor to anticoagulant therapy among non-critically ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19.
An open-label, bayesian, adaptive randomized clinical trial including 562 non-critically ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19 was conducted between February 2021 and June 2021 at 60 hospitals in Brazil, Italy, Spain, and the US. The date of final 90-day follow-up was September 15, 2021.
Patients were randomized to a therapeutic dose of heparin plus a P2Y12 inhibitor (n = 293) or a therapeutic dose of heparin only (usual care) (n = 269) in a 1:1 ratio for 14 days or until hospital discharge, whichever was sooner. Ticagrelor was the preferred P2Y12 inhibitor.
The composite primary outcome was organ support-free days evaluated on an ordinal scale that combined in-hospital death (assigned a value of -1) and, for those who survived to hospital discharge, the number of days free of respiratory or cardiovascular organ support up to day 21 of the index hospitalization (range, -1 to 21 days; higher scores indicate less organ support and better outcomes). The primary safety outcome was major bleeding by 28 days as defined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis.
Enrollment of non-critically ill patients was discontinued when the prespecified criterion for futility was met. All 562 patients who were randomized (mean age, 52.7 [SD, 13.5] years; 41.5% women) completed the trial and 87% received a therapeutic dose of heparin by the end of study day 1. In the P2Y12 inhibitor group, ticagrelor was used in 63% of patients and clopidogrel in 37%. The median number of organ support-free days was 21 days (IQR, 20-21 days) among patients in the P2Y12 inhibitor group and was 21 days (IQR, 21-21 days) in the usual care group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.83 [95% credible interval, 0.55-1.25]; posterior probability of futility [defined as an odds ratio <1.2], 96%). Major bleeding occurred in 6 patients (2.0%) in the P2Y12 inhibitor group and in 2 patients (0.7%) in the usual care group (adjusted odds ratio, 3.31 [95% CI, 0.64-17.2]; P = .15).
Among non-critically ill patients hospitalized for COVID-19, the use of a P2Y12 inhibitor in addition to a therapeutic dose of heparin, compared with a therapeutic dose of heparin only, did not result in an increased odds of improvement in organ support-free days within 21 days during hospitalization.

35040886,"Trends in US Ambulatory Care Patterns During the COVID-19 Pandemic, 2019-2021.",[],JAMA,"Following reductions in US ambulatory care early in the pandemic, it remains unclear whether care consistently returned to expected rates across insurance types and services.
To assess whether patients with Medicaid or Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibility had significantly lower than expected return to use of ambulatory care rates than patients with commercial, Medicare Advantage, or Medicare fee-for-service insurance.
In this retrospective cohort study examining ambulatory care service patterns from January 1, 2019, through February 28, 2021, claims data from multiple US payers were combined using the Milliman MedInsight research database. Using a difference-in-differences design, the extent to which utilization during the pandemic differed from expected rates had the pandemic not occurred was estimated. Changes in utilization rates between January and February 2020 and each subsequent 2-month time frame during the pandemic were compared with the changes in the corresponding months from the year prior. Age- and sex-adjusted Poisson regression models of monthly utilization counts were used, offsetting for total patient-months and stratifying by service and insurance type.
Patients with Medicaid or Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibility compared with patients with commercial, Medicare Advantage, or Medicare fee-for-service insurance, respectively.
Utilization rates per 100 people for 6 services: emergency department, office and urgent care, behavioral health, screening colonoscopies, screening mammograms, and contraception counseling or HIV screening.
More than 14.5 million US adults were included (mean age, 52.7 years; 54.9% women). In the March-April 2020 time frame, the combined use of 6 ambulatory services declined to 67.0% (95% CI, 66.9%-67.1%) of expected rates, but returned to 96.7% (95% CI, 96.6%-96.8%) of expected rates by the November-December 2020 time frame. During the second COVID-19 wave in the January-February 2021 time frame, overall utilization again declined to 86.2% (95% CI, 86.1%-86.3%) of expected rates, with colonoscopy remaining at 65.0% (95% CI, 64.1%-65.9%) and mammography at 79.2% (95% CI, 78.5%-79.8%) of expected rates. By the January-February 2021 time frame, overall utilization returned to expected rates as follows: patients with Medicaid at 78.4% (95% CI, 78.2%-78.7%), Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibility at 73.3% (95% CI, 72.8%-73.8%), commercial at 90.7% (95% CI, 90.5%-90.9%), Medicare Advantage at 83.2% (95% CI, 81.7%-82.2%), and Medicare fee-for-service at 82.0% (95% CI, 81.7%-82.2%; P < .001; comparing return to expected utilization rates among patients with Medicaid and Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibility, respectively, with each of the other insurance types).
Between March 2020 and February 2021, aggregate use of 6 ambulatory care services increased after the preceding decrease in utilization that followed the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the rate of increase in use of these ambulatory care services was significantly lower for participants with Medicaid or Medicare-Medicaid dual eligibility than for those insured by commercial, Medicare Advantage, or Medicare fee-for-service.",,,,,10.1001/jama.2021.24294,2022-01-19,"[{'lastname': 'Mafi', 'firstname': 'John N', 'initials': 'JN', 'affiliation': 'Division of General Internal Medicine and Health Services Research, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles.\nRAND Health, RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Craff', 'firstname': 'Melody', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Milliman MedInsight, Seattle, Washington.'}, {'lastname': 'Vangala', 'firstname': 'Sitaram', 'initials': 'S', 'affiliation': 'Division of General Internal Medicine and Health Services Research, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles.'}, {'lastname': 'Pu', 'firstname': 'Thomas', 'initials': 'T', 'affiliation': 'Milliman MedInsight, Seattle, Washington.'}, {'lastname': 'Skinner', 'firstname': 'Dale', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Milliman MedInsight, Seattle, Washington.'}, {'lastname': 'Tabatabai-Yazdi', 'firstname': 'Cyrus', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'School of Computer Science, University of California, Los Angeles.'}, {'lastname': 'Nelson', 'firstname': 'Anikia', 'initials': 'A', 'affiliation': 'Milliman MedInsight, Seattle, Washington.'}, {'lastname': 'Reid', 'firstname': 'Rachel', 'initials': 'R', 'affiliation': ""RAND Health, RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California.\nDivision of General Internal Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.""}, {'lastname': 'Agniel', 'firstname': 'Denis', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'RAND Health, RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Tseng', 'firstname': 'Chi-Hong', 'initials': 'CH', 'affiliation': 'Division of General Internal Medicine and Health Services Research, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles.'}, {'lastname': 'Sarkisian', 'firstname': 'Catherine', 'initials': 'C', 'affiliation': 'Division of General Internal Medicine and Health Services Research, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles.'}, {'lastname': 'Damberg', 'firstname': 'Cheryl L', 'initials': 'CL', 'affiliation': 'RAND Health, RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California.'}, {'lastname': 'Kahn', 'firstname': 'Katherine L', 'initials': 'KL', 'affiliation': 'Division of General Internal Medicine and Health Services Research, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles.\nRAND Health, RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, California.'}]"

At least 95% of all pulmonary nodules identified are benign, most often granulomas or intrapulmonary lymph nodes. Smaller nodules are more likely to be benign. Pulmonary nodules are categorized as small solid (<8 mm), larger solid (≥8 mm), and subsolid. Subsolid nodules are divided into ground-glass nodules (no solid component) and part-solid (both ground-glass and solid components). The probability of malignancy is less than 1% for all nodules smaller than 6 mm and 1% to 2% for nodules 6 mm to 8 mm. Nodules that are 6 mm to 8 mm can be followed with a repeat chest CT in 6 to 12 months, depending on the presence of patient risk factors and imaging characteristics associated with lung malignancy, clinical judgment about the probability of malignancy, and patient preferences. The treatment of an individual with a solid pulmonary nodule 8 mm or larger is based on the estimated probability of malignancy; the presence of patient comorbidities, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary artery disease; and patient preferences. Management options include surveillance imaging, defined as monitoring for nodule growth with chest CT imaging, positron emission tomography-CT imaging, nonsurgical biopsy with bronchoscopy or transthoracic needle biopsy, and surgical resection. Part-solid pulmonary nodules are managed according to the size of the solid component. Larger solid components are associated with a higher risk of malignancy. Ground-glass pulmonary nodules have a probability of malignancy of 10% to 50% when they persist beyond 3 months and are larger than 10 mm in diameter. A malignant nodule that is entirely ground glass in appearance is typically slow growing. Current bronchoscopy and transthoracic needle biopsy methods yield a sensitivity of 70% to 90% for a diagnosis of lung cancer.
Pulmonary nodules are identified in approximately 1.6 million people per year in the US and approximately 30% of chest CT images. The treatment of an individual with a pulmonary nodule should be guided by the probability that the nodule is malignant, safety of testing, the likelihood that additional testing will be informative, and patient preferences.",,,,,10.1001/jama.2021.24287,2022-01-19,"[{'lastname': 'Mazzone', 'firstname': 'Peter J', 'initials': 'PJ', 'affiliation': 'Respiratory Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.'}, {'lastname': 'Lam', 'firstname': 'Louis', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Respiratory Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio.'}]"

35029629,Effect of Subcutaneous Casirivimab and Imdevimab Antibody Combination vs Placebo on Development of Symptomatic COVID-19 in Early Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,[],JAMA,"Easy-to-administer anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatments may be used to prevent progression from asymptomatic infection to symptomatic disease and to reduce viral carriage.
To evaluate the effect of combination subcutaneous casirivimab and imdevimab on progression from early asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection to symptomatic COVID-19.
Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial of close household contacts of a SARS-CoV-2-infected index case at 112 sites in the US, Romania, and Moldova enrolled July 13, 2020-January 28, 2021; follow-up ended March 11, 2021. Asymptomatic individuals (aged ≥12 years) were eligible if identified within 96 hours of index case positive test collection. Results from 314 individuals positive on SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) testing are reported.
Individuals were randomized 1:1 to receive 1 dose of subcutaneous casirivimab and imdevimab, 1200 mg (600 mg of each; n = 158), or placebo (n = 156).
The primary end point was the proportion of seronegative participants who developed symptomatic COVID-19 during the 28-day efficacy assessment period. The key secondary efficacy end points were the number of weeks of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and the number of weeks of high viral load (>4 log10 copies/mL).
Among 314 randomized participants (mean age, 41.0 years; 51.6% women), 310 (99.7%) completed the efficacy assessment period; 204 were asymptomatic and seronegative at baseline and included in the primary efficacy analysis. Subcutaneous casirivimab and imdevimab, 1200 mg, significantly prevented progression to symptomatic disease (29/100 [29.0%] vs 44/104 [42.3%] with placebo; odds ratio, 0.54 [95% CI, 0.30-0.97]; P = .04; absolute risk difference, -13.3% [95% CI, -26.3% to -0.3%]). Casirivimab and imdevimab reduced the number of symptomatic weeks per 1000 participants (895.7 weeks vs 1637.4 weeks with placebo; P = .03), an approximately 5.6-day reduction in symptom duration per symptomatic participant. Treatment with casirivimab and imdevimab also reduced the number of high viral load weeks per 1000 participants (489.8 weeks vs 811.9 weeks with placebo; P = .001). The proportion of participants receiving casirivimab and imdevimab who had 1 or more treatment-emergent adverse event was 33.5% vs 48.1% for placebo, including events related (25.8% vs 39.7%) or not related (11.0% vs 16.0%) to COVID-19.
Among asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR-positive individuals living with an infected household contact, treatment with subcutaneous casirivimab and imdevimab antibody combination vs placebo significantly reduced the incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 over 28 days.

35015039,Discriminative Accuracy of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Screening Instruments in 3 Low- and Middle-Income Country Settings.,[],JAMA,"Most of the global morbidity and mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) occurs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), with significant economic effects.
To assess the discriminative accuracy of 3 instruments using questionnaires and peak expiratory flow (PEF) to screen for COPD in 3 LMIC settings.
A cross-sectional analysis of discriminative accuracy, conducted between January 2018 and March 2020 in semiurban Bhaktapur, Nepal; urban Lima, Peru; and rural Nakaseke, Uganda, using a random age- and sex-stratified sample of the population 40 years or older.
Three screening tools, the COPD Assessment in Primary Care to Identify Undiagnosed Respiratory Disease and Exacerbation Risk (CAPTURE; range, 0-6; high risk indicated by a score of 5 or more or score 2-5 with low PEF [<250 L/min for females and <350 L/min for males]), the COPD in LMICs Assessment questionnaire (COLA-6; range, 0-5; high risk indicated by a score of 4 or more), and the Lung Function Questionnaire (LFQ; range, 0-25; high risk indicated by a score of 18 or less) were assessed against a reference standard diagnosis of COPD using quality-assured postbronchodilator spirometry. CAPTURE and COLA-6 include a measure of PEF.
The primary outcome was discriminative accuracy of the tools in identifying COPD as measured by area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) with 95% CIs. Secondary outcomes included sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value.
Among 10 709 adults who consented to participate in the study (mean age, 56.3 years (SD, 11.7); 50% female), 35% had ever smoked, and 30% were currently exposed to biomass smoke. The unweighted prevalence of COPD at the 3 sites was 18.2% (642/3534 participants) in Nepal, 2.7% (97/3550) in Peru, and 7.4% (264/3580) in Uganda. Among 1000 COPD cases, 49.3% had clinically important disease (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease classification B-D), 16.4% had severe or very severe airflow obstruction (forced expiratory volume in 1 second <50% predicted), and 95.3% of cases were previously undiagnosed. The AUC for the screening instruments ranged from 0.717 (95% CI, 0.677-0.774) for LFQ in Peru to 0.791 (95% CI, 0.770-0.809) for COLA-6 in Nepal. The sensitivity ranged from 34.8% (95% CI, 25.3%-45.2%) for COLA-6 in Nepal to 64.2% (95% CI, 60.3%-67.9%) for CAPTURE in Nepal.

35015038,Effect of Anticoagulant Therapy for 6 Weeks vs 3 Months on Recurrence and Bleeding Events in Patients Younger Than 21 Years of Age With Provoked Venous Thromboembolism: The Kids-DOTT Randomized Clinical Trial.,[],JAMA,"Among patients younger than 21 years of age, the optimal duration of anticoagulant therapy for venous thromboembolism is unknown.
To test the hypothesis that a 6-week duration of anticoagulant therapy for provoked venous thromboembolism is noninferior to a conventional 3-month therapy duration in patients younger than 21 years of age.
Randomized clinical trial involving 417 patients younger than 21 years of age with acute, provoked venous thromboembolism enrolled at 42 centers in 5 countries from 2008-2021. The main exclusions were severe anticoagulant deficiencies or prior venous thromboembolism. Patients without persistent antiphospholipid antibodies and whose thrombi were resolved or not completely occlusive upon repeat imaging at 6 weeks after diagnosis underwent randomization. The final visit for the primary end points occurred in January 2021.
Total duration for anticoagulant therapy of 6 weeks (n = 207) vs 3 months (n = 210) for provoked venous thromboembolism.
The primary efficacy and safety end points were centrally adjudicated symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism and clinically relevant bleeding events within 1 year blinded to treatment group. The primary analysis was noninferiority in the per-protocol population. The noninferiority boundary incorporated a bivariate trade-off that included an absolute increase of 0% in symptomatic recurrent venous thromboembolism with an absolute risk reduction of 4% in clinically relevant bleeding events (1 of 3 points on the bivariate noninferiority boundary curve).
Among 417 randomized patients, 297 (median age, 8.3 [range, 0.04-20.9] years; 49% female) met criteria for the primary per-protocol population analysis. The Kaplan-Meier estimate for the 1-year cumulative incidence of the primary efficacy outcome was 0.66% (95% CI, 0%-1.95%) in the 6-week anticoagulant therapy group and 0.70% (95% CI, 0%-2.07%) in the 3-month anticoagulant therapy group, and for the primary safety outcome, the incidence was 0.65% (95% CI, 0%-1.91%) and 0.70% (95% CI, 0%-2.06%). Based on absolute risk differences in recurrent venous thromboembolism and clinically relevant bleeding events between groups, noninferiority was demonstrated. Adverse events occurred in 26% of patients in the 6-week anticoagulant therapy group and in 32% of patients in the 3-month anticoagulant therapy group; the most common adverse event was fever (1.9% and 3.4%, respectively).
Among patients younger than 21 years of age with provoked venous thromboembolism, anticoagulant therapy for 6 weeks compared with 3 months met noninferiority criteria based on the trade-off between recurrent venous thromboembolism risk and bleeding risk.

35015037,Effect of Weekly Subcutaneous Semaglutide vs Daily Liraglutide on Body Weight in Adults With Overweight or Obesity Without Diabetes: The STEP 8 Randomized Clinical Trial.,[],JAMA,"Phase 3 trials have not compared semaglutide and liraglutide, glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues available for weight management.
To compare the efficacy and adverse event profiles of once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg, vs once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, 3.0 mg (both with diet and physical activity), in people with overweight or obesity.
Randomized, open-label, 68-week, phase 3b trial conducted at 19 US sites from September 2019 (enrollment: September 11-November 26) to May 2021 (end of follow-up: May 11) in adults with body mass index of 30 or greater or 27 or greater with 1 or more weight-related comorbidities, without diabetes (N = 338).
Participants were randomized (3:1:3:1) to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide, 2.4 mg (16-week escalation; n = 126), or matching placebo, or once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, 3.0 mg (4-week escalation; n = 127), or matching placebo, plus diet and physical activity. Participants unable to tolerate 2.4 mg of semaglutide could receive 1.7 mg; participants unable to tolerate 3.0 mg of liraglutide discontinued treatment and could restart the 4-week titration. Placebo groups were pooled (n = 85).
The primary end point was percentage change in body weight, and confirmatory secondary end points were achievement of 10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more weight loss, assessed for semaglutide vs liraglutide at week 68. Semaglutide vs liraglutide comparisons were open-label, with active treatment groups double-blinded against matched placebo groups. Comparisons of active treatments vs pooled placebo were supportive secondary end points.
Of 338 randomized participants (mean [SD] age, 49 [13] years; 265 women [78.4%]; mean [SD] body weight, 104.5 [23.8] kg; mean [SD] body mass index, 37.5 [6.8]), 319 (94.4%) completed the trial, and 271 (80.2%) completed treatment. The mean weight change from baseline was -15.8% with semaglutide vs -6.4% with liraglutide (difference, -9.4 percentage points [95% CI, -12.0 to -6.8]; P < .001); weight change with pooled placebo was -1.9%. Participants had significantly greater odds of achieving 10% or more, 15% or more, and 20% or more weight loss with semaglutide vs liraglutide (70.9% of participants vs 25.6% [odds ratio, 6.3 {95% CI, 3.5 to 11.2}], 55.6% vs 12.0% [odds ratio, 7.9 {95% CI, 4.1 to 15.4}], and 38.5% vs 6.0% [odds ratio, 8.2 {95% CI, 3.5 to 19.1}], respectively; all P < .001). Proportions of participants discontinuing treatment for any reason were 13.5% with semaglutide and 27.6% with liraglutide. Gastrointestinal adverse events were reported by 84.1% with semaglutide and 82.7% with liraglutide.
Among adults with overweight or obesity without diabetes, once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide compared with once-daily subcutaneous liraglutide, added to counseling for diet and physical activity, resulted in significantly greater weight loss at 68 weeks.

35015033,Diagnosis and Treatment of Sexually Transmitted Infections: A Review.,[],JAMA,"Approximately 1 in 5 adults in the US had a sexually transmitted infection (STI) in 2018. This review provides an update on the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, Mycoplasma genitalium, trichomoniasis, and genital herpes.
From 2015 to 2019, the rates of gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis increased in the US; from 1999 to 2016, while the rates of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 declined. Populations with higher rates of STIs include people younger than 25 years, sexual and gender minorities such as men and transgender women who have sex with men, and racial and ethnic minorities such as Black and Latinx people. Approximately 70% of infections with HSV and trichomoniasis and 53% to 100% of extragenital gonorrhea and chlamydia infections are asymptomatic or associated with few symptoms. STIs are associated with HIV acquisition and transmission and are the leading cause of tubal factor infertility in women. Nucleic acid amplification tests have high sensitivities (86.1%-100%) and specificities (97.1%-100%) for the diagnosis of gonorrhea, chlamydia, M genitalium, trichomoniasis, and symptomatic HSV-1 and HSV-2. Serology remains the recommended method to diagnose syphilis, typically using sequential testing to detect treponemal and nontreponemal (antiphospholipid) antibodies. Ceftriaxone, doxycycline, penicillin, moxifloxacin, and the nitroimidazoles, such as metronidazole, are effective treatments for gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis, M genitalium, and trichomoniasis, respectively, but antimicrobial resistance limits oral treatment options for gonorrhea and M genitalium. No cure is available for genital herpes. Effective STI prevention interventions include screening, contact tracing of sexual partners, and promoting effective barrier contraception.

Data are lacking on the effectiveness of booster doses for younger individuals and health care workers.
To estimate the association of a BNT162b2 booster dose with SARS-CoV-2 infections among health care workers who were previously vaccinated with a 2-dose series of BNT162b2.
This was a prospective cohort study conducted at a tertiary medical center in Tel Aviv, Israel. The study cohort included 1928 immunocompetent health care workers who were previously vaccinated with a 2-dose series of BNT162b2, and had enrolled between August 8 and 19, 2021, with final follow-up reported through September 20, 2021. Screening for SARS-CoV-2 infection was performed every 14 days. Anti-spike protein receptor binding domain IgG titers were determined at baseline and 1 month after enrollment. Cox regression with time-dependent analysis was used to estimate hazard ratios of SARS-CoV-2 infection between booster-immunized status and 2-dose vaccinated (booster-nonimmunized) status.
Vaccination with a booster dose of BNT162b2 vaccine.
The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection, as confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction.
Among 1928 participants, the median age was 44 years (IQR, 36-52 years) and 1381 were women (71.6%). Participants completed the 2-dose vaccination series a median of 210 days (IQR, 205-213 days) before study enrollment. A total of 1650 participants (85.6%) received the booster dose. During a median follow-up of 39 days (IQR, 35-41 days), SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred in 44 participants (incidence rate, 60.2 per 100 000 person-days); 31 (70.5%) were symptomatic. Five SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred in booster-immunized participants and 39 in booster-nonimmunized participants (incidence rate, 12.8 vs 116 per 100 000 person-days, respectively). In a time-dependent Cox regression analysis, the adjusted hazard ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infection for booster-immunized vs booster-nonimmunized participants was 0.07 (95% CI, 0.02-0.20).
Among health care workers at a single center in Israel who were previously vaccinated with a 2-dose series of BNT162b2, administration of a booster dose compared with not receiving one was associated with a significantly lower rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection over a median of 39 days of follow-up.

35006207,Websites or Videos: Which Offer Better Information for Patients? A Comparative Analysis of the Quality of YouTube Videos and Websites for Cosmetic Injectables.,[],Plastic and reconstructive surgery,"YouTube is used by more than 70 percent of adults and 81 percent of 15- to 25-year-olds. The information quality of videos related to the two most performed aesthetic procedures-botulinum toxin type A (Botox) and soft-tissue filler injections-has not been assessed or compared to that of websites.
A YouTube search for ""Botox"" and ""fillers"" was performed in July of 2020, identifying the most popular health information videos. Quality was assessed using the validated Journal of American Medical Association, Health on the Net principles, and the DISCERN criteria in addition to a procedure-specific content score. Quality scores were compared between different groups of video contributors and against websites.
A total of 720 measurements of quality were performed across 95 YouTube videos and 85 websites. The mean quality scores were as follows: Journal of the American Medical Association, 1.74/4 ± 0.718; Health on the Net, 6.66/16 ± 2.07; DISCERN, 40.0/80 ± 9.25; and content, 39.1/100 ± 11.9. Physician, nonphysician health professionals, and other (news, magazine channels, and influencers) were all of higher quality than patient-based videos (p < 0.001). The mean DISCERN percentage score for videos was 50.04 ± 11.57 and significantly less than that of websites, 55.46 ± 15.74 (p = 0.010). The mean content scores showed a similar result, 39.06 ± 11.92 versus 60.76 ± 17.65 (p < 0.001), respectively.
Improvement is needed in the quality of YouTube videos related to aesthetic injectables. Plastic surgeons, who are the most frequent video contributors, are most qualified to provide this change. Plastic surgeons should include videos as part of their online presence, as they may help facilitate a greater viewership.",,,"A total of 720 measurements of quality were performed across 95 YouTube videos and 85 websites.

34985914,eSyM: An Electronic Health Record-Integrated Patient-Reported Outcomes-Based Cancer Symptom Management Program Used by Six Diverse Health Systems.,[],JCO clinical cancer informatics,"Collecting patient-reported outcomes (PROs) can improve symptom control and quality of life, enhance doctor-patient communication, and reduce acute care needs for patients with cancer. Digital solutions facilitate PRO collection, but without robust electronic health record (EHR) integration, effective deployment can be hampered by low patient and clinician engagement and high development and deployment costs. The important components of digital PRO platforms have been defined, but procedures for implementing integrated solutions are not readily available.
As part of the NCI's IMPACT consortium, six health care systems partnered with Epic to develop an EHR-integrated, PRO-based electronic symptom management program (eSyM) to optimize postoperative recovery and well-being during chemotherapy. The agile development process incorporated user-centered design principles that required engagement from patients, clinicians, and health care systems. Whenever possible, the system used validated content from the public domain and took advantage of existing EHR capabilities to automate processes.
eSyM includes symptom surveys on the basis of the PRO-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) plus two global wellness questions; reminders and symptom self-management tip sheets for patients; alerts and symptom reports for clinicians; and population management dashboards. EHR dependencies include a secure Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant patient portal; diagnosis, procedure and chemotherapy treatment plan data; registries that identify and track target populations; and the ability to create reminders, alerts, reports, dashboards, and charting shortcuts.
eSyM incorporates validated content and leverages existing EHR capabilities. Build challenges include the innate technical limitations of the EHR, the constrained availability of site technical resources, and sites' heterogenous EHR configurations and policies. Integration of PRO-based symptom management programs into the EHR could help overcome adoption barriers, consolidate clinical workflows, and foster scalability and sustainability. We intend to make eSyM available to all Epic users.","eSyM incorporates validated content and leverages existing EHR capabilities.

When multiple treatment candidates are available, rapid scientific therapeutic discoveries may be made. Platform trials have important potential advantages in creating an efficient trial infrastructure that can help address critical clinical questions as the evidence evolves. Platform trials have recently been used in investigations of evolving therapies for patients with COVID-19.

34982120,Association Between Maternal Hormonal Contraception Use and Central Nervous System Tumors in Children.,[],JAMA,"The incidence of central nervous system (CNS) tumors in children appears to be increasing, yet few risk factors are established. There is limited information regarding whether maternal hormonal contraception use increases this risk.
To examine the association between maternal hormonal contraception use and CNS tumors in children (<20 years).
In this nationwide cohort study based on population-based registry data, 1 185 063 children born in Denmark between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2014, were followed up for a diagnosis of a CNS tumor (final follow-up on December 31, 2018).
Maternal hormonal contraception use was analyzed according to any use, regimen (combined/progestin only), and route of administration (oral/nonoral), categorized as recent use (≤3 months before start and during pregnancy), previous use (>3 months before start of pregnancy), and no use. For injections, implants, and intrauterine devices that are used for a different time period, the categorization was appropriately altered.
Hazard ratio (HR) and incidence rate difference (IRD) of CNS tumors diagnosed at younger than 20 years.
After 15 335 990 person-years of follow-up (mean follow-up, 12.9 years), 725 children were diagnosed with a CNS tumor. The mean age at diagnosis was 7 years, and 342 (47.2%) of the diagnosed children were female. The adjusted incidence rate of CNS tumors per 100 000 person-years was 5.0 for children born to mothers with recent hormonal contraception use (n = 136 022), 4.5 for children born to mothers with previous use (n = 778 843), and 5.3 for children born to mothers with no use (n = 270 198). The corresponding HRs were 0.95 ([95% CI, 0.74-1.23]; 84 children with CNS tumors; IRD, -0.3 [95% CI, -1.6 to 1.0]) for recent use and 0.86 ([95% CI, 0.72-1.02]; 421 children with CNS tumors; IRD, -0.8 [95% CI, -1.7 to 0.0]) for previous use, compared with no use. No statistically significant associations were found for recent or previous use of oral combined, nonoral combined, oral progestin only, or nonoral products compared with no use of hormonal contraception.
Among Danish children, there was no statistically significant association between any maternal hormonal contraception use and CNS tumor risk.",,,,,10.1001/jama.2021.22482,2022-01-05,"[{'lastname': 'Hargreave', 'firstname': 'Marie', 'initials': 'M', 'affiliation': 'Virus, Lifestyle and Genes, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Mørch', 'firstname': 'Lina S', 'initials': 'LS', 'affiliation': 'Virus, Lifestyle and Genes, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.\nCancer Surveillance and Pharmacoepidemiology, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Winther', 'firstname': 'Jeanette F', 'initials': 'JF', 'affiliation': 'Childhood Cancer Research Group, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.\nDepartment of Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health, Aarhus University and University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Schmiegelow', 'firstname': 'Kjeld', 'initials': 'K', 'affiliation': 'Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Juliane Marie Centre, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.\nFaculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen and the Pediatric Clinic, Juliane Marie Centre, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Kjaer', 'firstname': 'Susanne K', 'initials': 'SK', 'affiliation': 'Virus, Lifestyle and Genes, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Copenhagen, Denmark.\nDepartment of Gynecology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.'}]"
34982119,Effect of a Community-Based Medical Oncology Depression Screening Program on Behavioral Health Referrals Among Patients With Breast Cancer: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,[],JAMA,"Implementation of guideline-recommended depression screening in medical oncology remains challenging. Evidence suggests that multicomponent care pathways with algorithm-based referral and management are effective, yet implementation of sustainable programs remains limited and implementation-science guided approaches are understudied.
To evaluate the effectiveness of an implementation-strategy guided depression screening program for patients with breast cancer in a community setting.
A pragmatic cluster randomized clinical trial conducted within Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC). The trial included 6 medical centers and 1436 patients diagnosed with new primary breast cancer who had a consultation with medical oncology between October 1, 2017, through September 30, 2018. Patients were followed up through study end date of May 31, 2019.
Six medical centers in Southern California participated and were randomized 1:1 to tailored implementation strategies (intervention, 3 sites, n = 744 patients) or education-only (control, 3 sites, n = 692 patients) groups. The program consisted of screening with the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and algorithm-based scoring and referral to behavioral health services based on low, moderate, or high score. Clinical teams at tailored intervention sites received program education, audit, and feedback of performance data and implementation facilitation, and clinical workflows were adapted to suit local context. Education-only controls sites received program education.
The primary outcome was percent of eligible patients screened and referred (based on PHQ-9 score) at intervention vs control groups measured at the patient level. Secondary outcomes included outpatient health care utilization for behavioral health, primary care, oncology, urgent care, and emergency department.
All 1436 eligible patients were randomized at the center level (mean age, 61.5 years; 99% women; 18% Asian, 17% Black, 26% Hispanic, and 37% White) and were followed up to the end of the study, insurance disenrollment, or death. Groups were similar in demographic and tumor characteristics. For the primary outcome, 7.9% (59 of 744) of patients at tailored sites were referred compared with 0.1% (1 of 692) at education-only sites (difference, 7.8%; 95% CI, 5.8%-9.8%). Referrals to a behavioral health clinician were completed by 44 of 59 patients treated at the intervention sites (75%) intervention sites vs 1 of 1 patient at the education-only sites (100%). In adjusted models patients at tailored sites had significantly fewer outpatient visits in medical oncology (rate ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.86-0.89; P = .001), and no significant difference in utilization of primary care, urgent care, and emergency department visits.
Among patients with breast cancer treated in community-based oncology practices, tailored strategies for implementation of routine depression screening compared with an education-only control group resulted in a greater proportion of referrals to behavioral care. Further research is needed to understand the clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness of this program.

Receiving this diagnosis can have a profound impact on patients and their families and this is compounded by the nuanced complexities around their management. An overwhelming majority of patients research health information using the internet. Patient-centred care and informed consent requires patients to have access to information that is readable and reliable. The aim of this study was to assess the readability and reliability of online health information about intracranial aneurysms.
A Google search was conducted using the terms 'brain aneurysm', 'cerebral aneurysm', and 'intracranial aneurysm' and the first 75 websites were screened for assessment. The readability of each website was assessed using the Flesch reading ease score (FRE), the Flesch-Kincaid grade level (FKGL), the gunning fog index (GFI) and the simple measure of gobbledygook (SMOG) indices. Reliability was assessed using the DISCERN instrument and the Journal of the American Medical Association benchmark criteria (JAMA).
Following exclusion, 36 websites were analyzed. The websites collectively scored as 'difficult' readability and 'poor' reliability on average. Statistically significant differences in readability were observed between websites categorized as patient health information and commercial compared with academic and physician. Differences in readability were also observed between search results of 'brain aneurysm' compared with 'intracranial aneurysm'.

To estimate trends in prevalence, awareness, treatment, and risk factors of diabetes in China based on national data.
Cross-sectional nationally representative survey data collected in adults aged 18 years or older in mainland China from 170 287 participants in the 2013-2014 years and 173 642 participants in the 2018-2019 years.
Fasting plasma glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels were measured for all participants. A 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test was conducted for all participants without diagnosed diabetes.
Primary outcomes were diabetes and prediabetes defined according to American Diabetes Association criteria. Secondary outcomes were awareness, treatment, and control of diabetes and prevalence of risk factors. A hemoglobin A1c level of less than 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) among treated patients with diabetes was considered adequate glycemic control.
In 2013, the median age was 55.8 years (IQR, 46.4-65.2 years) and the weighted proportion of women was 50.0%; in 2018, the median age was 51.3 years (IQR, 42.1-61.6 years), and the weighted proportion of women was 49.5%. The estimated prevalence of diabetes increased from 10.9% (95% CI, 10.4%-11.5%) in 2013 to 12.4% (95% CI, 11.8%-13.0%) in 2018 (P < .001). The estimated prevalence of prediabetes was 35.7% (95% CI, 34.2%-37.3%) in 2013 and 38.1% (95% CI, 36.4%-39.7%) in 2018 (P = .07). In 2018, among adults with diabetes, 36.7% (95% CI, 34.7%-38.6%) reported being aware of their condition, and 32.9% (95% CI, 30.9%-34.8%) reported being treated; 50.1% (95% CI, 47.5%-52.6%) of patients receiving treatment were controlled adequately. These rates did not change significantly from 2013. From 2013 to 2018, low physical activity, high intake of red meat, overweight, and obesity significantly increased in prevalence.
In this survey study, the estimated diabetes prevalence was high and increased from 2013 to 2018.

34962522,"Contraception Selection, Effectiveness, and Adverse Effects: A Review.",[],JAMA,"Many women spend a substantial proportion of their lives preventing or planning for pregnancy, and approximately 87% of US women use contraception during their lifetime.
Contraceptive effectiveness is determined by a combination of drug or device efficacy, individual fecundability, coital frequency, and user adherence and continuation. In the US, oral contraceptive pills are the most commonly used reversible method of contraception and comprise 21.9% of all contraception in current use. Pregnancy rates of women using oral contraceptives are 4% to 7% per year. Use of long-acting methods, such as intrauterine devices and subdermal implants, has increased substantially, from 6% of all contraceptive users in 2008 to 17.8% in 2016; these methods have failure rates of less than 1% per year. Estrogen-containing methods, such as combined oral contraceptive pills, increase the risk of venous thrombosis from 2 to 10 venous thrombotic events per 10 000 women-years to 7 to 10 venous thrombotic events per 10 000 women-years, whereas progestin-only and nonhormonal methods, such as implants and condoms, are associated with rare serious risks. Hormonal contraceptives can improve medical conditions associated with hormonal changes related to the menstrual cycle, such as acne, endometriosis, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Optimal contraceptive selection requires patient and clinician discussion of the patient's tolerance for risk of pregnancy, menstrual bleeding changes, other risks, and personal values and preferences.
Oral contraceptive pills are the most commonly used reversible contraceptives, intrauterine devices and subdermal implants have the highest effectiveness, and progestin-only and nonhormonal methods have the lowest risks.

34932079,Effect of Long-term Supplementation With Marine Omega-3 Fatty Acids vs Placebo on Risk of Depression or Clinically Relevant Depressive Symptoms and on Change in Mood Scores: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,[],JAMA,"Marine omega-3 fatty acid (omega-3) supplements have been used to treat depression but their ability to prevent depression in the general adult population is unknown.
To test effects of omega-3 supplementation on late-life depression risk and mood scores.
A total of 18 353 adults participated in the VITAL-DEP (Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial-Depression Endpoint Prevention) ancillary study to VITAL, a randomized trial of cardiovascular disease and cancer prevention among 25 871 US adults. There were 16 657 at risk of incident depression (no previous depression) and 1696 at risk of recurrent depression (previous depression, but not for the past 2 years). Randomization occurred from November 2011 through March 2014; randomized treatment ended on December 31, 2017.
Randomized 2 × 2 factorial assignment to vitamin D3 (2000 IU/d), marine omega-3 fatty acids (1 g/d of fish oil, including 465 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid and 375 mg of docosahexaenoic acid) or placebo; 9171 were randomized to omega-3 and 9182 were randomized to matching placebo.
Prespecified coprimary outcomes were risk of depression or clinically relevant depressive symptoms (total of incident + recurrent cases); mean difference in mood score (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-8] depression scale).
Among 18 353 participants who were randomized (mean age, 67.5 [SD, 7.1] years; 49.2% women), 90.3% completed the trial (93.5% among those alive at the end of the trial); the median treatment duration was 5.3 years. The test for interaction between the omega-3 and the vitamin D agents was not significant (P for interaction = .14). Depression risk was significantly higher comparing omega-3 (651 events, 13.9 per 1000 person-years) with placebo (583 events, 12.3 per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio [HR], 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.26; P = .03). No significant differences were observed comparing omega-3 with placebo groups in longitudinal mood scores: the mean difference in change in PHQ-8 score was 0.03 points (95% CI, -0.01 to 0.07; P = .19). Regarding serious and common adverse events, the respective prevalence values in omega-3 vs placebo groups were major cardiovascular events (2.7% vs 2.9%), all-cause mortality (3.3% vs 3.1%), suicide (0.02% vs 0.01%), gastrointestinal bleeding (2.6% vs 2.7%), easy bruising (24.8% vs 25.1%), and stomach upset or pain (35.2% vs 35.1%).
Among adults aged 50 years or older without clinically relevant depressive symptoms at baseline, treatment with omega-3 supplements compared with placebo yielded mixed results, with a small but statistically significant increase in risk of depression or clinically relevant depressive symptoms but no difference in mood scores, over a median follow-up of 5.3 years. These findings do not support the use of omega-3 supplements in adults to prevent depression.

34932078,Association of Rivaroxaban vs Apixaban With Major Ischemic or Hemorrhagic Events in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation.,[],JAMA,"The comparative effectiveness of rivaroxaban and apixaban, the most frequently prescribed oral anticoagulants for ischemic stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation, is uncertain.
To compare major ischemic and hemorrhagic outcomes in patients with atrial fibrillation treated with rivaroxaban or apixaban.
Retrospective cohort study using computerized enrollment and claims files for US Medicare beneficiaries 65 years or older. Between January 1, 2013, and November 30, 2018, a total of 581 451 patients with atrial fibrillation began rivaroxaban or apixaban treatment and were followed up for 4 years, through November 30, 2018.
Rivaroxaban (n = 227 572) and apixaban (n = 353 879), either standard or reduced dose.
The primary outcome was a composite of major ischemic (stroke/systemic embolism) and hemorrhagic (intracerebral hemorrhage/other intracranial bleeding/fatal extracranial bleeding) events. Secondary outcomes were nonfatal extracranial bleeding and total mortality (fatal ischemic/hemorrhagic event or other death during follow-up). Rates, hazard ratios (HRs), and rate differences (RDs) were adjusted for baseline differences in comorbidity with inverse probability of treatment weighting.
Study patients (mean age, 77.0 years; 291 966 [50.2%] women; 134 393 [23.1%] receiving reduced dose) had 474 605 person-years of follow-up (median [IQR] of 174 [62-397] days). The adjusted primary outcome rate for rivaroxaban was 16.1 per 1000 person-years vs 13.4 per 1000 person-years for apixaban (RD, 2.7 [95% CI, 1.9-3.5]; HR, 1.18 [95% CI, 1.12-1.24]).

34932077,Effect of Therapeutic Drug Monitoring vs Standard Therapy During Maintenance Infliximab Therapy on Disease Control in Patients With Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Diseases: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,[],JAMA,"Proactive therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM), consisting of individualized treatment based on scheduled assessments of serum drug levels, has been proposed as an alternative to standard therapy to optimize efficacy and safety of infliximab and other biologic drugs. However, it remains unclear whether proactive TDM improves clinical outcomes during maintenance therapy.
To assess whether proactive TDM during maintenance therapy with infliximab improves treatment efficacy by preventing disease worsening compared with standard infliximab therapy without TDM.
Randomized, parallel-group, open-label clinical trial including 458 adults with rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, or psoriasis undergoing maintenance therapy with infliximab in 20 Norwegian hospitals. Patients were recruited from June 7, 2017, to December 12, 2019. Final follow-up took place on December 14, 2020.
Patients were randomized 1:1 to proactive TDM with dose and interval adjustments based on scheduled monitoring of serum drug levels and antidrug antibodies (TDM group; n = 228) or to standard infliximab therapy without drug and antibody level monitoring (standard therapy group; n = 230).
The primary outcome was sustained disease control without disease worsening, defined by disease-specific composite scores or consensus about disease worsening between patient and physician leading to a major change in treatment (switching to another biologic drug, adding an immunosuppressive drug including glucocorticoids, or increasing the infliximab dose), during the 52-week study period.
Among 458 randomized patients (mean age, 44.8 [SD, 14.3] years; 216 women [49.8%]), 454 received their randomly allocated intervention and were included in the full analysis set. The primary outcome of sustained disease control without disease worsening was observed in 167 patients (73.6%) in the TDM group and 127 patients (55.9%) in the standard therapy group. The estimated adjusted difference was 17.6% (95% CI, 9.0%-26.2%; P < .001) favoring TDM. Adverse events were reported in 137 patients (60%) and 142 patients (63%) in the TDM and standard therapy groups, respectively.
Among patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases undergoing maintenance therapy with infliximab, proactive TDM was more effective than treatment without TDM in sustaining disease control without disease worsening. Further research is needed to compare proactive TDM with reactive TDM, to assess the effects on long-term disease complications, and to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this approach.

34928310,Effect of Regional vs General Anesthesia on Incidence of Postoperative Delirium in Older Patients Undergoing Hip Fracture Surgery: The RAGA Randomized Trial.,[],JAMA,"In adults undergoing hip fracture surgery, regional anesthesia may reduce postoperative delirium, but there is uncertainty about its effectiveness.
To investigate, in older adults undergoing surgical repair for hip fracture, the effects of regional anesthesia on the incidence of postoperative delirium compared with general anesthesia.
A randomized, allocation-concealed, open-label, multicenter clinical trial of 950 patients, aged 65 years and older, with or without preexisting dementia, and a fragility hip fracture requiring surgical repair from 9 university teaching hospitals in Southeastern China. Participants were enrolled between October 2014 and September 2018; 30-day follow-up ended November 2018.
Patients were randomized to receive either regional anesthesia (spinal, epidural, or both techniques combined with no sedation; n = 476) or general anesthesia (intravenous, inhalational, or combined anesthetic agents; n = 474).
Primary outcome was incidence of delirium during the first 7 postoperative days. Secondary outcomes analyzed in this article include delirium severity, duration, and subtype; postoperative pain score; length of hospitalization; 30-day all-cause mortality; and complications.
Among 950 randomized patients (mean age, 76.5 years; 247 [26.8%] male), 941 were evaluable for the primary outcome (6 canceled surgery and 3 withdrew consent). Postoperative delirium occurred in 29 (6.2%) in the regional anesthesia group vs 24 (5.1%) in the general anesthesia group (unadjusted risk difference [RD], 1.1%; 95% CI, -1.7% to 3.8%; P = .48; unadjusted relative risk [RR], 1.2 [95% CI, 0.7 to 2.0]; P = .57]). Mean severity score of delirium was 23.0 vs 24.1, respectively (unadjusted difference, -1.1; 95% CI, -4.6 to 3.1). A single delirium episode occurred in 16 (3.4%) vs 10 (2.1%) (unadjusted RD, 1.1%; 95% CI, -1.7% to 3.9%; RR, 1.6 [95% CI, 0.7 to 3.5]). Hypoactive subtype in 11 (37.9%) vs 5 (20.8%) (RD, 11.5; 95% CI, -11.0% to 35.7%; RR, 2.2 [95% CI, 0.8 to 6.3]). Median worst pain score was 0 (IQR, 0 to 20) vs 0 (IQR, 0 to 10) (difference 0; 95% CI, 0 to 0). Median length of hospitalization was 7 days (IQR, 5 to 10) vs 7 days (IQR, 6 to 10) (difference 0; 95% CI, 0 to 0). Death occurred in 8 (1.7%) vs 4 (0.9%) (unadjusted RD, -0.8%; 95% CI, -2.2% to 0.7%; RR, 2.0 [95% CI, 0.6 to 6.5]). Adverse events were reported in 106 episodes in the regional anesthesia group and 102 in the general anesthesia group; the most frequently reported adverse events were nausea and vomiting (47 [44.3%] vs 34 [33.3%]) and postoperative hypotension (13 [12.3%] vs 10 [9.8%]).
In patients aged 65 years and older undergoing hip fracture surgery, regional anesthesia without sedation did not significantly reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium compared with general anesthesia.

34905747,Quality and readability of online health information on menopausal hormone therapy in Canada: what are our patients reading?,[],"Menopause (New York, N.Y.)","To assess the quality and readability of 24 of the most accessed menopause hormone therapy (MHT) websites by Canadian women.
The top 24 websites from Google, Bing, and Yahoo were identified using the search term ""hormone replacement therapy."" Five menopause specialists assessed website content quality using the DISCERN Instrument, Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) benchmarks, and Abbott's Scale. Two reviewers assessed website credibility using the Health on the Net Foundation Code of Conduct certification, and website readability using the Simple Measure of Gobbledygook, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, and Flesch-Kincaid Read Ease formulae.
Scores for quality of information varied. The mean JAMA score was low at 2.3 ± 1.1 (out of 4). Only one website met all benchmarks. Fourteen websites (58%) had a good/excellent DISCERN score, while four (17%) had a poor/very poor score. For Abbott's Scale, both the mean authorship score at 2.2 ± 1.0 (out of 4) and mean content score at 45.9 ± 9.8 (out of 100) were low. Inter-rater reliability was high for all tools. Fifteen websites (63%) were Health on the Net Foundation Code of Conduct certified. The mean Flesch-Kincaid Read Ease was 42.7 ± 10.3, mean Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level was 12.3 ± 1.9, and mean Simple Measure of Gobbledygook grade level was 11.3 ± 1.5. Only one website presented content at a reading level recommended for the public. Websites meeting more JAMA benchmarks were significantly less readable (P < 0.05).
Although good quality MHT information exists online, several resources are inaccurate or incomplete. Overall, these resources are not considered comprehensible by the public. There is a need to disseminate accurate, comprehensive, and understandable MHT information online.","Although good quality MHT information exists online, several resources are inaccurate or incomplete.

34905031,Association Between Preserved Ratio Impaired Spirometry and Clinical Outcomes in US Adults.,[],JAMA,"Chronic lung diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Unlike chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, clinical outcomes associated with proportional reductions in expiratory lung volumes without obstruction, otherwise known as preserved ratio impaired spirometry (PRISm), are poorly understood.
To examine the prevalence, correlates, and clinical outcomes associated with PRISm in US adults.
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) Pooled Cohorts Study was a retrospective study with harmonized pooled data from 9 US general population-based cohorts (enrollment, 65 251 participants aged 18 to 102 years of whom 53 701 participants had valid baseline lung function) conducted from 1971-2011 (final follow-up, December 2018).
Participants were categorized into mutually exclusive groups by baseline lung function. PRISm was defined as the ratio of forced expiratory volume in the first second to forced vital capacity (FEV1:FVC) greater than or equal to 0.70 and FEV1 less than 80% predicted; obstructive spirometry FEV1:FVC ratio of less than 0.70; and normal spirometry FEV1:FVC ratio greater than or equal to 0.7 and FEV1 greater than or equal to 80% predicted.
Main outcomes were all-cause mortality, respiratory-related mortality, coronary heart disease (CHD)-related mortality, respiratory-related events (hospitalizations and mortality), and CHD-related events (hospitalizations and mortality) classified by adjudication or validated administrative criteria. Absolute risks were adjusted for age and smoking status. Poisson and Cox proportional hazards models comparing PRISm vs normal spirometry were adjusted for age, sex, race and ethnicity, education, body mass index, smoking status, cohort, and comorbidities.
Among all participants (mean [SD] age, 53.2 [15.8] years, 56.4% women, 48.5% never-smokers), 4582 (8.5%) had PRISm. The presence of PRISm relative to normal spirometry was significantly associated with obesity (prevalence, 48.3% vs 31.4%; prevalence ratio [PR], 1.68 [95% CI, 1.55-1.82]), underweight (prevalence, 1.4% vs 1.0%; PR, 2.20 [95% CI, 1.72-2.82]), female sex (prevalence, 60.3% vs 59.0%; PR, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.01-1.13]), and current smoking (prevalence, 25.2% vs 17.5%; PR, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.22-1.45]). PRISm, compared with normal spirometry, was significantly associated with greater all-cause mortality (29.6/1000 person-years vs 18.0/1000 person-years; difference, 11.6/1000 person-years [95% CI, 10.0-13.1]; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.50 [95% CI, 1.42-1.59]), respiratory-related mortality (2.1/1000 person-years vs 1.0/1000 person-years; difference, 1.1/1000 person-years [95% CI, 0.7-1.6]; adjusted HR, 1.95 [95% CI, 1.54-2.48]), CHD-related mortality (5.4/1000 person-years vs 2.6/1000 person-years; difference, 2.7/1000 person-years [95% CI, 2.1-3.4]; adjusted HR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.36-1.77]), respiratory-related events (12.2/1000 person-years vs 6.0/1000 person-years; difference, 6.2/1000 person-years [95% CI, 4.9-7.5]; adjusted HR, 1.90 [95% CI, 1.69-2.14]), and CHD-related events (11.7/1000 person-years vs 7.0/1000 person-years; difference, 4.7/1000 person-years [95% CI, 3.7-5.8]; adjusted HR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.18-1.42]).
In a large, population-based sample of US adults, baseline PRISm, compared with normal spirometry, was associated with a small but statistically significant increased risk for mortality and adverse cardiovascular and respiratory outcomes.

34905030,Heterogeneity of Treatment Effects in an Analysis of Pooled Individual Patient Data From Randomized Trials of Device Closure of Patent Foramen Ovale After Stroke.,[],JAMA,"Patent foramen ovale (PFO)-associated strokes comprise approximately 10% of ischemic strokes in adults aged 18 to 60 years. While device closure decreases stroke recurrence risk overall, the best treatment for any individual is often unclear.
To evaluate heterogeneity of treatment effect of PFO closure on stroke recurrence based on previously developed scoring systems.
Investigators for the Systematic, Collaborative, PFO Closure Evaluation (SCOPE) Consortium pooled individual patient data from all 6 randomized clinical trials that compared PFO closure plus medical therapy vs medical therapy alone in patients with PFO-associated stroke, and included a total of 3740 participants. The trials were conducted worldwide from 2000 to 2017.
PFO closure plus medical therapy vs medical therapy alone. Subgroup analyses used the Risk of Paradoxical Embolism (RoPE) Score (a 10-point scoring system in which higher scores reflect younger age and the absence of vascular risk factors) and the PFO-Associated Stroke Causal Likelihood (PASCAL) Classification System, which combines the RoPE Score with high-risk PFO features (either an atrial septal aneurysm or a large-sized shunt) to classify patients into 3 categories of causal relatedness: unlikely, possible, and probable.
Ischemic stroke.
Over a median follow-up of 57 months (IQR, 24-64), 121 outcomes occurred in 3740 patients. The annualized incidence of stroke with medical therapy was 1.09% (95% CI, 0.88%-1.36%) and with device closure was 0.47% (95% CI, 0.35%-0.65%) (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.41 [95% CI, 0.28-0.60]). The subgroup analyses showed statistically significant interaction effects. Patients with low vs high RoPE Score had HRs of 0.61 (95% CI, 0.37-1.00) and 0.21 (95% CI, 0.11-0.42), respectively (P for interaction = .02). Patients classified as unlikely, possible, and probable using the PASCAL Classification System had HRs of 1.14 (95% CI, 0.53-2.46), 0.38 (95% CI, 0.22-0.65), and 0.10 (95% CI, 0.03-0.35), respectively (P for interaction = .003). The 2-year absolute risk reduction was -0.7% (95% CI, -4.0% to 2.6%), 2.1% (95% CI, 0.6%-3.6%), and 2.1% (95% CI, 0.9%-3.4%) in the unlikely, possible, and probable PASCAL categories, respectively. Device-associated adverse events were generally higher among patients classified as unlikely; the absolute risk increases in atrial fibrillation beyond day 45 after randomization with a device were 4.41% (95% CI, 1.02% to 7.80%), 1.53% (95% CI, 0.33% to 2.72%), and 0.65% (95% CI, -0.41% to 1.71%) in the unlikely, possible, and probable PASCAL categories, respectively.
Among patients aged 18 to 60 years with PFO-associated stroke, risk reduction for recurrent stroke with device closure varied across groups classified by their probabilities that the stroke was causally related to the PFO.

34905026,Diagnosis and Management of Acute Appendicitis in Adults: A Review.,[],JAMA,"Acute appendicitis is the most common abdominal surgical emergency in the world, with an annual incidence of 96.5 to 100 cases per 100 000 adults.
The clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis is based on history and physical, laboratory evaluation, and imaging. Classic symptoms of appendicitis include vague periumbilical pain, anorexia/nausea/intermittent vomiting, migration of pain to the right lower quadrant, and low-grade fever. The diagnosis of acute appendicitis is made in approximately 90% of patients presenting with these symptoms. Laparoscopic appendectomy remains the most common treatment. However, increasing evidence suggests that broad-spectrum antibiotics, such as piperacillin-tazobactam monotherapy or combination therapy with either cephalosporins or fluroquinolones with metronidazole, successfully treats uncomplicated acute appendicitis in approximately 70% of patients. Specific imaging findings on computed tomography (CT), such as appendiceal dilatation (appendiceal diameter ≥7 mm), or presence of appendicoliths, defined as the conglomeration of feces in the appendiceal lumen, identify patients for whom an antibiotics-first management strategy is more likely to fail. CT findings of appendicolith, mass effect, and a dilated appendix greater than 13 mm are associated with higher risk of treatment failure (≈40%) of an antibiotics-first approach. Therefore, surgical management should be recommended in patients with CT findings of appendicolith, mass effect, or a dilated appendix who are fit for surgery, defined as having relatively low risk of adverse outcomes or postoperative mortality and morbidity. In patients without high-risk CT findings, either appendectomy or antibiotics can be considered as first-line therapy. In unfit patients without these high-risk CT findings, the antibiotics-first approach is recommended, and surgery may be considered if antibiotic treatment fails. In unfit patients with high-risk CT findings, perioperative risk assessment as well as patient preferences should be considered.
Acute appendicitis affects 96.5 to 100 people per 100 000 adults per year worldwide. Appendectomy remains first-line therapy for acute appendicitis, but treatment with antibiotics rather than surgery is appropriate in selected patients with uncomplicated appendicitis.",,,,,10.1001/jama.2021.20502,2021-12-15,"[{'lastname': 'Moris', 'firstname': 'Dimitrios', 'initials': 'D', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.'}, {'lastname': 'Paulson', 'firstname': 'Erik Karl', 'initials': 'EK', 'affiliation': 'Department of Radiology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.'}, {'lastname': 'Pappas', 'firstname': 'Theodore N', 'initials': 'TN', 'affiliation': 'Department of Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina.'}]"

34902013,Effect of Minimally Invasive Surfactant Therapy vs Sham Treatment on Death or Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia in Preterm Infants With Respiratory Distress Syndrome: The OPTIMIST-A Randomized Clinical Trial.,[],JAMA,"The benefits of surfactant administration via a thin catheter (minimally invasive surfactant therapy [MIST]) in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome are uncertain.
To examine the effect of selective application of MIST at a low fraction of inspired oxygen threshold on survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).
Randomized clinical trial including 485 preterm infants with a gestational age of 25 to 28 weeks who were supported with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and required a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.30 or greater within 6 hours of birth. The trial was conducted at 33 tertiary-level neonatal intensive care units around the world, with blinding of the clinicians and outcome assessors. Enrollment took place between December 16, 2011, and March 26, 2020; follow-up was completed on December 2, 2020.
Infants were randomized to the MIST group (n = 241) and received exogenous surfactant (200 mg/kg of poractant alfa) via a thin catheter or to the control group (n = 244) and received a sham (control) treatment; CPAP was continued thereafter in both groups unless specified intubation criteria were met.
The primary outcome was the composite of death or physiological BPD assessed at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. The components of the primary outcome (death prior to 36 weeks' postmenstrual age and BPD at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age) also were considered separately.
Among the 485 infants randomized (median gestational age, 27.3 weeks; 241 [49.7%] female), all completed follow-up. Death or BPD occurred in 105 infants (43.6%) in the MIST group and 121 (49.6%) in the control group (risk difference [RD], -6.3% [95% CI, -14.2% to 1.6%]; relative risk [RR], 0.87 [95% CI, 0.74 to 1.03]; P = .10). Incidence of death before 36 weeks' postmenstrual age did not differ significantly between groups (24 [10.0%] in MIST vs 19 [7.8%] in control; RD, 2.1% [95% CI, -3.6% to 7.8%]; RR, 1.27 [95% CI, 0.63 to 2.57]; P = .51), but incidence of BPD in survivors to 36 weeks' postmenstrual age was lower in the MIST group (81/217 [37.3%] vs 102/225 [45.3%] in the control group; RD, -7.8% [95% CI, -14.9% to -0.7%]; RR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.70 to 0.98]; P = .03). Serious adverse events occurred in 10.3% of infants in the MIST group and 11.1% in the control group.
Among preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome supported with CPAP, minimally invasive surfactant therapy compared with sham (control) treatment did not significantly reduce the incidence of the composite outcome of death or bronchopulmonary dysplasia at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age. However, given the statistical uncertainty reflected in the 95% CI, a clinically important effect cannot be excluded.

34879143,Effect of Use of a Bougie vs Endotracheal Tube With Stylet on Successful Intubation on the First Attempt Among Critically Ill Patients Undergoing Tracheal Intubation: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,[],JAMA,"For critically ill adults undergoing emergency tracheal intubation, failure to intubate the trachea on the first attempt occurs in up to 20% of cases and is associated with severe hypoxemia and cardiac arrest. Whether using a tracheal tube introducer (""bougie"") increases the likelihood of successful intubation compared with using an endotracheal tube with stylet remains uncertain.
To determine the effect of use of a bougie vs an endotracheal tube with stylet on successful intubation on the first attempt.
The Bougie or Stylet in Patients Undergoing Intubation Emergently (BOUGIE) trial was a multicenter, randomized clinical trial among 1102 critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation in 7 emergency departments and 8 intensive care units in the US between April 29, 2019, and February 14, 2021; the date of final follow-up was March 14, 2021.
Patients were randomly assigned to use of a bougie (n = 556) or use of an endotracheal tube with stylet (n = 546).
The primary outcome was successful intubation on the first attempt. The secondary outcome was the incidence of severe hypoxemia, defined as a peripheral oxygen saturation less than 80%.
Among 1106 patients randomized, 1102 (99.6%) completed the trial and were included in the primary analysis (median age, 58 years; 41.0% women). Successful intubation on the first attempt occurred in 447 patients (80.4%) in the bougie group and 453 patients (83.0%) in the stylet group (absolute risk difference, -2.6 percentage points [95% CI, -7.3 to 2.2]; P = .27). A total of 58 patients (11.0%) in the bougie group experienced severe hypoxemia, compared with 46 patients (8.8%) in the stylet group (absolute risk difference, 2.2 percentage points [95% CI, -1.6 to 6.0]). Esophageal intubation occurred in 4 patients (0.7%) in the bougie group and 5 patients (0.9%) in the stylet group, pneumothorax was present after intubation in 14 patients (2.5%) in the bougie group and 15 patients (2.7%) in the stylet group, and injury to oral, glottic, or thoracic structures occurred in 0 patients in the bougie group and 3 patients (0.5%) in the stylet group.
Among critically ill adults undergoing tracheal intubation, use of a bougie did not significantly increase the incidence of successful intubation on the first attempt compared with use of an endotracheal tube with stylet.

34877926,YouTube as a source of information on keratoconus: a social media analysis.,"['DISCERN score', 'YouTube', 'keratoconus', 'quality of YouTube videos']",Clinical & experimental optometry,"Keratoconus (KC) treatment in the early stage is usually with glasses or soft toric contact lenses, in advanced stages rigid gas-permeable corneal or scleral contact lenses are used. Optometrists should be aware of misleading information from online platforms when providing information to keratoconus patients.
Keratoconus is a progressive corneal disease characterised by stromal thinning and corneal ectasia. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study evaluating the popularity, quality, and reliability of videos about keratoconus disease and its treatment published on YouTube. In our study, we aimed to evaluate the credibility, quality, and popularity of YouTube videos about keratoconus.
This is a retrospective, cross-sectional, register-based study. A YouTube search was performed using the keywords 'keratoconus', 'keratoconus disease', 'keratoconus treatment', 'keratoconus cross linking'. The quality and reliability of video content were measured using the DISCERN questionnaire, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) score, and the Global Quality Score (GQS). The video power index was used to evaluate the popularity of the videos.
One hundred videos were included in the study. The average duration was 6.33 min and average total number of views was 14,940. The mean DISCERN, JAMA, and GQS scores were 42.57 ± 12.04 (intermediate quality), 1.77 ± 0.51 (poor quality), and 3.63 ± 1.03 (intermediate quality), respectively. The mean video power index was 11.02 ± 24.55 (range, 0-193). The DISCERN score was significantly positively correlated with GQS and JAMA scores (p ≤ 0.001).

34874420,Effects of Mediterranean Diet or Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction on Prevention of Small-for-Gestational Age Birth Weights in Newborns Born to At-Risk Pregnant Individuals: The IMPACT BCN Randomized Clinical Trial.,[],JAMA,"Being born small for gestational age (SGA) is a leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality with no effective prevention or therapy. Maternal suboptimal nutrition and high stress levels have been associated with poor fetal growth and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
To investigate whether structured interventions based on a Mediterranean diet or mindfulness-based stress reduction (stress reduction) in high-risk pregnancies can reduce the percentage of newborns who were born SGA and other adverse pregnancy outcomes.
Parallel-group randomized clinical trial conducted at a university hospital in Barcelona, Spain, including 1221 individuals with singleton pregnancies (19-23 weeks' gestation) at high risk for SGA. Enrollment took place from February 1, 2017, to October 10, 2019, with follow-up until delivery (final follow-up on March 1, 2020).
Participants in the Mediterranean diet group (n = 407) received 2 hours monthly of individual and group educational sessions and free provision of extra-virgin olive oil and walnuts. Individuals in the stress reduction group (n = 407) underwent an 8-week stress reduction program adapted for pregnancy, consisting of weekly 2.5-hour sessions and 1 full-day session. Individuals in the usual care group (n = 407) received pregnancy care per institutional protocols.
The primary end point was the percentage of newborns who were SGA at delivery, defined as birth weight below the 10th percentile. The secondary end point was a composite adverse perinatal outcome (at least 1 of the following: preterm birth, preeclampsia, perinatal mortality, severe SGA, neonatal acidosis, low Apgar score, or presence of any major neonatal morbidity).
Among the 1221 randomized individuals (median [IQR] age, 37 [34-40] years), 1184 (97%) completed the trial (392 individuals assigned to the Mediterranean diet group, 391 to the stress reduction group, and 401 to the usual care group). SGA occurred in 88 newborns (21.9%) in the control group, 55 (14.0%) in the Mediterranean diet group (odds ratio [OR], 0.58 [95% CI, 0.40-0.84]; risk difference [RD], -7.9 [95% CI, -13.6 to -2.6]; P = .004), and 61 (15.6%) in the stress reduction group (OR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.46-0.94]; RD, -6.3 [95% CI, -11.8 to -0.9]; P = .02). The composite adverse perinatal outcome occurred in 105 newborns (26.2%) in the control group, 73 (18.6%) in the Mediterranean diet group (OR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.46-0.90]; RD, -7.6 [95% CI, -13.4 to -1.8]; P = .01), and 76 (19.5%) in the stress reduction group (OR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.49-0.95]; RD, -6.8 [95% CI, -12.6 to -0.3]; P = .02).
In this randomized trial conducted at a single institution in Spain, treating pregnant individuals at high risk for SGA with a structured Mediterranean diet or with mindfulness-based stress reduction, compared with usual care, significantly reduced the percentage of newborns with birth weight below the 10th percentile. Due to important study limitations, these findings should be considered preliminary and require replication, as well as assessment in additional patient populations, before concluding that these treatments should be recommended to patients.

34874419,Effect of High-Flow Oxygen Therapy vs Conventional Oxygen Therapy on Invasive Mechanical Ventilation and Clinical Recovery in Patients With Severe COVID-19: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,[],JAMA,"The effect of high-flow oxygen therapy vs conventional oxygen therapy has not been established in the setting of severe COVID-19.
To determine the effect of high-flow oxygen therapy through a nasal cannula compared with conventional oxygen therapy on need for endotracheal intubation and clinical recovery in severe COVID-19.
Randomized, open-label clinical trial conducted in emergency and intensive care units in 3 hospitals in Colombia. A total of 220 adults with respiratory distress and a ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen of less than 200 due to COVID-19 were randomized from August 2020 to January 2021, with last follow-up on February 10, 2021.
Patients were randomly assigned to receive high-flow oxygen through a nasal cannula (n = 109) or conventional oxygen therapy (n = 111).
The co-primary outcomes were need for intubation and time to clinical recovery until day 28 as assessed by a 7-category ordinal scale (range, 1-7, with higher scores indicating a worse condition). Effects of treatments were calculated with a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for hypoxemia severity, age, and comorbidities.
Among 220 randomized patients, 199 were included in the analysis (median age, 60 years; n = 65 women [32.7%]). Intubation occurred in 34 (34.3%) randomized to high-flow oxygen therapy and in 51 (51.0%) randomized to conventional oxygen therapy (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.39-0.96; P = .03). The median time to clinical recovery within 28 days was 11 (IQR, 9-14) days in patients randomized to high-flow oxygen therapy vs 14 (IQR, 11-19) days in those randomized to conventional oxygen therapy (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00-1.92; P = .047). Suspected bacterial pneumonia occurred in 13 patients (13.1%) randomized to high-flow oxygen and in 17 (17.0%) of those randomized to conventional oxygen therapy, while bacteremia was detected in 7 (7.1%) vs 11 (11.0%), respectively.
Among patients with severe COVID-19, use of high-flow oxygen through a nasal cannula significantly decreased need for mechanical ventilation support and time to clinical recovery compared with conventional low-flow oxygen therapy.

34874418,Effect of a Diagnostic Strategy Using an Elevated and Age-Adjusted D-Dimer Threshold on Thromboembolic Events in Emergency Department Patients With Suspected Pulmonary Embolism: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,[],JAMA,"Uncontrolled studies suggest that pulmonary embolism (PE) can be safely ruled out using the YEARS rule, a diagnostic strategy that uses varying D-dimer thresholds.
To prospectively validate the safety of a strategy that combines the YEARS rule with the pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC) rule and an age-adjusted D-dimer threshold.
A cluster-randomized, crossover, noninferiority trial in 18 emergency departments (EDs) in France and Spain. Patients (N = 1414) who had a low clinical risk of PE not excluded by the PERC rule or a subjective clinical intermediate risk of PE were included from October 2019 to June 2020, and followed up until October 2020.
Each center was randomized for the sequence of intervention periods. In the intervention period (726 patients), PE was excluded without chest imaging in patients with no YEARS criteria and a D-dimer level less than 1000 ng/mL and in patients with 1 or more YEARS criteria and a D-dimer level less than the age-adjusted threshold (500 ng/mL if age <50 years or age in years × 10 in patients ≥50 years). In the control period (688 patients), PE was excluded without chest imaging if the D-dimer level was less than the age-adjusted threshold.
The primary end point was venous thromboembolism (VTE) at 3 months. The noninferiority margin was set at 1.35%. There were 8 secondary end points, including chest imaging, ED length of stay, hospital admission, nonindicated anticoagulation treatment, all-cause death, and all-cause readmission at 3 months.
Of the 1414 included patients (mean age, 55 years; 58% female), 1217 (86%) were analyzed in the per-protocol analysis. PE was diagnosed in the ED in 100 patients (7.1%). At 3 months, VTE was diagnosed in 1 patient in the intervention group (0.15% [95% CI, 0.0% to 0.86%]) vs 5 patients in the control group (0.80% [95% CI, 0.26% to 1.86%]) (adjusted difference, -0.64% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -∞ to 0.21%], within the noninferiority margin). Of the 6 analyzed secondary end points, only 2 showed a statistically significant difference in the intervention group compared with the control group: chest imaging (30.4% vs 40.0%; adjusted difference, -8.7% [95% CI, -13.8% to -3.5%]) and ED median length of stay (6 hours [IQR, 4 to 8 hours] vs 6 hours [IQR, 5 to 9 hours]; adjusted difference, -1.6 hours [95% CI, -2.3 to -0.9]).
Among ED patients with suspected PE, the use of the YEARS rule combined with the age-adjusted D-dimer threshold in PERC-positive patients, compared with a conventional diagnostic strategy, did not result in an inferior rate of thromboembolic events.

To update the 2014 review on dental caries screening and preventive interventions to inform the USPSTF.
Ovid MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (to September 2020); surveillance through July 23, 2021.
Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on screening, preventive interventions, referral to dental care; cohort studies on screening and referral; studies on diagnostic accuracy of primary care oral examination or risk assessment; and a systematic review on risk of fluorosis included in prior USPSTF reviews.
One investigator abstracted data; a second checked accuracy. Two investigators independently rated study quality.
Thirty-two studies (19 trials, 9 observational studies, and 4 nonrandomized clinical intervention studies [total 106 694 participants] and 1 systematic review [19 studies]) were included. No study evaluated effects of primary care screening on clinical outcomes. One study (n = 258) found primary care pediatrician examination associated with a sensitivity of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.55 to 0.91) and specificity of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.92 to 0.98) for identifying a child with cavities, and 1 study found a risk assessment tool associated with sensitivity of 0.53 and specificity of 0.77 (n = 697, CIs not reported) for a child with future caries. No new trials of dietary fluoride supplementation were identified. For prevention, topical fluoride compared with placebo or no topical fluoride was associated with decreased caries burden (13 trials, n = 5733; mean caries increment [difference in decayed, missing, and filled teeth or surfaces], -0.94 [95% CI, -1.74 to -0.34]) and likelihood of incident caries (12 trials, n = 8177; RR, 0.80 [95% CI, 0.66 to 0.95]; absolute risk difference, -7%) in higher-risk populations or settings, with no increased fluorosis risk. Evidence on other preventive interventions was limited (education, xylitol) or unavailable (silver diamine fluoride), and no study directly evaluated primary care dentistry referral vs no referral.
There was no direct evidence on benefits and harms of primary care oral health screening or referral to dentist.

34874412,Screening and Interventions to Prevent Dental Caries in Children Younger Than 5 Years: US Preventive Services Task Force Recommendation Statement.,[],JAMA,"Dental caries is the most common chronic disease in children in the US. According to the 2011-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, approximately 23% of children aged 2 to 5 years had dental caries in their primary teeth. Prevalence is higher in Mexican American children (33%) and non-Hispanic Black children (28%) than in non-Hispanic White children (18%). Dental caries in early childhood is associated with pain, loss of teeth, impaired growth, decreased weight gain, negative effects on quality of life, poor school performance, and future dental caries.
To update its 2014 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review on screening and interventions to prevent dental caries in children younger than 5 years.
Asymptomatic children younger than 5 years.
The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit of preventing future dental caries with oral fluoride supplementation at recommended doses in children 6 months or older whose water supply is deficient in fluoride. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that there is a moderate net benefit of preventing future dental caries with fluoride varnish application in all children younger than 5 years. The USPSTF concludes that the evidence is insufficient on performing routine oral screening examinations for dental caries by primary care clinicians in children younger than 5 years and that the balance of benefits and harms of screening cannot be determined.
The USPSTF recommends that primary care clinicians prescribe oral fluoride supplementation starting at age 6 months for children whose water supply is deficient in fluoride. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends that primary care clinicians apply fluoride varnish to the primary teeth of all infants and children starting at the age of primary tooth eruption. (B recommendation) The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of routine screening examinations for dental caries performed by primary care clinicians in children younger than 5 years.

34847226,Effect of Intravenous or Intraosseous Calcium vs Saline on Return of Spontaneous Circulation in Adults With Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,[],JAMA,"It is unclear whether administration of calcium has a beneficial effect in patients with cardiac arrest.
To determine whether administration of calcium during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest improves return of spontaneous circulation in adults.
This double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial included 397 adult patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and was conducted in the Central Denmark Region between January 20, 2020, and April 15, 2021. The last 90-day follow-up was on July 15, 2021.
The intervention consisted of up to 2 intravenous or intraosseous doses with 5 mmol of calcium chloride (n = 197) or saline (n = 200). The first dose was administered immediately after the first dose of epinephrine.
The primary outcome was sustained return of spontaneous circulation. The secondary outcomes included survival and a favorable neurological outcome (modified Rankin Scale score of 0-3) at 30 days and 90 days.
Based on a planned interim analysis of 383 patients, the steering committee stopped the trial early due to concerns about harm in the calcium group. Of 397 adult patients randomized, 391 were included in the analyses (193 in the calcium group and 198 in the saline group; mean age, 68 [SD, 14] years; 114 [29%] were female). There was no loss to follow-up. There were 37 patients (19%) in the calcium group who had sustained return of spontaneous circulation compared with 53 patients (27%) in the saline group (risk ratio, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.49 to 1.03]; risk difference, -7.6% [95% CI, -16% to 0.8%]; P = .09). At 30 days, 10 patients (5.2%) in the calcium group and 18 patients (9.1%) in the saline group were alive (risk ratio, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.27 to 1.18]; risk difference, -3.9% [95% CI, -9.4% to 1.3%]; P = .17). A favorable neurological outcome at 30 days was observed in 7 patients (3.6%) in the calcium group and in 15 patients (7.6%) in the saline group (risk ratio, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.20 to 1.12]; risk difference, -4.0% [95% CI, -8.9% to 0.7%]; P = .12). Among the patients with calcium values measured who had return of spontaneous circulation, 26 (74%) in the calcium group and 1 (2%) in the saline group had hypercalcemia.
Among adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, treatment with intravenous or intraosseous calcium compared with saline did not significantly improve sustained return of spontaneous circulation. These results do not support the administration of calcium during out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in adults.

34845552,What's Nissen on the net? the quality of information regarding Nissen fundoplication on the internet.,"['DISCERN tool', 'General surgery', 'HON code', 'JAMA Benchmark', 'Nissen fundoplication', 'Quality of Online information']",Surgical endoscopy,"More patients are turning to the internet for their health information than ever before. This is a growing problem as it is well recognized that medical information on the internet is highly variable. We assessed the quality of information on the internet regarding the anti-reflux procedure, Nissen Fundoplication. Three commonly used measures of website quality are the Health On the Net code, the Journal of the American Medical Association Benchmark criteria, and the DISCERN tool. The HON code is a seal of approval awarded by an independent organization where the JAMA Benchmark and DISCERN Tool are a set of standards that can be utilized by an internet user or webpage creator.
We performed a Google search using the term ""Nissen Fundoplication"", where we analyzed the top 75 websites. We included English language websites and excluded advertisements, websites for medical professionals, duplicates, and requiring a login. Each website included was evaluated for presence of the HON seal and scored with the JAMA Benchmark and DISCERN criteria to determine quality.
Only 16.28% of websites were found to be HON code certified. The average JAMA benchmark score was 1.23, with 9.3% websites scoring the maximum 4 points and 39.53% receiving a score of 0. The average DISCERN score was 34.65 out of a total possible score of 75, where the mean score for the overall quality of the website (question 16) was 2.19 out of a maximal score of 5.
This study, using 3 commonly used validated measures, has found that the quality of online information pertaining to Nissen Fundoplication is sorely lacking. The implications of these results are twofold as an important reference for institutions to update their source material and a guide when providing patients with adequate resources.","This study, using 3 commonly used validated measures, has found that the quality of online information pertaining to Nissen Fundoplication is sorely lacking.

34837580,A multivariate model for successful publication of intensive care medicine randomized controlled trials in the highest impact factor journals: the SCOTI score.,"['Critical care', 'Critically ill patients', 'Intensive care medicine', 'Intensive care unit', 'Precision medicine']",Annals of intensive care,"Critical care randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are often published in high-impact journals, whether general journals [the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), The Lancet, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)] or critical care journals [Intensive Care Medicine (ICM), the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (AJRCCM), Critical Care Medicine (CCM)]. As rejection occurs in up to 97% of cases, it might be appropriate to assess pre-submission probability of being published. The objective of this study was to develop and internally validate a simplified score predicting whether an ongoing trial stands a chance of being published in high-impact general journals.
A cohort of critical care RCTs published between 1999 and 2018 in the three highest impact medical journals (NEJM, The Lancet, JAMA) or the three highest impact critical care journals (ICM, AJRCCM, CCM) was split into two samples (derivation cohort, validation cohort) to develop and internally validate the simplified score. Primary outcome was journal of publication assessed as high-impact general journal (NEJM, The Lancet, JAMA) or critical care journal (ICM, AJRCCM, CCM).
A total of 968 critical care RCTs were included in the predictive cohort and split into a derivation cohort (n = 510) and a validation cohort (n = 458). In the derivation cohort, the sample size (P value < 0.001), the number of centers involved (P value = 0.01), mortality as primary outcome (P value = 0.002) or a composite item including mortality as primary outcome (P value = 0.004), and topic [ventilation (P value < 0.001) or miscellaneous (P value < 0.001)] were independent factors predictive of publication in high-impact general journals, compared to high-impact critical care journals. The SCOTI score (Sample size, Centers, Outcome, Topic, and International score) was developed with an area under the ROC curve of 0.84 (95% Confidence Interval, 0.80-0.88) in validation by split sample.

34812863,Effect of Intra-articular Platelet-Rich Plasma vs Placebo Injection on Pain and Medial Tibial Cartilage Volume in Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis: The RESTORE Randomized Clinical Trial.,[],JAMA,"Most clinical guidelines do not recommend platelet-rich plasma (PRP) for knee osteoarthritis (OA) because of lack of high-quality evidence on efficacy for symptoms and joint structure, but the guidelines emphasize the need for rigorous studies. Despite this, use of PRP in knee OA is increasing.
To evaluate the effects of intra-articular PRP injections on symptoms and joint structure in patients with symptomatic mild to moderate radiographic medial knee OA.
This randomized, 2-group, placebo-controlled, participant-, injector-, and assessor-blinded clinical trial enrolled community-based participants (n = 288) aged 50 years or older with symptomatic medial knee OA (Kellgren and Lawrence grade 2 or 3) in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, from August 24, 2017, to July 5, 2019. The 12-month follow-up was completed on July 22, 2020.
Interventions involved 3 intra-articular injections at weekly intervals of either leukocyte-poor PRP using a commercially available product (n = 144 participants) or saline placebo (n = 144 participants).
The 2 primary outcomes were 12-month change in overall average knee pain scores (11-point scale; range, 0-10, with higher scores indicating worse pain; minimum clinically important difference of 1.8) and percentage change in medial tibial cartilage volume as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Thirty-one secondary outcomes (25 symptom related and 6 MRI assessed; minimum clinically important difference not known) evaluated pain, function, quality of life, global change, and joint structures at 2-month and/or 12-month follow-up.
Among 288 patients who were randomized (mean age, 61.9 [SD, 6.5] years; 169 [59%] women), 269 (93%) completed the trial. In both groups, 140 participants (97%) received all 3 injections. After 12 months, treatment with PRP vs placebo injection resulted in a mean change in knee pain scores of -2.1 vs -1.8 points, respectively (difference, -0.4 [95% CI, -0.9 to 0.2] points; P = .17). The mean change in medial tibial cartilage volume was -1.4% vs -1.2%, respectively (difference, -0.2% [95% CI, -1.9% to 1.5%]; P = .81). Of 31 prespecified secondary outcomes, 29 showed no significant between-group differences.
Among patients with symptomatic mild to moderate radiographic knee OA, intra-articular injection of PRP, compared with injection of saline placebo, did not result in a significant difference in symptoms or joint structure at 12 months. These findings do not support use of PRP for the management of knee OA.

34812859,Management of Acne Vulgaris: A Review.,[],JAMA,"Acne vulgaris is an inflammatory disease of the pilosebaceous unit of the skin that primarily involves the face and trunk and affects approximately 9% of the population worldwide (approximately 85% of individuals aged 12-24 years, and approximately 50% of patients aged 20-29 years). Acne vulgaris can cause permanent physical scarring, negatively affect quality of life and self-image, and has been associated with increased rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation.
Acne vulgaris is classified based on patient age, lesion morphology (comedonal, inflammatory, mixed, nodulocystic), distribution (location on face, trunk, or both), and severity (extent, presence or absence of scarring, postinflammatory erythema, or hyperpigmentation). Although most acne does not require specific medical evaluation, medical workup is sometimes warranted. Topical therapies such as retinoids (eg, tretinoin, adapalene), benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, and/or combinations of topical agents are first-line treatments. When prescribed as a single therapy in a randomized trial of 207 patients, treatment with tretinoin 0.025% gel reduced acne lesion counts at 12 weeks by 63% compared with baseline. Combinations of topical agents with systemic agents (oral antibiotics such as doxycycline and minocycline, hormonal therapies such as combination oral contraception [COC] or spironolactone, or isotretinoin) are recommended for more severe disease. In a meta-analysis of 32 randomized clinical trials, COC was associated with reductions in inflammatory lesions by 62%, placebo was associated with a 26% reduction, and oral antibiotics were associated with a 58% reduction at 6-month follow-up. Isotretinoin is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treating severe recalcitrant nodular acne but is often used to treat resistant or persistent moderate to severe acne, as well as acne that produces scarring or significant psychosocial distress.
Acne vulgaris affects approximately 9% of the population worldwide and approximately 85% of those aged 12 to 24 years. First-line therapies are topical retinoids, benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid, or combinations of topicals. For more severe disease, oral antibiotics such as doxycycline or minocycline, hormonal therapies such as combination oral conceptive agents or spironolactone, or isotretinoin are most effective.",,,,,10.1001/jama.2021.17633,2021-11-24,"[{'lastname': 'Eichenfield', 'firstname': 'Dawn Z', 'initials': 'DZ', 'affiliation': ""Department of Dermatology, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla.\nDivision of Pediatric and Adolescent Dermatology, Rady Children's Hospital San Diego, San Diego, California.""}, {'lastname': 'Sprague', 'firstname': 'Jessica', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': ""Department of Dermatology, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla.\nDivision of Pediatric and Adolescent Dermatology, Rady Children's Hospital San Diego, San Diego, California.""}, {'lastname': 'Eichenfield', 'firstname': 'Lawrence F', 'initials': 'LF', 'affiliation': ""Department of Dermatology, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla.\nDivision of Pediatric and Adolescent Dermatology, Rady Children's Hospital San Diego, San Diego, California.\nDepartment of Pediatrics, University of California San Diego School of Medicine, La Jolla.""}]"

34809561,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on publication dynamics and non-COVID-19 research production.,"['COVID-19', 'High-impact journals', 'Meta-research', 'Publications']",BMC medical research methodology,"The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected health systems and medical research worldwide but its impact on the global publication dynamics and non-COVID-19 research has not been measured. We hypothesized that the COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted the scientific production of non-COVID-19 research.
We conducted a comprehensive meta-research on studies (original articles, research letters and case reports) published between 01/01/2019 and 01/01/2021 in 10 high-impact medical and infectious disease journals (New England Journal of Medicine, Lancet, Journal of the American Medical Association, Nature Medicine, British Medical Journal, Annals of Internal Medicine, Lancet Global Health, Lancet Public Health, Lancet Infectious Disease and Clinical Infectious Disease). For each publication, we recorded publication date, publication type, number of authors, whether the publication was related to COVID-19, whether the publication was based on a case series, and the number of patients included in the study if the publication was based on a case report or a case series. We estimated the publication dynamics with a locally estimated scatterplot smoothing method. A Natural Language Processing algorithm was designed to calculate the number of authors for each publication. We simulated the number of non-COVID-19 studies that could have been published during the pandemic by extrapolating the publication dynamics of 2019 to 2020, and comparing the expected number to the observed number of studies.
Among the 22,525 studies assessed, 6319 met the inclusion criteria, of which 1022 (16.2%) were related to COVID-19 research. A dramatic increase in the number of publications in general journals was observed from February to April 2020 from a weekly median number of publications of 4.0 (IQR: 2.8-5.5) to 19.5 (IQR: 15.8-24.8) (p < 0.001), followed afterwards by a pattern of stability with a weekly median number of publications of 10.0 (IQR: 6.0-14.0) until December 2020 (p = 0.045 in comparison with April). Two prototypical editorial strategies were found: 1) journals that maintained the volume of non-COVID-19 publications while integrating COVID-19 research and thus increased their overall scientific production, and 2) journals that decreased the volume of non-COVID-19 publications while integrating COVID-19 publications. We estimated using simulation models that the COVID pandemic was associated with a 18% decrease in the production of non-COVID-19 research. We also found a significant change of the publication type in COVID-19 research as compared with non-COVID-19 research illustrated by a decrease in the number of original articles, (47.9% in COVID-19 publications vs 71.3% in non-COVID-19 publications, p < 0.001). Last, COVID-19 publications showed a higher number of authors, especially for case reports with a median of 9.0 authors (IQR: 6.0-13.0) in COVID-19 publications, compared to a median of 4.0 authors (IQR: 3.0-6.0) in non-COVID-19 publications (p < 0.001).
In this meta-research gathering publications from high-impact medical journals, we have shown that the dramatic rise in COVID-19 publications was accompanied by a substantial decrease of non-COVID-19 research.

34799504,Readability and quality assessment of internet-based patient education materials related to deep vein thrombosis.,[],Blood coagulation & fibrinolysis : an international journal in haemostasis and thrombosis,"Access to health-related internet information has increased dramatically during the past decade. A significant proportion of this information has been demonstrated to be set at too high a level for general comprehension. The goal of this study was to evaluate the readability and quality of information available on the internet relating to deep vein thrombosis (DVT). A search for 'DVT' and 'Deep Vein Thrombosis' was performed on five most commonly accessed search engines. Top hundred websites were reviewed. Website authorship was classified. Each site was assessed using the recognized quality and readability scoring systems. The presence of the health on the net foundation code of conduct (HON-code), a reported quality-assurance marker, was noted. The majority of web sites (45%) were academic or physician compiled. Only 36% of the websites were HON-code certified. HON-code certified sites achieved significantly greater DISCERN and Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) scores. Seventy-three percent of the websites were above the recommended sixth-grade readability level. Flesch--Kincaid readability test (FRES) of more than half of the websites (56%) was below 60, which makes them fairly difficult to read by general public. Internet information relating to DVT is of variable quality and largely set at an inappropriate readability level. Given this variability in quality, healthcare providers should direct patients to known sources of reliable, readable online information. Identification of reliable sources may be aided by known markers of quality such as HONcode certification and to educate them to use academic and physician-provided sites which have been shown to contain better-quality information. Moreover, academic and physician-compiled websites should be written in a fashion appropriate for general public consumption.",,,,"Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Poor quality or inaccurate resources may be harmful if they are trusted by providers. This study aimed to analyze the quality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related intubation videos on YouTube.
The term ""COVID-19 intubation"" was searched on YouTube. The top 100 videos retrieved were sorted by relevance and 37 videos were included. The video demographics were recorded. The quality of the videos was analyzed using an 18-point checklist, which was designed for evaluating COVID-19 intubation. Videos were also evaluated using general video quality scores and the modified Journal of the American Medical Association score.
The educational quality was graded as good for eight (21.6%) videos, moderate for 13 (35.1%) videos, and poor for 16 (43.2%) videos. The median safe COVID-19 intubation score (SCIS) was 11 (IQR = 5-13). The SCISs indicated that videos prepared in an intensive care unit were higher in quality than videos from other sources (p < 0.05). The length of the video was predictive of quality (area under the curve = 0.802, 95% CI = 0.658-0.945, p = 0.10).

34783839,Effect of Sacubitril/Valsartan vs Standard Medical Therapies on Plasma NT-proBNP Concentration and Submaximal Exercise Capacity in Patients With Heart Failure and Preserved Ejection Fraction: The PARALLAX Randomized Clinical Trial.,[],JAMA,"There is limited evidence on the benefits of sacubitril/valsartan vs broader renin angiotensin system inhibitor background therapy on surrogate outcome markers, 6-minute walk distance, and quality of life in patients with heart failure and mildly reduced or preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF >40%).
To evaluate the effect of sacubitril/valsartan on N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels, 6-minute walk distance, and quality of life vs background medication-based individualized comparators in patients with chronic heart failure and LVEF of more than 40%.
A 24-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel group clinical trial (August 2017-October 2019). Of 4632 patients screened at 396 centers in 32 countries, 2572 patients with heart failure, LVEF of more than 40%, elevated NT-proBNP levels, structural heart disease, and reduced quality of life were enrolled (last follow-up, October 28, 2019).
Patients were randomized 1:1 either to sacubitril/valsartan (n = 1286) or to background medication-based individualized comparator (n = 1286), ie, enalapril, valsartan, or placebo stratified by prior use of a renin angiotensin system inhibitor.
Primary end points were change from baseline in plasma NT-proBNP level at week 12 and in the 6-minute walk distance at week 24. Secondary end points were change from baseline in quality of life measures and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class at 24 weeks.
Among 2572 randomized patients (mean age, 72.6 years [SD, 8.5 years]; 1301 women [50.7%]), 2240 (87.1%) completed the trial. At baseline, the median NT-proBNP levels were 786 pg/mL in the sacubitril/valsartan group and 760 pg/mL in the comparator group. After 12 weeks, patients in the sacubitril/valsartan group (adjusted geometric mean ratio to baseline, 0.82 pg/mL) had a significantly greater reduction in NT-proBNP levels than did those in the comparator group (adjusted geometric mean ratio to baseline, 0.98 pg/mL) with an adjusted geometric mean ratio of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.80 to 0.88; P < .001). At week 24, there was no significant between-group difference in median change from baseline in the 6-minute walk distance with an increase of 9.7 m vs 12.2 m (adjusted mean difference, -2.5 m; 95% CI, -8.5 to 3.5; P = .42). There was no significant between-group difference in the mean change in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire clinical summary score (12.3 vs 11.8; mean difference, 0.52; 95% CI, -0.93 to 1.97) or improvement in NYHA class (23.6% vs 24.0% of patients; adjusted odds ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.18). The most frequent adverse events in the sacubitril/valsartan group vs the comparator group were hypotension (14.1% vs 5.5%), albuminuria (12.3% vs 7.6%), and hyperkalemia (11.6% vs 10.9%).
Among patients with heart failure and left ventricular ejection factor of higher than 40%, sacubitril/valsartan treatment compared with standard renin angiotensin system inhibitor treatment or placebo resulted in a significantly greater decrease in plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels at 12 weeks but did not significantly improve 6-minute walk distance at 24 weeks. Further research is warranted to evaluate potential clinical benefits of sacubitril/valsartan in these patients.

34762106,Association of Bariatric Surgery With Major Adverse Liver and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients With Biopsy-Proven Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.,[],JAMA,"No therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of serious adverse outcomes in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
To investigate the long-term relationship between bariatric surgery and incident major adverse liver outcomes and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with obesity and biopsy-proven fibrotic NASH without cirrhosis.
In the SPLENDOR (Surgical Procedures and Long-term Effectiveness in NASH Disease and Obesity Risk) study, of 25 828 liver biopsies performed at a US health system between 2004 and 2016, 1158 adult patients with obesity were identified who fulfilled enrollment criteria, including confirmed histological diagnosis of NASH and presence of liver fibrosis (histological stages 1-3). Baseline clinical characteristics, histological disease activity, and fibrosis stage of patients who underwent simultaneous liver biopsy at the time of bariatric surgery were balanced with a nonsurgical control group using overlap weighting methods. Follow-up ended in March 2021.
Bariatric surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy) vs nonsurgical care.
The primary outcomes were the incidence of major adverse liver outcomes (progression to clinical or histological cirrhosis, development of hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation, or liver-related mortality) and MACE (a composite of coronary artery events, cerebrovascular events, heart failure, or cardiovascular death), estimated using the Firth penalized method in a multivariable-adjusted Cox regression analysis framework.
A total of 1158 patients (740 [63.9%] women; median age, 49.8 years [IQR, 40.9-57.9 years], median body mass index, 44.1 [IQR, 39.4-51.4]), including 650 patients who underwent bariatric surgery and 508 patients in the nonsurgical control group, with a median follow-up of 7 years (IQR, 4-10 years) were analyzed. Distribution of baseline covariates, including histological severity of liver injury, was well-balanced after overlap weighting. At the end of the study period in the unweighted data set, 5 patients in the bariatric surgery group and 40 patients in the nonsurgical control group experienced major adverse liver outcomes, and 39 patients in the bariatric surgery group and 60 patients in the nonsurgical group experienced MACE. Among the patients analyzed with overlap weighting methods, the cumulative incidence of major adverse liver outcomes at 10 years was 2.3% (95% CI, 0%-4.6%) in the bariatric surgery group and 9.6% (95% CI, 6.1%-12.9%) in the nonsurgical group (adjusted absolute risk difference, 12.4% [95% CI, 5.7%-19.7%]; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.12 [95% CI, 0.02-0.63]; P = .01). The cumulative incidence of MACE at 10 years was 8.5% (95% CI, 5.5%-11.4%) in the bariatric surgery group and 15.7% (95% CI, 11.3%-19.8%) in the nonsurgical group (adjusted absolute risk difference, 13.9% [95% CI, 5.9%-21.9%]; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.30 [95% CI, 0.12-0.72]; P = .007). Within the first year after bariatric surgery, 4 patients (0.6%) died from surgical complications, including gastrointestinal leak (n = 2) and respiratory failure (n = 2).

With the increase in diversity in medical school and the growing list of subspecialties in medicine, we would expect to see a rise in diversity in the field of anesthesiology. The purpose of this study is to analyze the representation of gender and underrepresented minorities in anesthesiology residency programs from 2013 through 2019.
To study the ethnic, racial and gender diversity in residents in the field of anesthesiology, data was analyzed from the self-reported data collected in the Journal of the American Medical Association annual report on Graduate Medical Education over the academic period from 2013 through 2019.
In 2013, female trainees made up 36.0% and Black trainees encompassed 5.9% whereas in 2019, female trainees comprised a mere 33.0% of total anesthesiology residents while Black trainees decreased to 5.5%.

34751709,"Association of Participation in the Oncology Care Model With Medicare Payments, Utilization, Care Delivery, and Quality Outcomes.",[],JAMA,"In 2016, the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services initiated the Oncology Care Model (OCM), an alternative payment model designed to improve the value of care delivered to Medicare beneficiaries with cancer.
To assess the association of the OCM with changes in Medicare spending, utilization, quality, and patient experience during the OCM's first 3 years.
Exploratory difference-in-differences study comparing care during 6-month chemotherapy episodes in OCM participating practices and propensity-matched comparison practices initiated before (January 2014 through June 2015) and after (July 2016 through December 2018) the start of the OCM. Participants included Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with cancer treated at these practices through June 2019.
OCM participation.
Total episode payments (Medicare spending for Parts A, B, and D, not including monthly payments for enhanced oncology services); utilization and payments for hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) visits, office visits, chemotherapy, supportive care, and imaging; quality (chemotherapy-associated hospitalizations and ED visits, timely chemotherapy, end-of-life care, and survival); and patient experiences.
Among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, 483 319 beneficiaries (mean age, 73.0 [SD, 8.7] years; 60.1% women; 987 332 episodes) were treated at 201 OCM participating practices, and 557 354 beneficiaries (mean age, 72.9 [SD, 9.0] years; 57.4% women; 1 122 597 episodes) were treated at 534 comparison practices. From the baseline period, total episode payments increased from $28 681 for OCM episodes and $28 421 for comparison episodes to $33 211 for OCM episodes and $33 249 for comparison episodes during the intervention period (difference in differences, -$297; 90% CI, -$504 to -$91), less than the mean $704 Monthly Enhanced Oncology Services payments. Relative decreases in total episode payments were primarily for Part B nonchemotherapy drug payments (difference in differences, -$145; 90% CI, -$218 to -$72), especially supportive care drugs (difference in differences, -$150; 90% CI, -$216 to -$84). The OCM was associated with statistically significant relative reductions in total episode payments among higher-risk episodes (difference in differences, -$503; 90% CI, -$802 to -$204) and statistically significant relative increases in total episode payments among lower-risk episodes (difference in differences, $151; 90% CI, $39-$264). The OCM was not significantly associated with differences in hospitalizations, ED visits, or survival.

In this exploratory analysis, the OCM was significantly associated with modest payment reductions during 6-month episodes for Medicare beneficiaries receiving chemotherapy for cancer in the first 3 years of the OCM that did not offset the monthly payments for enhanced oncology services.

34751708,Association of Mental Stress-Induced Myocardial Ischemia With Cardiovascular Events in Patients With Coronary Heart Disease.,[],JAMA,"Mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia is a recognized phenomenon in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), but its clinical significance in the contemporary clinical era has not been investigated.
To compare the association of mental stress-induced or conventional stress-induced ischemia with adverse cardiovascular events in patients with CHD.
Pooled analysis of 2 prospective cohort studies of patients with stable CHD from a university-based hospital network in Atlanta, Georgia: the Mental Stress Ischemia Prognosis Study (MIPS) and the Myocardial Infarction and Mental Stress Study 2 (MIMS2). Participants were enrolled between June 2011 and March 2016 (last follow-up, February 2020).
Provocation of myocardial ischemia with a standardized mental stress test (public speaking task) and with a conventional (exercise or pharmacological) stress test, using single-photon emission computed tomography.
The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death or first or recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction. The secondary end point additionally included hospitalizations for heart failure.
Of the 918 patients in the total sample pool (mean age, 60 years; 34% women), 618 participated in MIPS and 300 in MIMS2. Of those, 147 patients (16%) had mental stress-induced ischemia, 281 (31%) conventional stress ischemia, and 96 (10%) had both. Over a 5-year median follow-up, the primary end point occurred in 156 participants. The pooled event rate was 6.9 per 100 patient-years among patients with and 2.6 per 100 patient-years among patients without mental stress-induced ischemia. The multivariable adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for patients with vs those without mental stress-induced ischemia was 2.5 (95% CI, 1.8-3.5). Compared with patients with no ischemia (event rate, 2.3 per 100 patient-years), patients with mental stress-induced ischemia alone had a significantly increased risk (event rate, 4.8 per 100 patient-years; HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.7) as did patients with both mental stress ischemia and conventional stress ischemia (event rate, 8.1 per 100 patient-years; HR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.6-5.6). Patients with conventional stress ischemia alone did not have a significantly increased risk (event rate, 3.1 per 100 patient-years; HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.9-2.1). Patients with both mental stress ischemia and conventional stress ischemia had an elevated risk compared with patients with conventional stress ischemia alone (HR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.7-4.3). The secondary end point occurred in 319 participants. The event rate was 12.6 per 100 patient-years for patients with and 5.6 per 100 patient-years for patients without mental stress-induced ischemia (adjusted HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.5-2.5).
Among patients with stable coronary heart disease, the presence of mental stress-induced ischemia, compared with no mental stress-induced ischemia, was significantly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Although these findings may provide insights into mechanisms of myocardial ischemia, further research is needed to assess whether testing for mental stress-induced ischemia has clinical

34751704,Cardiogenic Shock After Acute Myocardial Infarction: A Review.,[],JAMA,"Cardiogenic shock affects between 40 000 and 50 000 people in the US per year and is the leading cause of in-hospital mortality following acute myocardial infarction.
Thirty-day mortality for patients with cardiogenic shock due to myocardial infarction is approximately 40%, and 1-year mortality approaches 50%. Immediate revascularization of the infarct-related coronary artery remains the only treatment for cardiogenic shock associated with acute myocardial infarction supported by randomized clinical trials. The Percutaneous Coronary Intervention Strategies with Acute Myocardial Infarction and Cardiogenic Shock (CULPRIT-SHOCK) clinical trial demonstrated a reduction in the primary outcome of 30-day death or kidney replacement therapy; 158 of 344 patients (45.9%) in the culprit lesion revascularization-only group compared with 189 of 341 patients (55.4%) in the multivessel percutaneous coronary intervention group (relative risk, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.71-0.96]; P = .01). Despite a lack of randomized trials demonstrating benefit, percutaneous mechanical circulatory support devices are frequently used to manage cardiogenic shock following acute myocardial infarction.
Cardiogenic shock occurs in up to 10% of patients immediately following acute myocardial infarction and is associated with mortality rates of nearly 40% at 30 days and 50% at 1 year. Current evidence and clinical practice guidelines support immediate revascularization of the infarct-related coronary artery as the primary therapy for cardiogenic shock following acute myocardial infarction.",,,,,10.1001/jama.2021.18323,2021-11-10,"[{'lastname': 'Samsky', 'firstname': 'Marc D', 'initials': 'MD', 'affiliation': 'Duke Clinical Research Institute, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina.'}, {'lastname': 'Morrow', 'firstname': 'David A', 'initials': 'DA', 'affiliation': ""TIMI Study Group, Cardiovascular Division, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.""}, {'lastname': 'Proudfoot', 'firstname': 'Alastair G', 'initials': 'AG', 'affiliation': ""Perioperative Medicine Department, Barts Heart Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, United Kingdom.\nClinic For Anesthesiology & Intensive Care, Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin corporate member of Free University Berlin and Humboldt University Berlin, Germany.\nDepartment of Anaesthesiology & Intensive Care, German Heart Centre Berlin, Germany.""}, {'lastname': 'Hochman', 'firstname': 'Judith S', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'Cardiovascular Clinical Research Center, Division of Cardiology, Department of Medicine, NYU Grossman School of Medicine, New York, New York.'}, {'lastname': 'Thiele', 'firstname': 'Holger', 'initials': 'H', 'affiliation': 'Department of Internal Medicine/Cardiology, Leipzig Heart Institute, Heart Center Leipzig at University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.'}, {'lastname': 'Rao', 'firstname': 'Sunil V', 'initials': 'SV', 'affiliation': 'Duke Clinical Research Institute, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, North Carolina.'}]"

34747987,Addressing Racism in Preventive Services: Methods Report to Support the US Preventive Services Task Force.,[],JAMA,"In January 2021, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issued a values statement that acknowledged systemic racism and included a commitment to address racism and health equity in recommendations for clinical preventive services.
To articulate the definitional and conceptual issues around racism and health inequity and to describe how racism and health inequities are currently addressed in preventive health.
An audit was conducted assessing (1) published literature on frameworks or policy and position statements addressing racism, (2) a subset of cancer and cardiovascular topics in USPSTF reports, (3) recent systematic reviews on interventions to reduce health inequities in preventive health or to prevent racism in health care, and (4) health care-relevant professional societies, guideline-making organizations, agencies, and funding bodies to gather information about how they are addressing racism and health equity.
Race as a social category does not have biological underpinnings but has biological consequences through racism. Racism is complex and pervasive, operates at multiple interrelated levels, and exerts negative effects on other social determinants and health and well-being through multiple pathways. In its reports, the USPSTF has addressed racial and ethnic disparities, but not racism explicitly. The systematic reviews to support the USPSTF include interventions that may mitigate health disparities through cultural tailoring of behavioral interventions, but reviews have not explicitly addressed other commonly studied interventions to increase the uptake of preventive services or foster the implementation of preventive services. Many organizations have issued recent statements and commitments around racism in health care, but few have provided substantive guidance on operational steps to address the effects of racism. Where guidance is unavailable regarding the proposed actions, it is principally because work to achieve them is in very early stages. The most directly relevant and immediately useful guidance identified is that from the GRADE working group.
This methods report provides a summary of issues around racism and health inequity, including the status of how these are being addressed in preventive health.",,,,,10.1001/jama.2021.17579,2021-11-09,"[{'lastname': 'Lin', 'firstname': 'Jennifer S', 'initials': 'JS', 'affiliation': 'Kaiser Permanente Evidence-based Practice Center, Center for Health Research, Kaiser Permanente, Portland, Oregon.'}, {'lastname': 'Hoffman', 'firstname': 'Lynn', 'initials': 'L', 'affiliation': 'Abt Associates, Cambridge, Massachusetts.'}, {'lastname': 'Bean', 'firstname': 'Sarah I', 'initials': 'SI', 'affiliation': 'Kaiser Permanente Evidence-based Practice Center, Center for Health Research, Kaiser Permanente, Portland, Oregon.'}, {'lastname': ""O'Connor"", 'firstname': 'Elizabeth A', 'initials': 'EA', 'affiliation': 'Kaiser Permanente Evidence-based Practice Center, Center for Health Research, Kaiser Permanente, Portland, Oregon.'}, {'lastname': 'Martin', 'firstname': 'Allea M', 'initials': 'AM', 'affiliation': 'Kaiser Permanente Evidence-based Practice Center, Center for Health Research, Kaiser Permanente, Portland, Oregon.'}, {'lastname': 'Iacocca', 'firstname': 'Megan O', 'initials': 'MO', 'affiliation': 'Kaiser Permanente Evidence-based Practice Center, Center for Health Research, Kaiser Permanente, Portland, Oregon.'}, {'lastname': 'Bacon', 'firstname': 'Olivia P', 'initials': 'OP', 'affiliation': 'Abt Associates, Cambridge, Massachusetts.'}, {'lastname': 'Davies', 'firstname': 'Melinda C', 'initials': 'MC', 'affiliation': 'Kaiser Permanente Evidence-based Practice Center, Center for Health Research, Kaiser Permanente, Portland, Oregon.'}]"

To propose iterative changes to US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) processes, methods, and recommendations and enact a commitment to eliminate health inequities for people affected by systemic racism.
In February 2021, the USPSTF began operational steps in its work to create preventive care recommendations to address the harmful effects of racism. A commissioned methods report was conducted to inform this process. Key findings of the report informed proposed updates to the USPSTF methods to address populations adversely affected by systemic racism and proposed pilots on implementation of the proposed changes.
The USPSTF proposes to consider the opportunity to reduce health inequities when selecting new preventive care topics and prioritizing current topics; seek evidence about the effects of systemic racism and health inequities in all research plans and public comments requested, and integrate available evidence into evidence reviews; and summarize the likely effects of systemic racism and health inequities on clinical preventive services in USPSTF recommendations. The USPSTF will elicit feedback from its partners and experts and proposed changes will be piloted on selected USPSTF topics.

To evaluate the association between vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines-mRNA-1273 (Moderna) and BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech)-and COVID-19 hospitalization, and, among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the association with progression to critical disease.
A US 21-site case-control analysis of 4513 adults hospitalized between March 11 and August 15, 2021, with 28-day outcome data on death and mechanical ventilation available for patients enrolled through July 14, 2021. Date of final follow-up was August 8, 2021.
COVID-19 vaccination.
Associations were evaluated between prior vaccination and (1) hospitalization for COVID-19, in which case patients were those hospitalized for COVID-19 and control patients were those hospitalized for an alternative diagnosis; and (2) disease progression among patients hospitalized for COVID-19, in which cases and controls were COVID-19 patients with and without progression to death or mechanical ventilation, respectively. Associations were measured with multivariable logistic regression.
Among 4513 patients (median age, 59 years [IQR, 45-69]; 2202 [48.8%] women; 23.0% non-Hispanic Black individuals, 15.9% Hispanic individuals, and 20.1% with an immunocompromising condition), 1983 were case patients with COVID-19 and 2530 were controls without COVID-19. Unvaccinated patients accounted for 84.2% (1669/1983) of COVID-19 hospitalizations. Hospitalization for COVID-19 was significantly associated with decreased likelihood of vaccination (cases, 15.8%; controls, 54.8%; adjusted OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.13-0.18), including for sequenced SARS-CoV-2 Alpha (8.7% vs 51.7%; aOR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.06-0.16) and Delta variants (21.9% vs 61.8%; aOR, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.10-0.21). This association was stronger for immunocompetent patients (11.2% vs 53.5%; aOR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.09-0.13) than immunocompromised patients (40.1% vs 58.8%; aOR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.35-0.69) (P < .001) and weaker at more than 120 days since vaccination with BNT162b2 (5.8% vs 11.5%; aOR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.27-0.49) than with mRNA-1273 (1.9% vs 8.3%; aOR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.09-0.23) (P < .001). Among 1197 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, death or invasive mechanical ventilation by day 28 was associated with decreased likelihood of vaccination (12.0% vs 24.7%; aOR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.19-0.58).
Vaccination with an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine was significantly less likely among patients with COVID-19 hospitalization and disease progression to death or mechanical ventilation. These findings are consistent with risk reduction among vaccine breakthrough infections compared with absence of vaccination.",,,,,10.1001/jama.2021.19499,2021-11-05,"[{'lastname': 'Tenforde',

34726709,Association of Maternal Antidepressant Prescription During Pregnancy With Standardized Test Scores of Danish School-aged Children.,[],JAMA,"Concerns exist about long-term neurodevelopmental consequences of prenatal exposure to antidepressants.
To evaluate whether maternal prescription fill for antidepressants in pregnancy was associated with performance in standardized tests among Danish schoolchildren.
Population-based retrospective cohort study of children born in Denmark between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 2009, attending public primary and lower secondary school. The children included had completed a language or mathematics test as part of the Danish National Test Program between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2018. The age range of the eligible schoolchildren was 7 to 17 years.
Maternal prescription fill for antidepressants during pregnancy, obtained from the Danish Prescription Register.
The difference in standardized scores between children with and without maternal prescription fill for antidepressants in mathematics and language tests (scale, 1-100; higher scores indicate better test results) was estimated using linear regression models, adjusted for relevant confounders. Ten sensitivity analyses were performed, including a sibling-controlled analysis.
Among the 575 369 children included (51.1% males), 10 198 (1.8%) were born to mothers filling an antidepressant prescription during pregnancy. The mean (SD) age of children at the time of testing spanned from 8.9 (0.4) years in grade 2 to 14.9 (0.4) years in grade 8. Maternal prescription fill for antidepressants was significantly associated with a poorer performance in mathematics (mean test scores for the group exposed to maternal antidepressant fill: 52.1 [95% CI, 51.7-52.6] and for the group not exposed to maternal antidepressant fill: 57.4 [95% CI, 57.3-57.4]; adjusted difference, -2.2 [95% CI, -2.7 to -1.6]), but not in language (mean test scores for the exposed group: 53.4 [95% CI, 53.1-53.7] and for the not exposed group: 56.6 [95% CI, 56.5-56.6]; adjusted difference, -0.1 [95% CI, -0.6 to 0.3]). In the sibling-controlled analysis, the adjusted difference in mathematics (mean scores for the exposed group: 53.5 [95% CI, 52.7-54.3] and for the not exposed group: 59.0 [95% CI, 58.9-59.1]) was -2.8 (95% CI, -4.5 to -1.2) and in language (mean test scores for the exposed group: 53.9 [95% CI, 53.2-54.6] and for the not exposed group: 56.6 [95% CI, 56.5-56.7]) was -0.3 (95% CI, -1.9 to 1.2).
In this study of public schoolchildren in Denmark, children whose mothers had filled prescriptions for antidepressants during pregnancy, compared with children whose mothers did not fill prescriptions for antidepressants during pregnancy, had a 2-point lower standardized test score in mathematics, a difference that was statistically significant, but had no significant difference in language test scores. The magnitude of the difference in the mathematics test score was small and of uncertain clinical importance, and the findings must be weighed against the benefits of treating maternal depression during pregnancy.",,,,,10.1001/jama.2021.17380,2021-11-03,"[{'lastname': 'Christensen', 'firstname': 'Jakob', 'initials': 'J', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Register-Based Research, Department of Economics and Business Economics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.\nDepartment of Neurology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Trabjerg', 'firstname': 'Betina B', 'initials': 'BB', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Register-Based Research, Department of Economics and Business Economics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.\nCentre for Integrated Register-based Research (CIRRAU), Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Sun', 'firstname': 'Yuelian', 'initials': 'Y', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Register-Based Research, Department of Economics and Business Economics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.\nDepartment of Neurology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.'}, {'lastname': 'Dreier', 'firstname': 'Julie Werenberg', 'initials': 'JW', 'affiliation': 'National Centre for Register-Based Research, Department of Economics and Business Economics, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.\nCentre for Integrated Register-based Research (CIRRAU), Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.'}]"
34726708,Effect of Amoxicillin Dose and Treatment Duration on the Need for Antibiotic Re-treatment in Children With Community-Acquired Pneumonia: The CAP-IT Randomized Clinical Trial.,[],JAMA,"The optimal dose and duration of oral amoxicillin for children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) are unclear.
To determine whether lower-dose amoxicillin is noninferior to higher dose and whether 3-day treatment is noninferior to 7 days.
Multicenter, randomized, 2 × 2 factorial noninferiority trial enrolling 824 children, aged 6 months and older, with clinically diagnosed CAP, treated with amoxicillin on discharge from emergency departments and inpatient wards of 28 hospitals in the UK and 1 in Ireland between February 2017 and April 2019, with last trial visit on May 21, 2019.
Children were randomized 1:1 to receive oral amoxicillin at a lower dose (35-50 mg/kg/d; n = 410) or higher dose (70-90 mg/kg/d; n = 404), for a shorter duration (3 days; n = 413) or a longer duration (7 days; n = 401).
The primary outcome was clinically indicated antibiotic re-treatment for respiratory infection within 28 days after randomization. The noninferiority margin was 8%. Secondary outcomes included severity/duration of 9 parent-reported CAP symptoms, 3 antibiotic-related adverse events, and phenotypic resistance in colonizing Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates.
Of 824 participants randomized into 1 of the 4 groups, 814 received at least 1 dose of trial medication (median [IQR] age, 2.5 years [1.6-2.7]; 421 [52%] males and 393 [48%] females), and the primary outcome was available for 789 (97%). For lower vs higher dose, the primary outcome occurred in 12.6% with lower dose vs 12.4% with higher dose (difference, 0.2% [1-sided 95% CI -∞ to 4.0%]), and in 12.5% with 3-day treatment vs 12.5% with 7-day treatment (difference, 0.1% [1-sided 95% CI -∞ to 3.9]). Both groups demonstrated noninferiority with no significant interaction between dose and duration (P = .63). Of the 14 prespecified secondary end points, the only significant differences were 3-day vs 7-day treatment for cough duration (median 12 days vs 10 days; hazard ratio [HR], 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4]; P = .04) and sleep disturbed by cough (median, 4 days vs 4 days; HR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4]; P = .03). Among the subgroup of children with severe CAP, the primary end point occurred in 17.3% of lower-dose recipients vs 13.5% of higher-dose recipients (difference, 3.8% [1-sided 95% CI, -∞ to10%]; P value for interaction = .18) and in 16.0% with 3-day treatment vs 14.8% with 7-day treatment (difference, 1.2% [1-sided 95% CI, -∞ to 7.4%]; P value for interaction = .73).
