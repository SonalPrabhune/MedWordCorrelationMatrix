"In earlier work, we explored the SAR for the C3 side chain pharmacophore in the hexahydrocannabinol template represented by the drug nabilone, which resulted in the development of AM2389. In an effort for further optimization, we have merged features of nabilone and AM2389 and explored the C3 side chain with varying chain lengths and terminal substitutions. Of the compounds described here, a nabilone analog, AM8936, with the C6'-cyano-substituted side chain, was identified as the most successful analog capable of serving as a potential candidate for further development and a valuable tool for further in vivo studies. AM8936 behaved as a balanced and potent CB1 agonist in functional assays and was a potent and efficacious CB1 agonist in vivo. Our SAR studies are highlighted with the docking of AM8936 on the crystal structure of the hCB1 receptor.","['c3 side chain pharmacophore', 'c3 side chain', 'substituted side chain', 'varying chain lengths', 'hexahydrocannabinol template represented', 'efficacious cb1 agonist', ""c6 '- cyano"", 'successful analog capable', 'potent cb1 agonist', 'nabilone analog', 'valuable tool', 'terminal substitutions', 'potential candidate', 'merged features', 'hcb1 receptor', 'functional assays', 'earlier work', 'crystal structure', 'compounds described', 'drug nabilone', 'vivo studies', 'sar studies', 'am8936 behaved', 'potent', 'nabilone', 'vivo', 'sar', 'am8936', 'am8936', 'serving', 'resulted', 'optimization', 'identified', 'highlighted', 'explored', 'explored', 'effort', 'docking', 'development', 'development', 'balanced', 'am2389', 'am2389']"

"To improve the visualization and potency of anticancer agents, the diagnosis and treatment integration bi-functional molecules were constructed based on active candidate BD7, approved drug Linifanib, and monoclonal antibody Bevacizumab. Commercial available Rhodamine B was inducted to realize imaging-aided diagnosis and target efficiency monitoring for cancer cells. In order to maintain the anticancer activity of drugs, disulfide bond was incorporated as releasable group based on tumor microenviroment. After design, synthesis and structure characterization of title compounds, various biological evaluation and cancer cell imaging analysis were carried out. The results indicated that these title diagnosis and treatment integration bi-functional molecules exhibited comparable potency with that of corresponding parent drug. Meanwhile, these agents afforded good performance in cell imaging and could be used to differentiate cancer cells from normal ovarian cells in real time. Further optimization of these bi-functional molecules is ongoing to improve the potency and precision and will be reported in due course. Our findings are expected to achieve efficient screening and real-time prognostic monitoring under the premise of high anti-tumor activity for clinical application.","['functional molecules exhibited comparable potency', 'commercial available rhodamine b', 'agents afforded good performance', 'cancer cell imaging analysis', 'various biological evaluation', 'target efficiency monitoring', 'monoclonal antibody bevacizumab', 'corresponding parent drug', 'approved drug linifanib', 'active candidate bd7', 'achieve efficient screening', 'normal ovarian cells', 'differentiate cancer cells', 'time prognostic monitoring', 'releasable group based', 'treatment integration bi', 'treatment integration bi', 'functional molecules', 'functional molecules', 'cell imaging', 'cancer cells', 'anticancer agents', 'realize imaging', 'constructed based', 'tumor microenviroment', 'tumor activity', 'title compounds', 'structure characterization', 'results indicated', 'real time', 'high anti', 'due course', 'disulfide bond', 'clinical application', 'anticancer activity', 'title diagnosis', 'aided diagnosis', 'potency', 'potency', 'bi', 'diagnosis', 'real', 'visualization', 'used', 'synthesis', 'reported', 'premise', 'precision', 'order', 'optimization', 'ongoing', 'meanwhile', 'maintain', 'inducted', 'incorporated', 'improve', 'improve', 'findings', 'expected', 'drugs', 'design', 'could', 'carried']"
"DDR (DNA damage response) defects in cells drive tumor formation by promoting DNA mutations, which also provides cancer-specific vulnerabilities that can be targeted by synthetic lethality-based therapies. Until now, PARP inhibitors like olaparib are the first successful case of utilizing synthetic lethality-based therapy to treat cancers with DNA-repairing deficiency (e.g. BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation), which has fueled the search for more targetable components in the DDR signaling pathway by exploiting synthetic lethality, including but not limited to DNA-PK, ATR, ATM, CHK1, and WEE1. After years of efforts, numerous DDR kinase inhibitors have been discovered. Some of them are being investigated in clinical trials and have shown promising results for cancer therapy. In this review, we summarize the latest advancement in the development of DDR kinase inhibitors including those in preclinical stages and clinical trials, the crystal structures of DDR enzymes, and binding modes of inhibitors with target proteins. The biological functions involving different genes and proteins (ATR, DNA-PK, ATM, PARP, CHK1, and WEE1) are also elucidated.","['biological functions involving different genes', 'cells drive tumor formation', 'numerous ddr kinase inhibitors', 'parp inhibitors like olaparib', 'ddr kinase inhibitors including', 'shown promising results', 'first successful case', 'brca2 mutation ),', 'ddr signaling pathway', 'utilizing synthetic lethality', 'exploiting synthetic lethality', 'also provides cancer', 'promoting dna mutations', 'dna damage response', 'synthetic lethality', 'ddr enzymes', 'cancer therapy', 'also elucidated', 'treat cancers', 'targetable components', 'specific vulnerabilities', 'repairing deficiency', 'preclinical stages', 'latest advancement', 'crystal structures', 'clinical trials', 'clinical trials', 'binding modes', 'based therapy', 'based therapies', 'target proteins', 'inhibitors', 'ddr', 'parp', 'including', 'dna', 'dna', 'dna', 'proteins', 'years', 'wee1', 'wee1', 'targeted', 'summarize', 'search', 'review', 'pk', 'pk', 'limited', 'investigated', 'g', 'fueled', 'efforts', 'e', 'discovered', 'development', 'defects', 'chk1', 'chk1', 'brca1', 'atr', 'atr', 'atm', 'atm']"
"C-mesenchymal-epithelia transition factor (c-Met) is highly expressed in various solid tumors such as gastric cancer, liver cancer, and lung cancer, playing a pivotal role in the growth, maintenance, and development of different tumor cells. In this study, three small-molecule fluorescent probes (5, 11, 16) targeting c-Met were developed, and their design strategies were also initially explored. In general, the fluorescence properties of the probes themselves could meet the imaging requirements, and they have shown sufficient inhibitory activities against c-Met, especially probe 16, reflecting the targeting and acceptance. Also, fluorescence polarization assays and flow cytometry analysis verified the binding between the probes and c-Met. Cell imaging confirmed that these probes could be used to label c-Met on living cells.

"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Cisplatin is a common chemotherapeutic, but its nephrotoxicity-driven AKI limits its clinical application. Currently, there are no specific and satisfactory therapies in the clinic for AKI. Inhibitors of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase 2 (HIF-PHD2) or histone deacetylase (HDACs) had shown renoprotective effects against AKI in preclinical studies. This study aimed to develop a novel therapeutic to prevent AKI progression by targeting PHD2 and HDACs simultaneously. We designed and synthesized a series of PHD2/HDACs hybrid inhibitors. The initial drug activity screening identified a candidate compound 31c, which exhibited potent inhibitory activities against PHD2 and HDAC1/2/6. Cellular analyses further showed that 31c did not affect cisplatin's antitumor activity in cancer cells but strongly protected cisplatin-induced toxicity on HK-2 cells. In vivo studies with the cisplatin-induced AKI mouse model demonstrated that 31c remarkably alleviated kidney dysfunction with suppressed plasma BUN/SCr and increased EPO levels. The potent renoprotective effects of 31c on AKI were confirmed by significant improvements in pathological kidney conditions in the mouse model. These results suggest that the novel PHD2/HDACs hybrid inhibitor, 31c, has a clinical potential as the renoprotective agent for the treatment/prevention of cisplatin-induced AKI for various cancers.","['initial drug activity screening identified', 'inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase 2', '31c remarkably alleviated kidney dysfunction', 'induced aki mouse model demonstrated', 'exhibited potent inhibitory activities', 'pathological kidney conditions', 'acute kidney injury', 'potent renoprotective effects', 'suppressed plasma bun', 'increased epo levels', 'shown renoprotective effects', 'hdacs hybrid inhibitor', 'candidate compound 31c', 'prevent aki progression', 'driven aki limits', 'strongly protected cisplatin', 'hdacs hybrid inhibitors', 'mouse model', 'antitumor activity', 'induced aki', 'induced toxicity', 'renoprotective agent', '2 cells', 'hdacs simultaneously', 'vivo studies', 'various cancers', 'study aimed', 'significant improvements', 'satisfactory therapies', 'results suggest', 'preclinical studies', 'novel therapeutic', 'histone deacetylase', 'high morbidity', 'common chemotherapeutic', 'clinical potential', 'clinical application', 'cellular analyses', 'cancer cells', 'affect cisplatin', 'targeting phd2', 'novel phd2', '2', 'hdacs', '31c', '31c', '31c', 'aki', 'aki', 'aki', 'aki', 'inhibitors', 'cisplatin', 'cisplatin', 'cisplatin', 'phd2', 'phd2', 'phd2', 'treatment', 'synthesized', 'specific', 'showed', 'series', 'scr', 'prevention', 'nephrotoxicity', 'mortality', 'hypoxia', 'hk', 'hif', 'hdac1', 'develop', 'designed', 'currently', 'confirmed', 'clinic', 'associated', '6']"

Additionally, compound 19k induced the apoptosis of Km-12 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Western blot analysis revealed that compound 19k inhibited the phosphorylation of TRK to block downstream pathways. Compound 19k also possessed outstanding plasma stability and liver microsomal stability in vitro, with half-lives greater than 289.1 min and 145 min, respectively.

"High temperature requirement A (HtrA) serine proteases have emerged as a novel class of antibacterial target, which are crucial in protein quality control and are involved in the pathogenesis of a wide array of bacterial infections. Previously, we demonstrated that HtrA in Chlamydia is essential for bacterial survival, replication and virulence. Here, we report a new series of proline (P2)-modified inhibitors of Chlamydia trachomatis HtrA (CtHtrA) developed by proline ring expansion and Cγ-substitutions. The structure-based drug optimization process was guided by molecular modelling and in vitro pharmacological evaluation of inhibitory potency, selectivity and cytotoxicity. Compound 25 from the first-generation 4-substituted proline analogues increased antiCtHtrA potency and selectivity over human neutrophil elastase (HNE) by approximately 6- and 12-fold, respectively, relative to the peptidic lead compound 1. Based on this compound, second-generation substituted proline residues containing 1,2,3-triazole moieties were synthesized by regioselective azide-alkyne click chemistry. Compound 49 demonstrated significantly improved antichlamydial activity in whole cell assays, diminishing the bacterial infectious progeny below the detection limit at the lowest dose tested. Compound 49 resulted in approximately 9- and 22-fold improvement in the inhibitory potency and selectivity relative to 1, respectively.

"The epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) is abnormally overexpressed on the cell surface of cancer cells and is strongly associated with cancer cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Tools enabling the visualization of EGFR in a structure-function approach are highly desirable to predict EGFR mutations and guide EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment making. Here, we describe the design, synthesis, and application of new, potent and selective clickable probes 13 (HX03), 20 (HX04) and 24 (HX05) by introducing an alkyne ligation handle to visualize EGFR activity in living cancer cells and tissue slices. These clickable probes are versatile chemical tools based on the key pharmacophore (4-anilinoquinazoline) of EGFR-TKIs (e.g., canertinib, dacomitinib and afatinib) and are able to irreversibly target the kinase domain of EGFR. Among them, 13 exhibits the highest reactivity towards EGFR kinase, particularly to EGFR kinase with primary mutations. Using activity-based protein profiling strategy, 13 showed high sensitivity and selectivity in labeling of endogenous EGFR in a native cellular context. Moreover, 13 was applied to visualize EGFR mutant activity in tumour tissues from non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) xenograft mouse models, and patients with NSCLC for the prediction of EGFR-TKI sensitivity.

"A type of pH-sensitive multi-targeted brain tumor site-specific liposomes (Lip-CTPP) co-modified with p-hydroxybenzoic acid (p-HA) and triphenylphosphonium (TPP) were designed and prepared to co-load doxorubicin (DOX) and lonidamine (LND). Lip-CTPP are promising potential carriers to exert the anti-glioma effect of DOX and LND collaboratively given the following features: 1) Lip-CTPP have a good pharmacokinetic behavior; 2) Lip-CTPP can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and recognize tumor cells through the affinity of p-HA and dopamine/sigma receptors; 3) Lip-CTPP are highly positive charged once the acid-sensitive amide bonds are cleaved in endo/lysosomes to expose TPP and protonate amine groups; 4) the positive charged Lip-CTPP escape from endo/lysosomes and accumulate in mitochondria through electrostatic adsorption; 5) DOX and LND are released and synergistically increase anti-tumor efficacy. Our in vitro and in vivo results confirmed that Lip-CTPP could greatly elevate the inhibition rate of tumor cell proliferation, migration and invasion, promote apoptosis and necrosis, and interfere with mitochondrial function. In addition, Lip-CTPP could significantly prolong the survival time of glioma bearing mice, narrow the tumor region and inhibit the infiltration and metastasis capability of glioma cells.

"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is considered as one of the most dangerous clinical pathogens. Biofilms forming ability of MRSA is also a major cause of drug resistance. Hence, it is in urgent need to develop novel antibacterial/antibiofilm drugs. Fascaplysin with a unique cationic five-ring coplanar backbone is emerging as a potential antibacterial compound. In this study, aiming at developing novel and more effective agents, a series of fascaplysin derivatives and their corresponding β-carboline precursors have been synthesized. Then their antibacterial/antibiofilm activity and mechanisms against MRSA were investigated for the first time. The results showed that most fascaplysins rather than β-carboline precursors exhibit superior antimicrobial activity against MRSA ATCC43300, demonstrating the important role of cationic five-ring coplanar backbone playing in antibacterial activity. Among them, 14 and 18 are the most potent compounds with MIC value of 0.098 μg/ml (10-fold lower than vancomycin), and 18 featuring the lowest toxicity. Subsequent mechanisms exploration indicates that 18 has relatively stronger ability to destroy bacterial cell wall and membrane, higher binding affinity to bacterial genomic DNA. Molecular docking study revealed that besides the key role of cationic five-ring coplanar backbone, introduction of N-aryl amide at 9-position of fascaplysin promoted the combination of compound 18 and DNA via additional π-π stacking and hydrogen bonding of the naphthyl group. Moreover, fascaplysins could inhibit MRSA biofilm formation in vitro and bacterial infection in vivo. All these results illustrate that fascaplysin derivative 18 is a strong and safe multi-target antibacterial agent, which makes it an attractive candidate for the treatment of MRSA and its biofilm infections.","['carboline precursors exhibit superior antimicrobial activity', 'fascaplysins could inhibit mrsa biofilm formation', 'destroy bacterial cell wall', 'subsequent mechanisms exploration indicates', 'molecular docking study revealed', 'dna via additional π', 'ring coplanar backbone playing', 'ring coplanar backbone', 'ring coplanar backbone', 'bacterial genomic dna', 'resistant staphylococcus aureus', 'relatively stronger ability', 'higher binding affinity', 'dangerous clinical pathogens', 'biofilms forming ability', 'target antibacterial agent', 'carboline precursors', 'potential antibacterial compound', 'develop novel antibacterial', 'unique cationic five', 'fascaplysin derivative 18', 'fascaplysins rather', 'biofilm infections', 'antibacterial activity', 'antibiofilm activity', 'π stacking', 'bacterial infection', 'cationic five', 'cationic five', 'developing novel', 'compound 18', 'vancomycin ),', 'urgent need', 'safe multi', 'results showed', 'results illustrate', 'potent compounds', 'naphthyl group', 'mrsa atcc43300', 'mic value', 'major cause', 'lowest toxicity', 'key role', 'important role', 'hydrogen bonding', 'fold lower', 'first time', 'fascaplysin promoted', 'fascaplysin derivatives', 'effective agents', 'drug resistance', 'attractive candidate', 'aryl amide', 'antibiofilm drugs', '098 μg', '18 featuring', 'corresponding β', 'study', 'mechanisms', 'antibacterial', 'mrsa', 'mrsa', 'mrsa', 'mrsa', 'fascaplysin', '18', '18', 'β', 'vivo', 'vitro', 'treatment', 'synthesized', 'strong', 'series', 'position', 'one', 'n', 'moreover', 'ml', 'methicillin', 'membrane', 'makes', 'investigated', 'introduction', 'hence', 'emerging', 'demonstrating', 'considered', 'combination', 'besides', 'among', 'also', 'aiming', '9', '14', '10', '0']"

Molecular docking studies on MAO-A, MAO-B, and aromatase enzymes were carried out for the aforementioned compounds. Additionally, molecular dynamics simulation was studied for compound 2q on MAO-B and aromatase complexes. Finally, the Field-based QSAR study was developed and the structure-activity relationship (SAR) was explained.

"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming the most predominant burden of chronic liver disease worldwide. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the progressive form of NAFLD, can develop into cirrhosis and hepatocellular cancer. Unfortunately, current options for therapeutic treatment of NASH are very limited. Among multiple pathways in NASH, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), a nuclear bile acid receptor, is well-recognized as an important effective target.

"PARP1 plays a crucial role in DNA damage repair, making it an essential target for cancer therapy. PARP1 inhibitors are widely used to treat BRCA-deficient malignancies, and six PARP inhibitors have been approved for clinical use. However, excluding the great clinical success of PARP inhibitors, the concomitant toxicity, drug resistance, and limited scope of application restrict their clinical efficacy. To find solutions to these problems, dual-target inhibitors have shown great potential. In recent years, several studies have linked PAPR1 to other primary cancer targets. Many dual-target inhibitors have been developed using structural fusion, linkage, or library construction methods, overcoming the defects of many single-target inhibitors of PARP1 and achieving great success in clinical cancer therapy.

"Squaraine dyes are a family of compounds known for their relevant photophysical and photochemical properties potentially useful as photosensitizing agents. Since pyridines have been introduced into the skeleton of several families of compounds to enhance their pharmacological activity, and this approach had not yet been performed on squaraines, novel dyes derived from benz[e]indole functionalized with picolyl- and dipicolylamine and N-ethyl and -hexyl chains were designed and synthesized. After being fully characterized, their interaction with human albumin was in vitro and in silico evaluated. Dyes were further assessed for their phototoxicity activity, and the most interesting ones were studied regarding cell localization and induction of morphological cell changes, genotoxicity, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. The molecules with N-ethyl chains showed the greatest in vitro light-dependent cytotoxic effects, particularly the zwitterionic squaraine dye and the one bearing a single pyridine unit, which also exhibited a more significant interaction with human albumin. Phenotypically, the cells incubated with these squaraines became smaller and rounded after irradiation, the effects varying with the tested concentration. Genotoxic effects were observed even without irradiation, being more evident for the N-ethyl picolylamine-derived dye. The fluorescence emitted by Rhodamine 123 largely coincided with that emitted by the dyes, suggesting that they are found preferentially in mitochondria.

"Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are targeted therapies, mainly used in oncology, consisting in a three-component molecular architecture combining a highly potent drug conjugated via a linker onto a monoclonal antibody (mAb), designed for the selective delivery of the drug to the tumor site. The linker is a key component, defining the ADC stability and mechanism of action, and particularly the drug release strategy. In this study, we have developed and synthesized a cleavable linker, which possesses an Asn-Pro-Val (NPV) sequence sensitive to the human neutrophil elastase (HNE), overexpressed in the tumor microenvironment. This linker permitted the site-specific conjugation of the cell-permeable drug, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), onto trastuzumab, using a disulfide re-bridging technology. The resulting ADC was then evaluated in vitro. This conjugate demonstrated retained antigen (Ag) binding affinity and exhibited high subnanomolar potency against Ag-positive tumor cells after internalization, suggesting an intracellular mechanism of linker cleavage. While no internalization and cytotoxic activity of this ADC was observed on Ag-negative cells in classical conditions, the supplementation of exogenous HNE permitted to restore a nanomolar activity on these cells, suggesting an extracellular mechanism of drug release in these conditions. This in vitro proof of concept tends to prove that the NPV sequence could allow a dual intra- and extracellular mechanism of drug release.

However, quercetin's low solubility and poor bioavailability have restricted its applicability; as a result, researchers have attempted to design and synthesize numerous novel quercetin derivatives using various methodologies in order to modify quercetin's constraints; the physico-chemical properties of quercetin's molecular scaffold make it appealing for drug development; low molecular mass and chemical groups are two of these characteristics. Therefore, the biological activities of quercetin derivatives, as well as the relationship between activity and chemical structure and their mechanism of action, were investigated.

"The human kinome plays a crucial role in several pathways. Its dysregulation has been linked to diverse central nervous system (CNS)-related disorders with a drastic impact on the aging population. Among them, tauopathies, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Frontotemporal Lobar degeneration (FTLD-tau), are neurodegenerative disorders pathologically defined by the presence of hyperphosphorylated tau-positive intracellular inclusions known as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs).

"Carbonic anhydrase IX is a promising target for the search for new antitumor compounds with improved properties. Using the molecular hybridization approach, on the basis of structures of a selective carbonic anhydrase IX inhibitor 3 and an activator of apoptosis 2 (1), a series of 1-substituted isatin-5-sulfonamides 5a-5u were designed and synthesized. The study of the inhibitory activity of isatin-5-sulfonamides showed the ability to inhibit I, II, IX, XII isoforms at nano- and micromolar concentrations. Docking of compounds 5e and 5k into the active site of II and IX carbonic anhydrase isoforms showed the coordination of sulfonamidate anions with zinc cations, as well as a number of additional hydrophobic interactions. The trifluoromethylthio derivative 5r suppressed the growth of tumor cells at low micromolar concentrations, maintaining activity on resistant lines and under hypoxic conditions. Immunoblotting of MCF7 cells treated with the 5r revealed its antiestrogenic activity and ability to activate apoptosis in tumor cells.","['selective carbonic anhydrase ix inhibitor 3', 'ix carbonic anhydrase isoforms showed', 'trifluoromethylthio derivative 5r suppressed', 'carbonic anhydrase ix', 'molecular hybridization approach', 'additional hydrophobic interactions', 'new antitumor compounds', 'mcf7 cells treated', 'low micromolar concentrations', 'xii isoforms', 'sulfonamides showed', 'micromolar concentrations', '5r revealed', 'compounds 5e', 'tumor cells', 'tumor cells', 'zinc cations', 'sulfonamides 5a', 'sulfonamidate anions', 'resistant lines', 'promising target', 'maintaining activity', 'inhibitory activity', 'improved properties', 'hypoxic conditions', 'apoptosis 2', 'antiestrogenic activity', 'active site', 'activate apoptosis', 'ix', 'substituted isatin', '1 ),', 'isatin', '1', 'well', 'using', 'synthesized', 'study', 'structures', 'series', 'search', 'number', 'nano', 'inhibit', 'immunoblotting', 'ii', 'ii', 'growth', 'docking', 'designed', 'coordination', 'basis', 'activator', 'ability', 'ability', '5u', '5k', '5', '5']"
"Aberrant activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling network is a key event in many human cancers and therefore enormous efforts have been made in the development of PI3K inhibitors. However, due to intrinsic and acquired resistance as well as poor drug tolerance, limited therapeutic efficacy has been achieved with these agents. In view of the fact that PI3K inhibitors can show synergistic antitumor effects with other cancer agents, namely mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitors, dual inhibition of both targets by a single-molecule is regarded as a promising complementary or alternative therapeutic strategy to overcome the drawbacks of just PI3K monotherapy.

"Inhibition of the RNA-binding protein LIN28 and disruption of the protein-RNA interaction of LIN28-let-7 with small molecules holds great potential to develop new anticancer therapeutics. Herein, we report the LIN28 inhibitory activities of a series of 30 small molecules with a tricyclic tetrahydroquinoline (THQ)-containing scaffold obtained from a Povarov reaction. The THQ molecules were structurally optimized by varying the 2-benzoic acid substituent, the fused ring at 3- and 4-positions, and the substituents at the phenyl moiety of the tetrahydroquinoline core. Among the tested compounds, GG-43 showed dose-dependent inhibition in an EMSA validation assay and low micromolar inhibitory activity in a fluorescence polarization-based assay measuring disruption of LIN28-let-7 interaction. Binding mode between GG-43 and the cold shock domain of LIN28 was proposed via a molecular docking analysis. The study provides one of the first systematic analyses on structural features that are required for LIN28 inhibition, and indicates the necessity to develop small molecules with new scaffolds as LIN28-targeting probes and therapeutic candidates.

"Off-target toxicity is one of the main challenges faced by anticancer chemotherapeutics. For tumor targeted and precision chemotherapy, we take the advantages of the ligand directed tumor active targeting of small molecule drug conjugates (SMDCs) and the passive tumor targeting of nanoparticles via the enhanced penetration and retention (EPR) effects, put forward a branched small molecule drug conjugate (BSMDC) nanomedicine design concept.

In cellular level, the BSMDC 1 NPs targeted asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR)-overexpressing HepG2 cells, were effectively taken up in the cells and released in tumor microenvironments, inhibited the HepG2 cell proliferation, arrested HepG2 cell in G2/M phase and induced tumor cell apoptosis. In HepG2 xenograft nude mice, the BSMDC 1 NPs were high specific to target the tumor and demonstrated a higher antitumor efficiency than BSMDC 1, having no apparent influences on mice body weights and major organs, supporting our BSMDC nanomedicine design concept.

"Achieving selective release of chemical anticancer agents and improving therapeutic efficacy has always been a hot spot in the field of cancer research, yet how to achieve this remains a great challenge.

Under the stimulation by cellular hypochlorous acid (HClO) and visible light, selective release of active naphthalimide can be achieved within breast cancer cell lines, the release process of which can be tracked visually using near-infrared fluorescence of MB (685 nm). More importantly, we developed biotinylated curcumin (Cur-Bio) as a new chemosensitizer, which significantly enhanced the ability of MCLOP to induce autophagic cell death of breast cancer cells.

"Vitamin D3 (VD3) is a seco-steroid that inhibits the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. Initial studies suggested its anti-Hh activity results from direct inhibition of Smoothened, a seven-transmembrane cell surface receptor that is a key regulator of the Hh signaling cascade. More recently, a role for the Vitamin D Receptor in mediating inhibition of Hh-signaling by seco-steroid has been suggested. Herein, an affinity-based protein profiling study was carried out to better understand the cellular proteins that govern VD3-mediated anti-Hh activity. We synthesized a novel biotinylated VD3 analogue (8) for use as a chemical probe to explore cellular binding targets of the seco-steroidal scaffold. Through a series of pull-down experiments and follow up mass spectrum analyses, heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) was identified as a primary binding protein of VD3. Hsp70 was validated as a binding target of VD3 through a series of biochemical and cellular assays. VD3 bound with micromolar affinity to Hsp70. In addition, both selective knockdown of Hsp70 expression and pharmacological inhibition of its activity with known Hsp70 inhibitors suppressed Hh-signaling transduction in murine basal cell carcinoma cells, suggesting that Hsp70 regulates proper Hh-signaling. Additional cellular assays suggest that VD3 and its seco-steroidal metabolites inhibit Hh-signaling through different mechanisms.","['murine basal cell carcinoma cells', 'known hsp70 inhibitors suppressed hh', 'heat shock protein 70', 'based protein profiling study', 'transmembrane cell surface receptor', 'explore cellular binding targets', 'additional cellular assays suggest', 'steroidal metabolites inhibit hh', 'novel biotinylated vd3 analogue', 'hsp70 regulates proper hh', 'primary binding protein', 'mass spectrum analyses', 'initial studies suggested', 'hh activity results', 'hh signaling cascade', 'cellular assays', 'steroidal scaffold', 'cellular proteins', 'binding target', 'hh activity', 'hsp70 expression', 'selective knockdown', 'pharmacological inhibition', 'mediating inhibition', 'key regulator', 'direct inhibition', 'different mechanisms', 'chemical probe', 'better understand', 'vd3 bound', 'govern vd3', 'signaling transduction', 'signaling pathway', 'vitamin d3', 'micromolar affinity', 'mediated anti', 'hh', 'hh', 'receptor', 'hsp70', 'hsp70', 'hsp70', 'suggested', 'activity', 'vd3', 'vd3', 'vd3', 'vd3', 'signaling', 'signaling', 'signaling', 'vitamin', 'anti', 'affinity', 'validated', 'use', 'synthesized', 'suggesting', 'steroid', 'steroid', 'smoothened', 'seven', 'series', 'series', 'seco', 'seco', 'seco', 'seco', 'role', 'recently', 'pull', 'inhibits', 'identified', 'herein', 'hedgehog', 'follow', 'experiments', 'carried', 'biochemical', 'addition', '8']"
"We recently discovered a new family of prodrugs deriving from phenyl 4-(2-oxo-3-imidazolidin-1-yl)benzenesulfonates (PIB-SOs) bioactivatable by cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) into potent antimitotics referred to as phenyl 4-(2-oxo-3-alkylimidazolidin-1-yl)benzenesulfonates (PAIB-SOs). PAIB-SOs display significant selectivity toward human breast cancer cells based on the N-dealkylation of PAIB-SOs into their corresponding PIB-SOs by CYP1A1. In this study, we have evaluated the molecular mechanism of the bioactivation of PAIB-SOs into PIB-SOs by branching the linear alkyl chain on the imidazolidin-2-one (IMZ) moiety of PAIB-SOs by branched alkyl groups such as isopropyl, isobutyl and sec-butyl. Our results show that PAIB-SOs bearing an isobutyl group on the IMZ moiety and either a methoxy, a chloro or a bromo group at positions 3, 3,5 or 3,4,5 on the aromatic ring B exhibit antiproliferative activity ranging from 0.13 to 6.9 μM and selectivity toward MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 mammary cancer cells comparatively to other cell lines tested. Moreover, the most potent and selective PAIB-SOs bearing an isobutyl group and either a 3,5-Cl (44), 3,5-Br (45) or a 3,4,5-OMe (46) on the IMZ moiety exhibit antiproliferative activity in the sub-micromolar range and high selectivity ratios toward mammary cancer cells. They stop the cell cycle of MCF7 cells in the G2/M phase and disrupt their cytoskeleton. Furthermore, our studies evidenced that PAIB-SOs bearing either an isopropyl, a sec-butyl or an isobutyl group are hydroxylated on the carbon atom adjacent to the IMZ (Cα-OH) but only PAIB-SOs bearing an isobutyl group are bioactivated into PIB-SOs. Finally, PAIB-SOs 45 and 46 exhibit low toxicity toward normal cells and chick embryos and are thus promising antimitotic prodrugs highly selective toward CYP1A1-expressing breast cancer cells.","['sos display significant selectivity toward human breast cancer cells based', 'thus promising antimitotic prodrugs highly selective toward cyp1a1', 'aromatic ring b exhibit antiproliferative activity ranging', 'high selectivity ratios toward mammary cancer cells', '46 exhibit low toxicity toward normal cells', '468 mammary cancer cells comparatively', 'expressing breast cancer cells', 'imz moiety exhibit antiproliferative activity', 'selectivity toward mcf7', 'phenyl 4 -( 2', 'phenyl 4 -( 2', 'linear alkyl chain', 'cytochrome p450 1a1', 'carbon atom adjacent', 'branched alkyl groups', 'cell lines tested', 'mcf7 cells', 'potent antimitotics referred', '44 ), 3', 'prodrugs deriving', 'selective paib', 'sos bearing either', 'imz moiety', 'cell cycle', 'sos bearing', 'sos bearing', 'sos bearing', 'sos ).', 'studies evidenced', 'results show', 'recently discovered', 'new family', 'molecular mechanism', 'micromolar range', 'chick embryos', 'bromo group', '9 μm', '46', 'isobutyl group', 'isobutyl group', 'isobutyl group', 'isobutyl group', 'sos 45', 'positions 3', 'cyp1a1', 'cyp1a1', 'corresponding pib', '2', 'moiety', '4', '4', 'imz', 'imz', 'sos', 'sos', 'sos', 'sos', 'sos', 'sos', 'sos', 'potent', 'isobutyl', 'either', 'either', '45', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', '3', 'pib', 'pib', 'pib', 'paib', 'paib', 'paib', 'paib', 'paib', 'paib', 'paib', 'paib', 'paib', 'yl', 'yl', 'sub', 'study', 'stop', 'sec', 'sec', 'phase', 'oxo', 'oxo', 'one', 'ome', 'oh', 'n', 'moreover', 'methoxy', 'mda', 'mb', 'isopropyl', 'isopropyl', 'imidazolidin', 'imidazolidin', 'hydroxylated', 'g2', 'furthermore', 'finally', 'evaluated', 'disrupt', 'dealkylation', 'cα', 'cytoskeleton', 'cl', 'chloro', 'butyl', 'butyl', 'branching', 'br', 'bioactivation', 'bioactivated', 'bioactivatable', 'benzenesulfonates', 'benzenesulfonates', 'alkylimidazolidin', '6', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '13', '1', '1', '0']"

Despite the remarkable potency and efficacy of ibrutinib against various lymphomas and leukemias in the clinics, there are also some clinical limitations, such as off-target toxicities and primary/acquired drug resistance. As strategies to overcome these challenges, second- and third-generation BTK inhibitors, BTK-PROTACs, as well as combination therapies have been explored.

"The drug resistance and low specificity of current available chemotherapeutics to cancer cells are the main reasons responsible for the failure of cancer chemotherapy and remain dramatic challenges for cancer therapy, creating an urgent need to develop novel anticancer agents. Carbazole nucleus, widely distributed in nature, is a predominant feature of a vast array of biologically active compounds. Carbazole derivatives exhibited potential antiproliferative activity against different cancer cell lines by diverse mechanisms, inclusive of arrest cell cycle and induce apoptosis, and several anticancer agents are carbazole-based compounds. Thus, carbazole derivatives represent a fertile source for discovery of novel anticancer therapeutic agents. Over the past several years, a variety of carbazole hybrids have been developed as potential anticancer agents.

"Insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) is a zinc metalloprotease that cleaves numerous substrates among which amyloid-β and insulin. It has been linked through genetic studies to the risk of type-2 diabetes (T2D) or Alzheimer's disease (AD). Pharmacological activation of IDE is an attractive therapeutic strategy in AD. While IDE inhibition gave paradoxal activity in glucose homeostasis, recent studies, in particular in the liver suggest that IDE activators could be also of interest in diabetes. Here we describe the discovery of an original series of IDE activators by screening and structure-activity relationships. Early cellular studies show that hit 1 decreases glucose-stimulating insulin secretion. Docking studies revealed it has an unprecedented extended binding to the polyanion-binding site of IDE.

"Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) promotes tumor progression by intracellular signal transduction and regulation of gene expression and protein turnover, which is a compelling therapeutic target for various cancer types, including ovarian cancer. However, the clinical responses of FAK inhibitors remain unsatisfactory. Here, we describe the discovery of FAK inhibitors using a scaffold hopping strategy. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) exploration identified 36 as a potent FAK inhibitor, which exhibited inhibitory activities against FAK signaling in vitro. Treatment with 36 not only decreased migration and invasion of PA-1 cells, but also reduced expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9.

"Biased agonism refers to the ability of compounds to drive preferred signaling pathways and avoid adverse signaling pathways in a ligand-dependent manner for some G-protein-coupled receptors. It is thought that the separation of therapeutic efficacy (e.g., analgesia) from adverse effects (e.g., respiration depression) can be achieved through the design of biased MOR agonists and one example is the recently approved MOR biased agonist oliceridine (TRV130). However, oliceridine only demonstrates modest beneficial effects as compared to other opioids in terms of therapeutic/adverse effect balance. One possibility attributable to the modest success of oliceridine is its limited bias, and as such developing MOR ligands with a more biased agonism profile could in theory further improve the beneficial effects of the ligands. Here, we rationally designed and synthesized a series of derivatives as potent highly biased MOR agonists (19a-v) through the modification and structure-activity relationship study of TRV130.

"Established roles for PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways in tumorigenesis has prompted extensive research towards the discovery of small-molecule inhibitors as cancer therapeutics. However, significant compensatory regulation exists between these two signaling cascades, leading to redundancy among survival pathways. Consequently, initial clinical trials aimed at either PI3K or MEK inhibition alone have proven ineffective and highlight the need for development of targeted and innovative therapeutic combination strategies. We designed a series of PI3K inhibitor derivatives wherein a single morpholine group of the PI3K inhibitor ZSTK474 was substituted with a variety of 2-aminoethyl functional groups. Analogs with pendant hydroxyl or methoxy groups maintained low nanomolar inhibition towards PI3Kα, PI3Kγ, and PI3Kδ isoforms in contrast to those with pendant amino groups which were significantly less inhibitory. Synthesis of prototype PI3K/MEK bifunctional inhibitors (6r, 6s) was guided by the structure-activity data, where a MEK-targeting inhibitor was tethered directly via a short PEG linker to the triazine core of the PI3K inhibitor analogs.

"Nanomedicine is an emerging area that largely influences the efficacy of various therapies through the rational design of new materials exhibiting more targeted behavior.

Even though materials science offers diverse options for different types of therapies, it is a difficult task to meet all the parameters mentioned above.

As will be presented, the most common dendrons used for biomedical applications are polyamide, polyester, carbosilane, polyether, and glycol-type, which are bonded to biological active molecules (BAMs), or molecular nanoplatforms (MPs) by hydrolysable bonds. Also relevant is the fact that the incorporation of dendrons not larger than third generation (G3) is sufficient to improve essential properties of these molecular systems, such as aqueous solubility, stability, and cellular internalization, among others.

"Epigentic enzymes histone deacetylases (HDACs) catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from the ε-N-acetylated lysine residues of various protein substrates including both histone and non-histone proteins. Different HDACs have distinct biological functions and are recruited to specific regions of the genome. Due to their important biological functions, HDACs have been validated in clinics for anticancer therapy, and are being explored for potential treatment of several other diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD), metabolic disease, viral infection, and multiple sclerosis, etc. Besides five approved drugs, there are more than thirty HDACs inhibitors currently being investigated in clinical trials. Centering on the advances of drug discovery programs in this field since 2020, this review discusses HDACs inhibitors from the aspects of the structure-based rational design, isoform selectivity, pharmacology, and toxicology of the compounds of interest.

"Gastric cancer represents a significant health burden worldwide. Previously, inspired by the traditional Chinese medicine Wu-Chu-Yu to treat the spleen and stomach system for thousands of years, we identified N14-phenyl substituted evodiamine derivatives as potential antitumor agents with favorable inhibition on Top1. Herein, structural optimization and structure-activity relationship studies (SARs) led us to discovering a highly active evodiamine derivative compound 6t against gastric cancer. Further anti-tumor mechanism studies revealed that compound 6t played as the inhibition of topoisomerase 1 (Top1), effectively induced apoptosis, obviously arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M phase, and significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of SGC-7901 and MGC-803 cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the compound 6t was low toxicity in vivo and exhibited excellent anti-tumor activity (TGI = 70.12%) in the MGC-803 xenograft models.

"Hybrid molecules targeting simultaneously DNA polymerase α (POLA1) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) were designed and synthesized to exploit a potential synergy of action. Among a library of screened molecules, MIR002 and GEM144 showed antiproliferative activity at nanomolar concentrations on a panel of human solid and haematological cancer cell lines. In vitro functional assays confirmed that these molecules inhibited POLA1 primer extension activity, as well as HDAC11. Molecular docking studies also supported these findings. Mechanistically, MIR002 and GEM144 induced acetylation of p53, activation of p21, G1/S cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis.

"Human α1-antitrypsin (hAAT) has two distinguishing functions: anti-protease activity and regulation of the immune system. In the present study we hypothesized that those two protein functions are mediated by different structural domains on the hAAT surface. Indeed, such biologically active immunoregulatory sites (not associated with canonical anti-protease activity) on the surface of hAAT were identified by in silico methods. Several peptides were derived from those immunoregulatory sites. Four peptides exhibited impressive biological effects in pharmacological concentration ranges. Peptidomimetic (14) was developed, based on the structure of the most druggable and active peptide. The compound exhibited a potent anti-inflammatory activity in vitro and in vivo.

"In the past few years, researchers have shed light on the immense importance of ubiquitin in numerous regulatory pathways. The post-translational addition of mono or poly-ubiquitin molecules namely ""ubiquitinoylation"" is therefore pivotal to maintain the cell's vitality, maturation, differentiation, and division. Part of conserving homeostasis stems from maintaining the ubiquitin pool in the vicinity of the cell's intracellular environment; this crucial role is played by deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) that cleave ubiquitin molecules from target molecules. To date, they are categorized into 7 families with ubiquitin carboxyl c-terminal de-hydrolase family (UCH) as the most common and well-studied. Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L (UCH-L3) is a significant protein in this family as it has been implicated in many molecular and cellular processes with its mRNA identified in a range of body tissues including the brain. It goes without saying that it manifests in maintaining health and when abnormally regulated in disease. As it is an attractive small molecule drug target, scientists have used high throughput screening (HTS) and other drug discovery methods to discover inhibitors for this enzyme for the treatment of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.

"The EGFR family play a significant role in cell signal transduction and their overexpression is implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous human solid cancers. Inhibition of the EGFR-mediated signaling pathways by EGFR inhibitors is a widely used strategy for the treatment of cancers. In most cases, the EGFR inhibitors used in clinic were only effective when the cancer cells harbored specific activating EGFR mutations which appeared to preserve the ligand-dependency of receptor activation but altered the pattern of downstream signaling pathways. Moreover, cancer is a kind of multifactorial disease, and therefore manipulating a single target may result in treatment failure. Although drug combinations for the treatment of cancers proved to be successful, the use of two or more drugs concurrently still was a challenge in clinical therapy owing to various dose-limiting toxicities and drug-drug interactions caused by pharmacokinetic profiles changed. Therefore, a single drug targeting two or multiple targets could serve as an effective strategy for the treatment of cancers. In recent, drugs with diverse pharmacological effects have been shown to be more advantageous than combination therapies due to their lower incidences of side effects and more resilient therapies. Accordingly, dual target-single-agent strategy has become a popular field for cancer treatment, and researchers became more and more interest in the development of novel dual-target drugs in recent years. In this review, we briefly introduce the EGFR family proteins and synergisms between EGFR and other anticancer targets, and summarizes the development of potential dual target inhibitors based on wild-type and/or mutant EGFR for the treatment of solid cancers in the past five years.

"DYRK1A phosphorylates proteins involved in neurological disorders in an intermolecular manner. Meanwhile, during the protein folding process of DYRK1A, a transitional folding intermediate catalyzes the intramolecular autophosphorylation required for the ""one-off"" inceptive activation and stabilization. In our previous study, a small molecule termed FINDY (1) was identified, which inhibits the folding intermediate-catalyzed intramolecular autophosphorylation of DYRK1A but not the folded state-catalyzed intermolecular phosphorylation. However, the structural features of FINDY (1) responsible for this intermediate-selective inhibition remain elusive. In this study, structural derivatives of FINDY (1) were designed and synthesized according to its predicted binding mode in the ATP pocket of DYRK1A. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) of the derivatives revealed that the selectivity against the folding intermediate is determined by steric hindrance between the bulky hydrophobic moiety of the derivatives and the entrance to the pocket. In addition, a potent derivative 3 was identified, which inhibited the folding intermediate more strongly than FINDY (1); it was designated as dp-FINDY. Although dp-FINDY (3) did not inhibit the folded state, as well as FINDY (1), it inhibited the intramolecular autophosphorylation of DYRK1A in an in vitro cell-free protein synthesis assay. Furthermore, dp-FINDY (3) destabilized endogenous DYRK1A in HEK293 cells. This study provides structural insights into the folding intermediate-selective inhibition of DYRK1A and expands the chemical options for the design of a kinase inhibitor.","['free protein synthesis assay', 'selective inhibition remain elusive', 'dyrk1a phosphorylates proteins involved', 'small molecule termed findy', 'study provides structural insights', 'transitional folding intermediate catalyzes', 'protein folding process', 'predicted binding mode', 'bulky hydrophobic moiety', 'catalyzed intermolecular phosphorylation', 'intramolecular autophosphorylation required', 'catalyzed intramolecular autophosphorylation', 'destabilized endogenous dyrk1a', 'potent derivative 3', 'selective inhibition', 'intramolecular autophosphorylation', 'structural features', 'folding intermediate', 'folding intermediate', 'folding intermediate', 'folding intermediate', 'intermolecular manner', 'previous study', 'structural derivatives', 'vitro cell', 'synthesized according', 'steric hindrance', 'quantitative structure', 'neurological disorders', 'kinase inhibitor', 'inceptive activation', 'hek293 cells', 'folded state', 'folded state', 'chemical options', 'activity relationship', 'derivatives revealed', 'atp pocket', '1 );', '1 ),', 'although dp', 'study', 'intermediate', 'dyrk1a', 'dyrk1a', 'dyrk1a', 'dyrk1a', 'dyrk1a', 'derivatives', '3', '3', 'pocket', '1', '1', '1', 'findy', 'findy', 'findy', 'findy', 'findy', 'findy', 'findy', 'dp', 'dp', 'well', 'strongly', 'stabilization', 'selectivity', 'responsible', 'qsar', 'one', 'meanwhile', 'inhibits', 'inhibited', 'inhibited', 'inhibit', 'identified', 'identified', 'however', 'furthermore', 'expands', 'entrance', 'determined', 'designed', 'designated', 'design', 'addition']"
"Quinazolines are considered as a promising class of bioactive heterocyclic compounds with broad properties. Particularly, the quinazoline scaffold has an impressive role in the design and synthesis of new CNS-active drugs. The drug-like properties and pharmacological characteristics of quinazoline could lead to different drugs with various targets. Among CNS disorders, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with memory loss, cognitive decline and language dysfunction. AD is a complex and multifactorial disease therefore, the need for finding multi-target drugs against this devastative disease is urgent. A literature survey revealed that quinazoline derivatives have diverse therapeutic potential for AD as modulators/inhibitors of β-amyloid, tau protein, cholinesterases, monoamine oxidases, and phosphodiesterases as well as other protective effects. Thus, we describe here the most relevant and recent studies about anti-AD agents with quinazoline structure which can further aid the development and discovery of new anti-AD agents.","['progressive neurodegenerative disorder', 'literature survey revealed', 'diverse therapeutic potential', 'bioactive heterocyclic compounds', 'among cns disorders', 'quinazoline could lead', 'multifactorial disease therefore', 'new cns', 'quinazoline structure', 'quinazoline scaffold', 'quinazoline derivatives', 'various targets', 'tau protein', 'target drugs', 'recent studies', 'protective effects', 'promising class', 'pharmacological characteristics', 'monoamine oxidases', 'memory loss', 'like properties', 'language dysfunction', 'impressive role', 'finding multi', 'different drugs', 'devastative disease', 'cognitive decline', 'broad properties', 'active drugs', 'new anti', 'ad agents', 'ad agents', 'disease', 'anti', 'ad', 'ad', 'ad', 'β', 'well', 'urgent', 'thus', 'synthesis', 'relevant', 'quinazolines', 'phosphodiesterases', 'particularly', 'need', 'modulators', 'inhibitors', 'drug', 'discovery', 'development', 'design', 'describe', 'considered', 'complex', 'cholinesterases', 'amyloid', 'alzheimer', 'aid']"
"In recent decades, pharmacological targeting of the autotaxin (ATX)/lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) axis accounted for excellent disease management benefits. Herein, to extend the scope of structure-activity relationships (SARs), fifteen indole-based carbamate derivatives (1-15) were prepared to evaluate the ATX inhibitory potency. Among them, compound 4 bearing morpholine moiety was identified as the optimal ATX inhibitor (0.41 nM), superior to the positive control GLPG1690 (2.90 nM). To resolve the intractable issue of poor pharmacokinetic (PK) property, urea moiety was introduced as a surrogate of carbamate which furnished compounds 16-30. The dedicated modification identified the diethanolamine entity 30 with satisfactory water solubility and PK profiles with a minimum sacrifice of ATX inhibition (2.17 nM). The most promising candidate 30 was evaluated for anti-fibrosis effect in a bleomycin challenged mice lung fibrosis model. Upon treatment with 30, the in vivo ATX activity in both lung homogenate and broncheoalveolar fluid (BALF) sample was significantly down-regulated. Furthermore, the gene expression of pro-fibrotic cytokines transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), interleukin- 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in lung tissue was reduced to normal level.

"Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is a serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in cell cycle regulation and mitotic progression. Studies have shown that PLK1 is upregulated in many tumors and high levels are adversely related to a poor prognosis. Knocking down or inhibiting PLK1 results in synthetic lethality in PTEN deficient prostate tumors and Kras mutant colorectal tumors, further validating PLK1 as an oncotarget. Substrate recognition by PLK1 occurs through the Polo-Box Domain (PBD), which is a phospho-peptide binding site also responsible for subcellular localization. Much effort has been directed to target this kinase therapeutically through the ATP-binding site, and a few such inhibitors have advanced to clinical trials however with limited clinical efficacy. Moreover, it has been shown that a point mutation in PLK1 (C67V) confers dramatic cellular resistance to catalytic site inhibitors. An alternative approach to target PLK1 potently and selectively is through the PBD to block its protein-protein interactions. Through the REPLACE strategy, for converting peptide inhibitors into more drug-like non peptidic compounds, a PBD targeting compound series (""ABBAs""), has been identified and the key determinants of potency and selectivity elucidated through structure-activity relationship studies. In cellular experiments, the ABBAs were shown to lead to profound effects on the cell cycle, to inhibit tumor proliferation and overcome resistance of cells expressing the PLK1 C67V mutant to ATP-based inhibitors.

"Indoloquinoline (IQ) is an important class of naturally occurring antimalarial alkaloids, mainly represented by cryptolepine, isocryptolepine, and neocryptolepine. The IQ structural framework consists of four isomeric ring systems differing via the linkage of indole with quinoline as [3,2-b], [3,2-c], [2,3-c], and [2,3-b]. Structurally, IQs are planar and thus they bind strongly to the DNA which largely contributes to their biological properties. The structural rigidity and associated nonspecific cellular toxicity is a key shortcoming of the IQ structural framework for preclinical development. Thus, the lead optimization efforts were aimed at improving the therapeutic window and ADME properties of IQs. The structural modifications mainly involved attaching the basic aminoalkyl chains that positively modulates the vital physicochemical and topological parameters, thereby improves biological activity. Our analysis has found that the aminoalkylation consistently improved the selectivity index and provided acceptable in-vivo antimalarial/anticancer activity.

Based on TCA1, LZDT1 was designed to optimize the hydrophobic interaction with Leu317. A subsequent biochemical and cellular assay displayed increased potency of LZDT1 in inhibiting DprE1 and killing drug-sensitive/-resistant Mycobacterium strains. The improved activity of LZDT1 and its analogue LZDT2 against multidrug resistant tuberculosis was particularly highlighted. For LZDT1, its enhanced interaction with Leu317 also impaired the drug-insensitivity of DprE1 caused by Cys387 mutation. A new nonbenzothiazole lead (LZDT10) with reduced Cys387-dependence was further produced by optimizing interactions with Leu317, improvement directions for LZDT10 were discussed as well.

"Vaccine refers to biological products that are produced using various pathogenic microorganisms for inoculation. The goal of vaccination is to induce a robust immune response against a specific antigen, thus preventing the organism from getting infected. In vaccines, adjuvants have been widely employed to enhance immunity against specific antigens. An ideal adjuvant should be stable, biodegradable, and low cost, not induce system rejection and promote an immune response. Various adjuvant components have been investigated across diverse applications. Typically, adjuvants are employed to meet the following objectives: (1) to improve the effectiveness of immunization with vaccines for specific populations, such as newborns and the elderly; (2) enhance the immunogenicity of highly purified or recombinant antigens; (3) allow immunization with a smaller dose of the vaccine, reducing drug dosage.

We show that compound 2 composed of an indirubin-3'-oxime group linked with a (N-methylpiperidin-2-yl)ethyl moiety possessed inhibitory activity toward both TLK1 and TLK2 in vitro and diminished the phosphorylation level of the downstream substrate anti-silencing function 1 (ASF1) in replicating cells. The treatment of compound 2 impaired DNA replication, slowed S-phase progression, and triggered DNA damage response in replicating cells. Structure optimization further discovered six derivatives exhibiting potent TLK inhibitory activity and revealed the importance of the tertiary amine-containing moiety of the side chain. Moreover, the derivatives 6, 17, 19, and 20 strongly suppressed the growth of triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells, non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells, and colorectal cancer HCT-116 cells, while normal lung fibroblast MRC5 and IMR90 cells showed a lower response to these compounds.

"Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which hijack proteins of interest (POIs) and recruit E3 ligases for target degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, are a novel drug discovery paradigm that has been widely used as biological tools and medicinal molecules with the potential of clinical application value. To date, a wide variety of small molecule PROTACs have been developed. Importantly, VHL-based PROTACs have emerged to be a promising approach for proteins, including those non-druggable ones, such as transcriptional factors and scaffold proteins. VHL-based PRTOACs have been developed for the treatment of diseases that are difficult to be dealt with by conventional methods, such as radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and small molecule inhibitors.

"The equilibrium between histone acetylation and deacetylation plays an important role in cancer initiation and progression. The histone deacetylases (HDACs) are a class of key regulators of gene expression that enzymatically remove an acetyl moiety from acetylated lysine ε-amino groups on histone tails. Therefore, HDAC inhibitors have recently emerged as a promising strategy for cancer therapy and several pan-HDAC inhibitors have globally been approved for clinical use. In the present study, we designed and synthesized a series of substituted indole-based hydroxamic acid derivatives that exhibited potent anti-proliferative activities in various tumor cell lines.

"Human African trypanosomiasis is a vector-borne tropical disease of African origin. Presently, due to human migration and climate change, the disease might present global health and economic burdens as current chemotherapy of trypanosomiasis remains a challenge due to limited existing drugs, which are of poor efficacy, cause severe adverse events and are very costly. Recently, Beteck and co-workers identified a small library of 1,3,6-substituted non-fluoroquinolones that showed moderate to weak trypanocidal activity without cytotoxic effects. The current study further explored SARs of the quinolone scaffold in search for more potent trypanocidal agents.

"TumorSelect® is an anticancer technology that combines cytotoxics, nanotechnology, and knowledge of human physiology to develop innovative therapeutic interventions with minimal undesirable side effects commonly observed in conventional chemotherapy. Tumors have a voracious appetite for cholesterol which facilitates tumor growth and fuels their proliferation. We have transformed this need into a stealth delivery system to disguise and deliver anticancer drugs with the assistance of both the human body and the tumor cell. Several designer prodrugs are incorporated within pseudo-LDL nanoparticles, which carry them to tumor tissues, are taken up, internalized, transformed into active drugs, and inhibit cancer cell proliferation. Highly lipophilic prodrug conjugates of paclitaxel suitable for incorporation into the pseudo-LDL nanoparticles of the TumorSelect® delivery vehicle formulation were designed, synthesized, and evaluated in the panel of 24-h NCI-60 human tumor cell line screening to demonstrate the power of such an innovative approach. Taxane prodrugs, viz., ART-207 was synthesized by tethering paclitaxel to lipid moiety with the aid of a racemic solketal as a linker in cost-effective, simple, and straightforward synthetic transformations. In addition to the typical 24-h NCI screening protocol, these compounds were assessed for growth inhibition or killing of ovarian cell lines for 48 and 72h-time intervals and identified the long-lasting effectiveness of these lipophilic prodrugs. All possible, enantiomerically pure isomers of ART-207 were also synthesized, and cytotoxicities were biosimilar to racemic ART-207, suggesting that enantiopurity of linker has a negligible effect on cell proliferation. To substantiate further, ART-207 was evaluated for its in vivo tumor reduction efficacy by studying the xenograft model of ovarian cancer grown in SCID mice. Reduced weight loss (a measure of toxicity) in the ART-207 group was observed, even though it was dosed at 2.5x the paclitaxel equivalent of Abraxane®. As a result, our delineated approach is anticipated to improve patient quality of life, patient retention in treatment regimes, post-treatment rapid recovery, and overall patient compliance without compromising the efficacy of the cytotoxic promiscuous natural products.","['minimal undesirable side effects commonly observed', '60 human tumor cell line screening', 'overall patient compliance without compromising', 'tumorselect ® delivery vehicle formulation', 'cytotoxic promiscuous natural products', 'highly lipophilic prodrug conjugates', 'h nci screening protocol', 'develop innovative therapeutic interventions', 'vivo tumor reduction efficacy', 'inhibit cancer cell proliferation', 'stealth delivery system', 'ovarian cancer grown', 'ovarian cell lines', 'improve patient quality', 'straightforward synthetic transformations', 'reduced weight loss', 'enantiomerically pure isomers', 'facilitates tumor growth', 'treatment rapid recovery', 'several designer prodrugs', 'incorporated within pseudo', 'deliver anticancer drugs', 'viz ., art', 'tumorselect ®', 'tumor cell', 'h nci', 'cell proliferation', 'tumor tissues', 'patient retention', 'lipophilic prodrugs', 'human physiology', 'human body', 'innovative approach', 'treatment regimes', 'growth inhibition', 'anticancer technology', 'active drugs', 'taxane prodrugs', 'xenograft model', 'voracious appetite', 'time intervals', 'tethering paclitaxel', 'scid mice', 'racemic solketal', 'paclitaxel suitable', 'paclitaxel equivalent', 'negligible effect', 'lipid moiety', 'ldl nanoparticles', 'ldl nanoparticles', 'lasting effectiveness', 'even though', 'delineated approach', 'conventional chemotherapy', 'combines cytotoxics', 'abraxane ®.', 'racemic art', 'typical 24', 'observed', 'also synthesized', '207 group', 'efficacy', 'proliferation', 'pseudo', 'art', 'art', 'art', '24', 'synthesized', 'synthesized', '207', '207', '207', '207', 'tumors', 'transformed', 'transformed', 'toxicity', 'taken', 'suggesting', 'substantiate', 'studying', 'simple', 'result', 'power', 'post', 'possible', 'panel', 'need', 'nanotechnology', 'measure', 'long', 'linker', 'linker', 'life', 'knowledge', 'killing', 'internalized', 'incorporation', 'identified', 'fuels', 'evaluated', 'evaluated', 'enantiopurity', 'effective', 'dosed', 'disguise', 'designed', 'demonstrate', 'cytotoxicities', 'cost', 'compounds', 'cholesterol', 'carry', 'biosimilar', 'assistance', 'assessed', 'anticipated', 'aid', 'addition', '72h', '5x', '48', '2']"

However, both diseases still affect millions of people every year, pointing to the necessity of new therapies. Quinolines have a long-standing history as antimalarial agents, but established quinoline-containing antimalarial drugs are now facing widespread resistance of the Plasmodium parasite. Nevertheless, as evidenced by a massive number of recent literature contributions, they are still of great value for future developments in this field. On the other hand, the number of currently approved anticancer drugs containing a quinoline scaffold are limited, but a strong increase and interest in quinoline compounds as potential anticancer agents can be seen in the last few years.

"Microtubule target agents (MTAs) are widely-used clinical anti-cancer drugs for decades, but the acquired drug resistance severely restricted their application. Thioredoxin reductases (TrxR) was reported to be overexpressed in most tumors and closely related to high risk of cancer recurrence and drug resistance, making it a potential target for anticancer drug discovery. Multi-target-directed ligands (MTDLs) by a single molecule provide a logical and alternative approach to drug combinations. In this work, based on the structure-activity relationships obtained in our previous study, some structure modifications were performed. On one hand, the retained skeleton structure of MTAs endowed its tubulin polymerization inhibition activity, on the other hand, the selenium-containing structure and α,β-unsaturated ketone moiety endowed the TrxR inhibition activity. As results, the newly obtained compounds exhibited superior anti-proliferative activities towards various human cancer cells and drug-resistance cells, and displayed high selectivity towards various human normal cells. The mechanism study revealed that the dual effect of cell cycle arrest triggered by targeting tubulin and the abnormal accumulation of ROS caused by TrxR inhibition eventually lead to cell apoptosis.

"The ubiquitination of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is mediated by interacting with the von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL), and is associated with cancer, chronic anemia, and ischemia. VHL, an E3 ligase, has been reported to degrade HIF-1 for decades, however, there are few successful inhibitors currently. Poor understanding of the binding pocket and a lack of in-depth exploration of the interactions between two proteins are the main reasons. Hence, we developed an effective strategy to identify and design new inhibitors for protein-protein interaction targets. The hydroxyproline (Hyp564) of HIF-1α contributed the key interaction between HIF-1α and VHL. In this study, detailed information of the binding pocket were explored by alanine scanning, site-directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations. Interestingly, we found the interaction(s) between Y565 and H110 played a key role in the binding of VHL/HIF-1α. Based on the interactions, 8 derivates of VH032, 16a-h, were synthesized by introducing various groups bounded to H110. Further assay on protein and cellular level exhibited that 16a-h accessed higher binding affinity to VHL and markable or modest improvement in stabilization of HIF-1α or HIF-1α-OH in HeLa cells.

"The first structural analysis comparing the binding mode to the target carbonic anhydrases (CAs, EC 4.2.1.1) of two opposite classes of modulators is presented here: coumarin derivatives act as prodrug CA inhibitors (CAIs), being hydrolyzed by the enzyme esterase activity to 2-hydroxycinnamic acids that occlude the active site entrance; CA activators (CAAs) belonging of the amine and amino acid types, enhance the CA activity by increasing the efficiency of the rate-determining proton shuttling step in the CA catalytic cycle. Analysis of the crystallographic data available for the human CA isoform II in adduct with two coumarin CAIs and some CAAs showed that both types of CA modulators bind in the same region of the enzyme active site, basically interacting with superimposable amino acid residues, that are Trp5, Asn62, His64, Asn67, Gln92, Thr200. A plethora of water molecules also participate in the adducts formation. This structural analysis showed that presence of certain chemical groups in the compound structure is mandatory to produce an activating rather than inhibitory action, such as multiple nitrogen- and oxygen-based moieties capable of shuttling protons or forming extended H-bond networks nearby the proton shuttle residue.

"Several generations of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are available in the market for the treatment of seizures, but these are amalgamated with acute to chronic side effects. The most common side effects of AEDs are dose-related, but some are idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions (ADRs) that transpire due to the formation of reactive metabolite (RM) after the bioactivation process. Because of the adverse reactions patients usually discontinue the medication in between the treatment. The AEDs such as valproic acid, lamotrigine, phenytoin etc., can be categorized under such types because they form the RM which may prevail with life-threatening adverse effects or immune-mediated reactions. Hepatotoxicity, teratogenicity, cutaneous hypersensitivity, dizziness, addiction, serum sickness reaction, renal calculi, metabolic acidosis are associated with the metabolites of drugs such as arene oxide, N-desmethyldiazepam, 2-(1-hydroxyethyl)-2-methylsuccinimide, 2-(sulphamoy1acetyl)-phenol, E-2-en-VPA and 4-en-VPA and carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, etc. The major toxicities are associated with the moieties that are either capable of forming RM or the functional groups may itself be too reactive prior to the metabolism. These functional groups or fragment structures are typically known as structural alerts or toxicophores. Therefore, minimizing the bioactivation potential of lead structures in the early phases of drug discovery by a modification to low-risk drug molecules is a priority for the pharmaceutical companies. Additionally, excellent potency and pharmacokinetic (PK) behaviour help in ensuring that appropriate (low dose) candidate drugs progress into the development phase. The current review discusses about RMs in the anticonvulsant drugs along with their mechanism vis-a-vis research efforts that have been taken to minimize the toxic effects of AEDs therapy.","['adverse reactions patients usually discontinue', '2 -( sulphamoy1acetyl )- phenol', 'idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions', 'hydroxyethyl )- 2', '2 -( 1', 'threatening adverse effects', 'serum sickness reaction', 'risk drug molecules', 'current review discusses', 'common side effects', 'chronic side effects', 'vis research efforts', 'candidate drugs progress', 'anticonvulsant drugs along', 'phenytoin etc .,', 'functional groups may', 'mediated reactions', 'functional groups', 'drug discovery', 'toxic effects', 'mechanism vis', 'may prevail', 'antiepileptic drugs', 'valproic acid', 'typically known', 'transpire due', 'structural alerts', 'several generations', 'renal calculi', 'reactive prior', 'reactive metabolite', 'pharmaceutical companies', 'metabolic acidosis', 'major toxicities', 'lead structures', 'fragment structures', 'excellent potency', 'either capable', 'early phases', 'development phase', 'cutaneous hypersensitivity', 'bioactivation process', 'bioactivation potential', 'behaviour help', 'arene oxide', 'forming rm', 'aeds therapy', 'low dose', '2', 'drugs', 'etc', 'low', 'dose', 'rm', 'rm', 'aeds', 'aeds', 'aeds', 'vpa', 'vpa', 'types', 'treatment', 'treatment', 'toxicophores', 'therefore', 'teratogenicity', 'taken', 'seizures', 'rms', 'related', 'priority', 'pk', 'pharmacokinetic', 'n', 'moieties', 'modification', 'minimizing', 'minimize', 'methylsuccinimide', 'metabolites', 'metabolism', 'medication', 'market', 'life', 'lamotrigine', 'immune', 'hepatotoxicity', 'formation', 'form', 'epoxide', 'ensuring', 'en', 'en', 'e', 'dizziness', 'desmethyldiazepam', 'categorized', 'carbamazepine', 'available', 'associated', 'associated', 'appropriate', 'amalgamated', 'adrs', 'additionally', 'addiction', 'acute', '4', '11', '10']"

The best PROTAC TD9 induced human tyrosinase degradation obviously in dose and time-dependent manner, and its mechanism of inducing tyrosinase degradation has also been clearly demonstrated. Besides, encouraging results that low-toxicity PROTAC TD9 was applied to reduce zebrafish melanin synthesis have been obtained, highlighting the potential to treatment of tyrosinase-related disorders.

"The Coronavirus disease, 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which poses a major threat to human life and health. Given its continued development, limiting the spread of COVID-19 in the population remains a challenging task. Currently, multiple therapies are being tried around the world to deal with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a variety of studies have shown that natural products have a significant effect on COVID-19 patients. The combination of SARS-CoV-2 S protein with Angiotensin converting enzyme II(ACE2) of host cell to promote membrane fusion is an initial critical step for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, screening natural products that inhibit the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and ACE2 also provides a feasible strategy for the treatment of COVID-19. Establishment of high throughput screening model is an important basis and key technology for screening S protein-ACE2 blockers. Based on this, the molecular structures of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 and their processes in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and host cell infection were firstly reviewed in this paper, with emphasis on the methods and techniques of screening S protein-ACE2 blockers, including Virtual Screening (VS), Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), Biochromatography, Biotin-avidin with Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent assay and Gene Chip Technology. Furthermore, the technical principle, advantages and disadvantages and application scope were further elaborated. Combined with the application of the above screening technologies in S protein-ACE2 blockers, a variety of natural products, such as flavonoids, terpenoids, phenols, alkaloids, were summarized, which could be used as S protein-ACE2 blockers, in order to provide ideas for the efficient discovery of S protein-ACE2 blockers from natural sources and contribute to the development of broad-spectrum anti coronavirus drugs.","['severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2', 'vs ), surface plasmon resonance', 'spectrum anti coronavirus drugs', 'angiotensin converting enzyme ii', 'high throughput screening model', 'spr ), biochromatography', 'promote membrane fusion', 'linked immunosorbent assay', 'initial critical step', 'gene chip technology', 'including virtual screening', 'ace2 also provides', 'host cell infection', 'screening natural products', 'coronavirus disease', '2 ),', 'host cell', 'natural products', 'natural products', 'key technology', 'screening technologies', '2 infection', '2 infection', 'natural sources', 'tried around', 'technical principle', 'significant effect', 'provide ideas', 'population remains', 'multiple therapies', 'molecular structures', 'major threat', 'life cycle', 'important basis', 'human life', 'firstly reviewed', 'feasible strategy', 'efficient discovery', 'challenging task', 'ace2 blockers', 'ace2 blockers', 'ace2 blockers', 'ace2 blockers', 'ace2 blockers', 'continued development', 'application scope', '19 patients', 'enzyme', 'screening', 'screening', '2', '2', '2', '2', 'ace2', 'ace2', 'development', 'application', '19', '19', '19', 'world', 'variety', 'variety', 'used', 'treatment', 'therefore', 'terpenoids', 'techniques', 'summarized', 'studies', 'spread', 'shown', 'sars', 'sars', 'sars', 'sars', 'sars', 'sars', 'sars', 'protein', 'protein', 'protein', 'protein', 'protein', 'protein', 'protein', 'processes', 'poses', 'phenols', 'paper', 'order', 'methods', 'limiting', 'inhibit', 'health', 'given', 'furthermore', 'flavonoids', 'establishment', 'emphasis', 'elaborated', 'disadvantages', 'deal', 'currently', 'covid', 'covid', 'covid', 'covid', 'cov', 'cov', 'cov', 'cov', 'cov', 'cov', 'cov', 'could', 'contribute', 'combined', 'combination', 'caused', 'broad', 'biotin', 'binding', 'based', 'avidin', 'alkaloids', 'advantages', '2019']"

"Pathogenic bacteria use an intercellular chemical communication system called quorum sensing (QS) to control the expression of cellular functions such as virulence factors, biofilm formation, toxin production, and antibiotic resistance in a manner that is highly dependent on population density. Hence, since the emergence of QS, there has been a great interest in exploiting the QS mechanism as a new drug target. Therefore, blocking the QS mechanism can be an effective strategy to control infection and solve the problem of drug resistance. So far, there is no clinically approved anti-QS drug that can disable the circuits of QS systems.

"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, which is characterized by the primary risk factor, age. Several attempts have been made to treat AD, while most of them end in failure. However, with the deepening study of pathogenesis of AD, the expression of HDAC6 in the hippocampus, which plays a major role of the memory formation, is becoming worth of notice. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), a remarkable lesion in AD, has been characterized in association with the abnormal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated Tau, which is mainly caused by the high expression of HDAC6. On the other hand, the hypoacetylated tubulin induced by HDAC6 is also fatal for the neuronal transport, which is the key impact of the formation of axons and dendrites. Overall, the significantly increased expression of HDAC6 in brain regions is deleterious to neuron survival in AD patients. Based on the above research, the inhibition of HDAC6 seems to be a potential therapeutic method for the treatment of AD. Up to now, various types of HDAC6 inhibitors have been discovered. This review mainly analyzes the HDAC6 inhibitors reported amid 2010-2020 in terms of their structure, selectivity and pharmacological impact towards AD.

"Urea transporters (UTs) have been identified as new targets for diuretics. Functional deletion of UTs led to urea-selective urinary concentrating defects with relative salt sparing. In our previous study, a UT inhibitor with a diarylamide scaffold, which is denoted as 11a, was demonstrated as the first orally available UT inhibitor. However, the oral bioavailability of 11a was only 4.38%, which obstructed its clinical application. In this work, by replacing the nitro group of 11a with an acetyl group, 25a was obtained.

Moreover, the metabolic stability both in vitro and in vivo and the drug-like properties (permeability and solubility) of 25a were obviously improved compared with those of 11a. Moreover, the bioavailability of 25a was 15.18%, which was 3 times higher than that of 11a, thereby resulting in significant enhancement of the diuretic activities in rats and mice. 25a showed excellent potential for development as a promising clinical diuretic candidate for targeting UTs to treat diseases that require long-term usage of diuretics, such as hyponatremia.","['10 times stronger inhibitory effect', 'first orally available ut inhibitor', 'selective urinary concentrating defects', 'much higher inhibition rate', 'promising clinical diuretic candidate', '25a showed excellent potential', '3 times higher', 'relative salt sparing', '48 μm vs', '14 μm vs', 'obviously improved compared', 'ut inhibitor', 'diuretic activities', 'clinical application', '25a showed', '82 μm', '41 μm', 'treat diseases', 'thereby resulting', 'term usage', 'significant enhancement', 'require long', 'previous study', 'nitro group', 'new targets', 'metabolic stability', 'like properties', 'functional deletion', 'diarylamide scaffold', 'acetyl group', '38 %,', '18 %,', 'uts led', 'targeting uts', 'urea transporters', 'oral bioavailability', 'ut', 'ut', 'compared', '25a', '25a', '25a', 'uts', 'urea', 'bioavailability', 'work', 'vivo', 'vitro', 'solubility', 'replacing', 'rats', 'rats', 'permeability', 'obtained', 'obstructed', 'moreover', 'moreover', 'mice', 'mice', 'identified', 'hyponatremia', 'however', 'drug', 'diuretics', 'diuretics', 'development', 'denoted', 'demonstrated', 'b', 'a1', '5', '4', '15', '11a', '11a', '11a', '11a', '11a', '11a', '1', '0', '0']"

From these studies, PP1γ emerged as the most reliable 4e potential target in HUVEC. Molecular docking simulations on PP1γ were carried out to predict 4e binding mode.

"The heat shock response (HSR) is a highly conserved cellular pathway that is responsible for stress relief and the refolding of denatured proteins [1]. When a host cell is exposed to conditions such as heat shock, ischemia, or toxic substances, heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1), a transcription factor, activates the genes that encode for the heat shock proteins (Hsps), which are a family of proteins that work alongside other chaperones to relieve stress and refold proteins that have been denatured (Burdon, 1986) [2]. Along with the refolding of denatured proteins, Hsps facilitate the removal of misfolded proteins by escorting them to degradation pathways, thereby preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins [3]. Research has indicated that many pathological conditions, such as diabetes, cancer, neuropathy, cardiovascular disease, and aging have a negative impact on HSR function and are commonly associated with misfolded protein aggregation [4,5]. Studies indicate an interplay between mitochondrial homeostasis and HSF-1 levels can impact stress resistance, proteostasis, and malignant cell growth, which further support the role of Hsps in pathological and metabolic functions [6]. On the other hand, Hsp activation by specific small molecules can induce the heat shock response, which can afford neuroprotection and other benefits [7]. This review will focus on the modulation of Hsps and the HSR as therapeutic options to treat these conditions.","['highly conserved cellular pathway', 'specific small molecules', 'heat shock response', 'heat shock response', 'malignant cell growth', 'misfolded protein aggregation', 'heat shock factor', 'impact stress resistance', 'heat shock proteins', 'many pathological conditions', 'heat shock', 'transcription factor', 'negative impact', 'host cell', 'stress relief', 'relieve stress', 'misfolded proteins', 'misfolded proteins', 'work alongside', 'toxic substances', 'thereby preventing', 'therapeutic options', 'studies indicate', 'refold proteins', 'mitochondrial homeostasis', 'metabolic functions', 'hsp activation', 'degradation pathways', 'commonly associated', 'cardiovascular disease', 'afford neuroprotection', '7 ].', '6 ].', '5 ].', '3 ].', '2 ].', '1 levels', '1 ].', '1 ),', 'denatured proteins', 'denatured proteins', 'hsps facilitate', 'hsps ),', 'hsr function', 'proteins', 'pathological', '1', 'denatured', 'conditions', 'conditions', 'hsps', 'hsps', 'hsr', 'hsr', 'treat', 'support', 'role', 'review', 'responsible', 'research', 'removal', 'refolding', 'refolding', 'proteostasis', 'neuropathy', 'modulation', 'ischemia', 'interplay', 'induce', 'indicated', 'hsf', 'hsf', 'hand', 'genes', 'focus', 'family', 'exposed', 'escorting', 'encode', 'diabetes', 'chaperones', 'cancer', 'burdon', 'benefits', 'along', 'aging', 'activates', 'accumulation', '4', '1986']"

"Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play an important role in regulating the expression of genes involved in tumorigenesis and tumor maintenance, and hence they have been considered as key targets in cancer therapy. As a novel category of antitumor agents, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) can induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation in cancer cells, ultimately combating cancer. Although in the United States, the use of HDACis for the treatment of certain cancers has been approved, the therapeutic efficacy of HDACis as a single therapeutic agent in solid tumorshas been unsatisfactory and drug resistance may yet occur. To enhance therapeutic efficacy and limit drug resistance, numerous combination therapies involving HDACis in synergy with other antitumor therapies have been studied. In this review, we describe the classification of HDACs. Moreover, we summarize the antitumor mechanism of the HDACis for targeting key cellular processes of cancers (cell cycle, apoptosis, angiogenesis, DNA repair, and immune response). In addition, we outline the major developments of other antitumor therapies in combination with HDACis, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, phototherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.

"Inherited blinding diseases retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and a subset of Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA) are caused by the misfolding and mistrafficking of rhodopsin molecules, which aggregate and accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to photoreceptor cell death. One potential therapeutic strategy to prevent the loss of photoreceptors in these conditions is to identify opsin-binding compounds that act as chemical chaperones for opsin, aiding its proper folding and trafficking to the outer cell membrane. Aiming to identify novel compounds with such effect, a rational ligand-based approach was applied to the structure of the visual pigment chromophore, 11-cis-retinal, and its locked analogue 11-cis-6mr-retinal. Following molecular docking studies on the main chromophore binding site of rhodopsin, 49 novel compounds were synthesized according to optimized one-to seven-step synthetic routes.

Two RBP4 antagonists, specifically tinlarebant (Belite Bio) and STG-001 (Stargazer) are currently undergoing clinical trials. Some antidiabetic drugs and nutraceuticals have been reported to reduce RBP4 expression, but more clinical data is needed to evaluate their therapeutical benefits. As regulating RBP4 levels or its activities would benefit a wide range of patients, further research is highly recommended to develop clinically useful RBP4 antagonists or protein synthesis inhibitors.","['develop clinically useful rbp4 antagonists', 'demonstrated promising safety profiles', 'currently undergoing clinical trials', 'type 2 diabetes', 'including insulin resistance', 'activities would benefit', 'protein synthesis inhibitors', 'protein synthesis inhibitors', 'binding protein 4', 'two rbp4 antagonists', 'several rbp4 antagonists', 'potential therapeutic benefits', 'regulating rbp4 levels', 'reduce rbp4 expression', 'rbp4 antagonists', 'clinical data', 'serum protein', 'therapeutical benefits', 'wide range', 'transports vitamin', 'specifically tinlarebant', 'numerous diseases', 'metabolic syndromes', 'macular degeneration', 'highly recommended', 'especially bpn', 'cardiovascular diseases', 'belite bio', 'antidiabetic drugs', 'animal studies', 'rbp4', 'rbp4', 'rbp4', 'stg', 'stargazer', 'retinol', 'research', 'reported', 'regulate', 'recently', 'patients', 'obesity', 'nutraceuticals', 'needed', 'evaluate', 'effect', 'development', 'correlated', '14136', '001']"
"To construct an artificial low-density lipoprotein (aLDL) that highly mimics low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in vivo, and deliver vincristine (VCR) - doxorubicin (DOX) simultaneously, the 100 nm and 35 nm DOX-VCR-aLDLs (DV-aLDLs) were constructed, then the physicochemical characteristics were evaluated.

The GLASS (GPCR-Ligand Association) database was screened using a pharmacophore model. The most promising novel ligand structures were chosen and then tested in cellular assays (calcium mobilization and β-arrestin assays). Amongst the selected ligands, two pyrrolidinone compounds (7 and 8) turned out to be the most active. Moreover compound 7 was able to reduce the number of adherent neutrophils in a human neutrophil static adhesion assay which indicates its anti-inflammatory and proresolving properties. Further exploration and optimization of new ligands showed that heterocyclic rings, e.g. pyrazole directly connected to the pyrrolidinone scaffold, provide good stability and a boost in the agonistic activity. The compounds of most interest (7 and 30) were tested in an ERK phosphorylation assay, demonstrating selectivity towards FPR2 over FPR1.

"Indomethacin (INM), a well-known non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, has recently gained attention for its antiviral activity demonstrated in drug repurposing studies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although the mechanism of action of INM is not yet fully understood, recent studies have indicated that it acts at an early stage of the coronaviruses (CoVs) replication cycle. In addition, a proteomic study reported that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of INM could be also ascribed to its ability to inhibit human prostaglandin E synthase type 2 (PGES-2), a host protein which interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 NSP7 protein. Although INM does not potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in infected Vero E6 cells, here we have explored for the first time the application of the Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) technology in order to develop more potent INM-derived PROTACs with anti-CoV activity. In this study, we report the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a series of INM-based PROTACs endowed with antiviral activity against a panel of human CoVs, including different SARS-CoV-2 strains. Two PROTACs showed a strong improvement in antiviral potency compared to INM. Molecular modelling studies support human PGES-2 as a potential target of INM-based antiviral PROTACs, thus paving the way toward the development of host-directed anti-CoVs strategies.

Therefore, the search for AChE inhibitors for drug development is ongoing. The enzymatic pocket of AChE has long been the target of several drug designs over the last two decades. The peripheral and catalytic sites of AChE are simultaneously bound by several dimeric molecules, enabling more-efficient inhibition.

"Poor selectivity, potential systemic toxicity and drug resistance are the main challenges associated with chemotherapeutic drugs. MCT1 and MCT4 and LAT1 play vital roles in tumour metabolism and growth by taking up nutrients and are thus potential targets for tumour therapy. An increasing number of studies have shown the feasibility of including these transporters as components of tumour-targeting therapy. Here, we summarize the recent progress in MCT1-, MCT4-and LAT1-based therapeutic strategies. First, protein structures, expression, relationships with cancer, and substrate characteristics are introduced. Then, different drug targeting and delivery strategies using these proteins have been reviewed, including designing protein inhibitors, prodrugs and nanoparticles.

"Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a key drug target for B-cell related malignancies. Irreversible covalent BTK inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of B-cell malignancies, yet BTK C481S mutation at the covalent binding site has caused drug-resistance of BTK covalent binding inhibitors. The proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) technology increases the sensitivity to drug-resistant targets compared to classic inhibitors, which provides a new strategy for mutant BTK related B-cell malignancies. ARQ531, a reversible non-covalent BTK inhibitor that inhibits wild type (WT) and mutated BTK with high selectivity, could be an ideal warhead for PROTACs targeting the mutant BTK. Herein, we designed a novel series of PROTACs using the selective non-covalent BTK inhibitor ARQ531 as warhead, with the goal of improving the degradation of both wild-type and C481S mutant BTKs, and increasing the selectivity of BTK over other kinases. This effort will provide some basis for further preclinical study of BTK PROTACs as a novel strategy for treatment of B-cell lymphomas.","['yet btk c481s mutation', 'irreversible covalent btk inhibitors', 'btk covalent binding inhibitors', 'covalent btk inhibitor arq531', 'mutant btk related b', 'covalent binding site', 'covalent btk inhibitor', 'c481s mutant btks', 'resistant targets compared', 'proteolysis targeting chimera', 'cell related malignancies', 'key drug target', 'inhibits wild type', 'mutant btk', 'classic inhibitors', 'mutated btk', 'btk protacs', 'cell malignancies', 'cell malignancies', 'protacs targeting', 'cell lymphomas', 'tyrosine kinase', 'technology increases', 'selective non', 'reversible non', 'protacs using', 'preclinical study', 'novel strategy', 'novel series', 'new strategy', 'caused drug', 'ideal warhead', 'high selectivity', 'btk', 'btk', 'arq531', 'wild', 'type', 'drug', 'b', 'b', 'b', 'warhead', 'selectivity', 'wt', 'treatment', 'treatment', 'sensitivity', 'resistance', 'provides', 'provide', 'protac', 'kinases', 'increasing', 'improving', 'herein', 'goal', 'effort', 'designed', 'degradation', 'could', 'bruton', 'basis', 'approved']"
"The Hippo pathway is involved in organ size control and tissue homeostasis by regulating cell growth, proliferation and apoptosis. It controls the phosphorylation of the transcription co-activator YAP (Yes associated protein) and TAZ (Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif) in order to control their nuclear import and their interaction with TEAD (Transcriptional Enhanced Associated Domain). YAP, TAZ and TEADs are dysregulated in several cancers making YAP/TAZ-TEAD interaction a new emerging anti-cancer target. We report the synthesis of a set of trisubstituted pyrazoles which bind to hTEAD2 at the interface 2 revealing for the first time a cryptic pocket created by the movement of the phenol ring of Y382. Compound 6 disrupts YAP/TAZ-TEAD interaction in HEK293T cells and inhibits TEAD target genes and cell proliferation in MDA-MB-231 cells. Compound 6 is therefore the first inhibitor of YAP/TAZ-TEAD targeting interface 2.

Carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1) inhibitors have recently been validated as therapeutic agents in neuropathic pain and as antitumor agents. We report the synthesis of new organochalcogenides bearing the benzensulfonamide moiety acting as potent inhibitors of several human CA isoforms and, in particular, against hCA II and VII endowed with potent neuropathic pain attenuating effects. Moreover, in combination with cisplatin or doxorubicin, some of the new CA inhibitors enhanced the effects of the anticancer drugs capability in counteracting breast cancer MCF7 cell viability.

"A DNA intercalating agent Amonafide interferes with topoisomerase 2 (Topo II) activity and prevents re-ligation of DNA strands, leading to double strand breaks (DSB). If DSB repair fails, cells stop dividing and eventually die. In a search of approaches to enhance anti-cancer activities of Topo II inhibitors, we hypothesized that introduction of additional damage in proximity to the DSB may suppress DNA repair and enhance cancer cell killing. Accordingly, chimeric molecules were created that target a DNA alkylating component to the proximity of Topo II-induced DSBs. These chimeras consist of Amonafide or its 4-amino isomer, and DNA methylating methyl triazene moiety Azene protected with a carbamate group, connected via linker. Treatment of cancer cells with the chimeric molecules leads to significantly higher number of DSBs, which were repaired slower compared to Amonafide or monomethyl triazene-treated cells. On the other hand, methyl triazene linked to non-intercalating Amonafide analogs was ineffective. Together, these data strongly support our hypothesis. In line with increased DSBs, the chimeric molecules exhibited significantly higher antiproliferative activity in cancer cell lines compared to Amonafide or monomethyl triazene constituent Azene. We utilized the fluorescent properties of chimera Amonafidazene to develop ''photo-switchable'' reporting system to monitor the prodrug activation. Using this approach, we found that the chimera accumulated and was activated at the tumor sites specifically and demonstrated significantly stronger tumor suppressing activities compared to Amonafide in a xenograft model. Therefore, targeting alkylating groups to the proximity of DSB sites may become an effective approach towards enhancing anti-cancer activities of inhibitors of topoisomerases.","['demonstrated significantly stronger tumor suppressing activities compared', 'dna methylating methyl triazene moiety azene protected', 'chimeric molecules exhibited significantly higher antiproliferative activity', 'effective approach towards enhancing anti', 'dsb may suppress dna repair', 'dna intercalating agent amonafide interferes', 'monomethyl triazene constituent azene', ""switchable '' reporting system"", 'dsb sites may become', 'cancer cell lines compared', 'enhance cancer cell killing', 'significantly higher number', 'methyl triazene linked', 'tumor sites specifically', 'chimeric molecules leads', 'repaired slower compared', 'dsb repair fails', 'dna alkylating component', ""develop '' photo"", 'targeting alkylating groups', 'intercalating amonafide analogs', 'double strand breaks', 'data strongly support', 'connected via linker', 'cells stop dividing', 'chimeric molecules', 'monomethyl triazene', 'topo ii inhibitors', 'enhance anti', 'cancer activities', 'cancer activities', 'dna strands', 'dsb ).', 'cancer cells', 'topo ii', 'topo ii', 'treated cells', 'xenograft model', 'topoisomerase 2', 'prodrug activation', 'fluorescent properties', 'eventually die', 'chimeras consist', 'chimera amonafidazene', 'chimera accumulated', 'carbamate group', 'amino isomer', 'additional damage', 'activity', 'induced dsbs', 'increased dsbs', 'approach', 'inhibitors', 'amonafide', 'amonafide', 'amonafide', 'amonafide', 'dsbs', 'utilized', 'using', 'treatment', 'topoisomerases', 'together', 'therefore', 'target', 'search', 'proximity', 'proximity', 'proximity', 'prevents', 'non', 'monitor', 'line', 'ligation', 'leading', 'introduction', 'ineffective', 'hypothesized', 'hypothesis', 'hand', 'found', 'created', 'approaches', 'activated', 'accordingly', '4']"

"Inflammation is a most complex pathological process that gives birth to different diseases. Different inflammatory mediators are released during an inflammation responsible for acute pain and chronic inflammatory diseases like cancer, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. The arachidonic acid pathway, which results in the production of inflammatory mediators, provides several targets for anti-inflammatory intervention. The most popularly used medications for inflammation are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) but it has some limitations, in particular traditional NSAIDs which inhibit the COX pathway non-selectively, producing gastrointestinal side effects, and other adverse effects like stroke and renal failure. On the other hand, selective COX-2 inhibitors commonly known as 'coxibs' produce cardiovascular side effects. Frequent inhibition of either cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase enzyme switches the metabolism of arachidonic acid from one to another which could lead to serious consequences. Therefore, a need to develop novel, effective and safe anti-inflammatory agents which can inhibit the release of both prostaglandins and leukotrienes from the respective cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways has emerged. This resulted in the discovery of new anti-inflammatory agents derived from natural and synthetic sources as dual COX-2/5-LOX inhibitors. To further contribute towards the discovery in this field, we have attempted to summarize structural features and pharmacological activities of heterocyclic scaffolds and natural products explored as dual COX-2/5-LOX inhibitors. We have emphasized the designing of the dual inhibitors inspired by the previously reported COX-2 and 5-LOX inhibitors.

"The widespread and repeated use of broad-spectrum bactericides has led to an increase in resistance. Developing novel broad-spectrum bactericides cannot solve the resistance problem, and may even aggravate it. The design of specific and selective bactericides has become urgent. A specific bactericidal design strategy was proposed by introducing exogenous metabolites in this study. This strategy was used to optimize two known antibacterial agents, luteolin (M) and Isoprothiolane (D), against Xoo. Based on the prodrug principles, target compound MB and DB were synthesized by combing M or D with exogenous metabolites, respectively. Bactericidal activity test results demonstrated that while the antibacterial ability of target compounds was significantly improved, their selectivity was also well enhanced by the introducing of exogenous metabolites. Comparing with the original compound, the antibacterial activity of target compound was significantly increased 92.0% and 74.5%, respectively. The optimized target compounds were more easily absorbed, and the drug application concentrations were much lower than those of the original agents, which would greatly reduce environmental pollution and relieve resistance risk. Our proposed strategy is of great significance for exploring the specific and selective bactericides against other pathogens.","['would greatly reduce environmental pollution', 'bactericidal activity test results demonstrated', 'optimize two known antibacterial agents', 'spectrum bactericides cannot solve', 'specific bactericidal design strategy', 'may even aggravate', 'drug application concentrations', 'also well enhanced', 'significantly increased 92', 'relieve resistance risk', 'optimized target compounds', 'developing novel broad', '5 %, respectively', 'target compound mb', 'introducing exogenous metabolites', 'antibacterial activity', 'spectrum bactericides', 'original agents', 'target compounds', 'antibacterial ability', 'target compound', 'exogenous metabolites', 'exogenous metabolites', 'significantly improved', 'selective bactericides', 'selective bactericides', 'original compound', 'resistance problem', 'repeated use', 'prodrug principles', 'much lower', 'great significance', 'easily absorbed', 'become urgent', 'proposed strategy', 'design', 'strategy', 'specific', 'specific', 'respectively', 'resistance', 'introducing', 'broad', 'proposed', 'xoo', 'widespread', 'used', 'synthesized', 'study', 'selectivity', 'pathogens', 'luteolin', 'led', 'isoprothiolane', 'increase', 'exploring', 'db', 'comparing', 'combing', 'based', '74', '0', '),']"
"Human sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) plays pivotal roles in metabolic pathways and other biological processes, and is involved in several human diseases including cancer. Development of new potent and selective SIRT5 inhibitors is currently desirable to provide potential therapeutics for related diseases. Herein, we report a series of new 3-thioureidopropanoic acid derivatives, which were designed to mimic the binding features of SIRT5 glutaryl-lysine substrates. Structure-activity relationship studies revealed several compounds with low micromolar inhibitory activities to SIRT5. Computational and biochemical studies indicated that these compounds exhibited competitive SIRT5 inhibition with respect to the glutaryl-lysine substrate rather than nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide cofactor. Moreover, they showed high selectivity for SIRT5 over SIRT1-3 and 6 and could stabilize SIRT5 proteins as revealed by thermal shift analyses. This work provides an effective substrate-mimicking strategy for future inhibitor design, and offers new inhibitors to investigate their therapeutic potentials in SIRT5-associated disease models.","['activity relationship studies revealed several compounds', 'several human diseases including cancer', 'compounds exhibited competitive sirt5 inhibition', 'nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide cofactor', 'low micromolar inhibitory activities', 'could stabilize sirt5 proteins', 'biochemical studies indicated', 'human sirtuin 5', 'thioureidopropanoic acid derivatives', 'thermal shift analyses', 'showed high selectivity', 'provide potential therapeutics', 'plays pivotal roles', 'future inhibitor design', 'associated disease models', 'offers new inhibitors', 'selective sirt5 inhibitors', 'lysine substrate rather', 'related diseases', 'lysine substrates', 'effective substrate', 'new potent', 'work provides', 'therapeutic potentials', 'mimicking strategy', 'metabolic pathways', 'currently desirable', 'biological processes', 'binding features', 'new 3', 'sirt5 glutaryl', 'revealed', 'sirt5', 'sirt5', 'sirt5', 'sirt5', 'glutaryl', '3', 'structure', 'sirt1', 'series', 'respect', 'report', 'moreover', 'mimic', 'involved', 'investigate', 'herein', 'development', 'designed', 'computational', '6']"
"The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) exert vital function in the regulation of energy metabolism, which were considered as promising targets of metabolic syndrome.

"Transient receptor potential melastatin 2 (TRPM2) channel is associated with ischemia/reperfusion injury, inflammation, cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the lack of specific inhibitors impedes the development of TRPM2 targeted therapeutic agents. To develop a selective TRPM2 inhibitor, three-dimensional similarity-based screening strategy was employed using the energy-minimized conformation of non-selective TRPM2 inhibitor 2-APB as the query structure, which resulted in the discovery of a novel tricyclic TRPM2 inhibitor Z-4 with benzo[d]imidazo[1,2-a]imidazole skeleton. A series of Z-4 derivatives were subsequently synthesized and evaluated using calcium imaging and electrophysiology approaches. Among them, preferred compounds ZA10 and ZA18 inhibited the TRPM2 channel with micromolar half-maximal inhibitory concentration values and exhibited TRPM2 selectivity over the TRPM8 channel, TRPV1 channel, InsP","['transient receptor potential melastatin 2', 'novel tricyclic trpm2 inhibitor z', 'maximal inhibitory concentration values', 'trpm2 targeted therapeutic agents', 'evaluated using calcium imaging', 'selective trpm2 inhibitor 2', 'selective trpm2 inhibitor', 'exhibited trpm2 selectivity', 'specific inhibitors impedes', 'preferred compounds za10', 'based screening strategy', 'employed using', 'trpm2 channel', 'za18 inhibited', 'subsequently synthesized', 'reperfusion injury', 'query structure', 'neurodegenerative diseases', 'minimized conformation', 'micromolar half', 'imidazole skeleton', 'electrophysiology approaches', 'dimensional similarity', 'trpv1 channel', 'trpm8 channel', '4 derivatives', '2', 'trpm2', 'z', 'channel', '4', 'three', 'series', 'resulted', 'non', 'lack', 'ischemia', 'insp', 'inflammation', 'imidazo', 'however', 'energy', 'discovery', 'development', 'develop', 'cancer', 'benzo', 'associated', 'apb', 'among', '1']"
"5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) and its prodrugs are the essential clinical drugs for colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment. However, the drug resistance of 5-FU has caused high mortality of CRC patients. Thus, it is urgent to develop reversal agents of 5-FU resistance. Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) was proved to be a potential target for reversing 5-FU resistance, but the activity of known S1PR2 antagonists JTE-013 were weak in 5-FU-resistant cell lines. To develop more potent S1PR2 antagonists to treat 5-FU-resistant cancer, a series of JTE-013 derivatives were designed and synthesized. The most promising compound 40 could markedly reverse the resistance in 5-FU-resistant HCT116 cells and 5-FU-resistant SW620 cells via inhibiting the expression of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). The key was that compound 40 with improved pharmacokinetic properties significantly increased the inhibitory rate of 5-FU in the SW620/5-FU cells xenograft model with no observable toxicity by inhibiting the expression of DPD in tumor and liver tissues. Altogether, these results suggest that compound 40 may be a promising drug candidate to reverse 5-FU resistance in the treatment of CRC.","['promising compound 40 could markedly reverse', 'improved pharmacokinetic properties significantly increased', 'resistant sw620 cells via inhibiting', 'fu cells xenograft model', 'known s1pr2 antagonists jte', 'compound 40 may', 'resistant hct116 cells', 'promising drug candidate', 'resistant cell lines', 'potent s1pr2 antagonists', 'phosphate receptor 2', 'essential clinical drugs', 'caused high mortality', 'develop reversal agents', 'compound 40', 'reverse 5', 'resistant cancer', 'drug resistance', 'results suggest', 'potential target', 'observable toxicity', 'liver tissues', 'inhibitory rate', 'dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase', 'colorectal cancer', 'dpd ).', '013 derivatives', 'fu resistance', 'fu resistance', 'fu resistance', 'crc patients', 'treat 5', 'reversing 5', 'sw620', 'inhibiting', 's1pr2', 'jte', 'develop', 'resistance', 'fu', 'fu', 'fu', 'fu', 'fu', 'fu', 'fu', 'dpd', '013', 'crc', 'crc', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5', 'weak', 'urgent', 'tumor', 'treatment', 'treatment', 'thus', 'synthesized', 'sphingosine', 'series', 'proved', 'prodrugs', 'key', 'however', 'fluorouracil', 'expression', 'expression', 'designed', 'altogether', 'activity', '1']"

"Protease-targeted chimeras (PROTACs) are a new technology that is receiving much attention in the treatment of diseases. The mechanism is to inhibit protein function by hijacking the ubiquitin E3 ligase for protein degradation. Heterogeneous bifunctional PROTACs contain a ligand for recruiting E3 ligase, a linker, and another ligand to bind to the target protein for degradation. A variety of small-molecule PROTACs (CRBN, VHL, IAPs, MDM2, DCAF15, DCAF16, and RNF114-based PROTACs) have been identified so far. In particular, CRBN-based PROTACs (e.g., ARV-110 and ARV-471) have received more attention for their promising therapeutic intervention. To date, CRBN-based PRTOACs have been extensively explored worldwide and have excelled not only in cancer diseases but also in cardiovascular diseases, immune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and viral infections. In this review, we will provide a comprehensive update on the latest research progress in CRBN-based PRTOACs area.

"Protein kinases are central mediators of signal-transduction cascades and attractive drug targets for therapeutic intervention. Since kinases are structurally and mechanistically related to each other, kinase inhibitor selectivity is often investigated by kinase profiling and considered as an important index for drug discovery. We here describe a versatile web server termed ProfKin for structure-based kinase profiling, which is based on a kinase-ligand focused database (KinLigDB). It provides all ready-to-use 3D structure coordinates of 4219 kinase-ligand complex structures covering 297 human kinases and the associated information, particularly including binding site type, binding ligand type, interaction fingerprints, downstream molecules and related human diseases. The web server works via predicting possible binding modes for the query molecule, prioritizing the binding modes guided by an interaction fingerprint analysis method, and giving a list of ranked kinases by a comprehensive index. Users can freely select entire or part of the KinLigDB database, e.g. via subfamily and binding site type, to customize the profiling contents. The superimpositions of the predicted binding poses of the query molecule with reference binding modes can be visually inspected on the website.

"The identification of ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes as photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the treatment of cancer is progressing rapidly. Due to their favorable photophysical and photochemical properties, Ru(II)-based photosensitizers have absorption in the visible spectrum, can be irradiated via one- and two-photon excitation within the PDT window, and yield potent oxygen-dependent and/or oxygen-independent photobiological activities. Herein, we present a current overview of the mechanisms of action and subcellular localization of Ru(II)-based photosensitizers in the treatment of cancer.

"Systemic inflammatory response syndrome is a major feature of sepsis which is one of the major causes of death worldwide. It has been reported that 3,5-diaryl-4,5-dihydropyrazole and thiazole derivatives have many biological functions, especially in the aspect of anti-inflammation. According to the strategy of pharmacophore combination, we introduced thiazole moiety into dihydropyrazole skeleton to design and synthesize a novel series of 2-(3,5-diphenyl-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-methylthiazole derivatives, and evaluated their anti-inflammatory activities for sepsis treatment.

From more than 50,000 unique substituents, frequently used R-groups were identified. For these R-groups, preferred replacements over more than 60,000 individual substitution sites were identified with the aid of a network data structure.

In the last years, several efforts have been devoted to shortening and improving treatment outcomes, and to overcoming the increasing resistance phenomenon. Nature has always provided a virtually unlimited source of bioactive molecules, which have inspired the development of new drugs. NPs are characterized by an exceptional chemical and structural diversity, the result of millennia of evolutionary responses to various stimuli. Thanks to their favorable structural features and their enzymatic origin, they are naturally prone to bind proteins and exhibit bioactivities.

"Mechanical allodynia, a painful sensation caused by innocuous touch, is a major chronic pain symptom, which often remains without an effective treatment. There is thus a need for new anti-allodynic treatments based on new drug classes. We recently synthetized new 3,5-disubstituted pyridin-2(1H)-one derivatives. By substituting the pyridinone at the 3-position by various aryl/heteroaryl moieties and at the 5-position by a phenylamino group, we discovered that some derivatives exhibited a strong anti-allodynic potency in rats. Here, we report that varying the substitution of the pyridinone 5-position, the 3-position being substituted by an indol-4-yl moiety, further improves such anti-allodynic potency. Compared with 2, one of the two most active compounds of the first series, eleven out of nineteen newly synthetized compounds showed higher anti-allodynic potency, with two of them completely preventing mechanical allodynia. In the first series, hit compounds 1 and 2 appeared to be inhibitors of p38α MAPK, a protein kinase known to underlie pain hypersensitivity in animal models. Depending on the substitution at the 5-position, some newly synthetized compounds were also stronger p38α MAPK inhibitors. Surprisingly, though, anti-allodynic effects and p38α MAPK inhibitory potencies were not correlated, suggesting that other biological target(s) is/are involved in the analgesic activity in this series. Altogether, these results confirm that 3,5-disubstituted pyridine-2(1H)-one derivatives are of high interest for the development of new treatment of mechanical allodynia.","['nineteen newly synthetized compounds showed higher anti', 'also stronger p38α mapk inhibitors', 'major chronic pain symptom', 'p38α mapk inhibitory potencies', '1h )- one derivatives', '1h )- one derivatives', 'newly synthetized compounds', 'completely preventing mechanical allodynia', 'recently synthetized new 3', 'hit compounds 1', 'underlie pain hypersensitivity', 'protein kinase known', 'painful sensation caused', 'often remains without', 'new drug classes', 'allodynic treatments based', 'p38α mapk', 'active compounds', 'new anti', 'derivatives exhibited', 'mechanical allodynia', 'mechanical allodynia', 'new treatment', 'strong anti', 'allodynic potency', 'allodynic potency', 'allodynic potency', 'allodynic effects', 'yl moiety', 'various aryl', 'results confirm', 'phenylamino group', 'innocuous touch', 'high interest', 'heteroaryl moieties', 'effective treatment', 'disubstituted pyridine', 'disubstituted pyridin', 'biological target', 'animal models', 'analgesic activity', 'first series', 'first series', '2 appeared', 'one', 'inhibitors', 'pyridinone 5', 'anti', 'anti', '3', '3', '3', 'series', 'pyridinone', '2', '2', '2', '5', '5', '5', '5', 'varying', 'two', 'two', 'thus', 'though', 'surprisingly', 'suggesting', 'substitution', 'substitution', 'substituting', 'substituted', 'report', 'rats', 'position', 'position', 'position', 'position', 'position', 'need', 'involved', 'indol', 'improves', 'eleven', 'discovered', 'development', 'depending', 'correlated', 'compared', 'altogether', '4']"

Multiple NDM-1 inhibitors have been designed and tested; however, due to the complexity of the NDM-1 active site, there is currently no inhibitor on the market. Consequently, an infection caused by bacteria possessing the gene for the NDM-1 enzyme is a serious and potentially fatal complication.

Herein, potent in vitro anticancer activity against two established medulloblastoma cell lines of the sonic hedgehog subgroup, namely DAOY (p53 mutant) and ONS-76 (p53 wild type), has been achieved. A number of first-generation diarylamides and diarylureas were evaluated and activity is likely to be, in-part, conformation-dependent. The most active compound from this first-generation set of compounds, 1-naphthyl derivative 4b, was selected and a second-generation of compounds were optimised and tested for activity against the medulloblastoma cell lines. This process resulted in drug-like compounds with up to sixty times the activity (sub-micromolar) of the first-generation - thus providing potent new leads for further study.","['thus providing potent new leads', 'two established medulloblastoma cell lines', 'grade childhood embryonal tumour', 'p53 wild type ),', 'medulloblastoma cell lines', 'sonic hedgehog subgroup', 'naphthyl derivative 4b', 'childhood brain tumours', 'central nervous system', 'vitro anticancer activity', 'p53 mutant', 'heterogeneous tumours', 'sixty times', 'process resulted', 'namely daoy', 'highly aggressive', 'common high', 'active compound', 'generation set', 'generation diarylamides', 'like compounds', 'potent', 'medulloblastoma', 'generation', 'generation', 'activity', 'activity', 'activity', 'compounds', 'compounds', 'tested', 'sub', 'study', 'selected', 'second', 'part', 'optimised', 'ons', 'number', 'micromolar', 'likely', 'herein', 'first', 'first', 'first', 'evaluated', 'drug', 'diarylureas', 'dependent', 'conformation', 'cerebellum', 'achieved', 'account', '76', '20', '15', '1']"
"Protease activated receptor 4 (PAR4) is an important target in antiplatelet therapy to reduce the risk of heart attack and thrombotic complications in stroke. PAR4 antagonists can prevent harmful and stable thrombus growth, while retaining initial thrombus formation, by acting on the late diffusion stage of platelet aggregation, and may provide a safer alternative to other antiplatelet agents. To date, only two PAR4 antagonists, BMS-986120 and BMS-986141 have entered clinical trials for thrombosis. Thus, the development of a potent and selective PAR4 antagonist with a novel chemotype is highly desirable. In this study, we explored the activity of quinazolin-4(3H)-one-based PAR4 antagonists, beginning with their IDT analogues. By repeated structural optimisation, we developed a series of highly selective PAR4 antagonists with nanomolar potency on human platelets.

"A series of 5-phenylthiophene derivatives with novel structures were designed and synthesized to combat the increasing incidence of susceptible and drug-resistant fungal infections. The antifungal activity of the synthesized compounds was assessed against seven susceptible strains and six fluconazole-resistant strains. It is especially encouraging that compounds 17b and 17f displayed significant antifungal activities against all tested strains. Furthermore, the potent compounds 17b and 17f could prevent the formation of fungi biofilms and 17f displayed satisfactory fungicidal activity. Preliminary mechanistic studies showed that the potent antifungal activity of compound 17f stemmed from inhibition of C. albicans CYP51. In addition, Compounds 17b and 17f were almost nontoxic to mammalian A549, MCF-7, and THLE-2 cells.

"The human transactive responsive (TAR) DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is involved in a number of physiological processes in the body. Its primary function involves RNA regulation. The TDP-43 protein is also involved in many diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and even cancers. These TDP-43 mediated diseases are collectively called as TDP-43 proteinopathies. Intense research in the last decade has increased our understanding on TDP-43 structure and function in biology. The three-dimensional structures of TDP-43 domains such as N-terminal domain (NTD), RNA-recognition motif-1 (RRM1), RNA-recognition motif-2 (RRM2) and the C-terminal domain (CTD) or low-complexity domain (LCD) have been solved. These structures have yielded insights into novel binding sites and pockets at various TDP-43 domains, which can be targeted by designing a diverse library of ligands including small molecules, peptides and oligonucleotides as molecular tools to (i) study TDP-43 function, (ii) develop novel diagnostic agents and (iii) discover disease-modifying therapies to treat TDP-43 proteinopathies. This review provides a summary on recent progress in the development of TDP-43 binding ligands and uses the solved structures of various TDP-43 domains to investigate putative ligand binding regions that can be exploited to discover novel molecular probes to modulate TDP-43 structure and function.","['investigate putative ligand binding regions', 'primary function involves rna regulation', 'develop novel diagnostic agents', 'ligands including small molecules', 'als ), frontotemporal dementia', 'discover novel molecular probes', 'novel binding sites', 'rrm1 ), rna', 'ntd ), rna', 'ftd ), alzheimer', 'ad ), parkinson', '43 binding ligands', 'human transactive responsive', 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'binding protein 43', '43 mediated diseases', 'molecular tools', '43 protein', 'many diseases', '43 function', 'discover disease', '43 structure', '43 structure', '43 proteinopathies', '43 proteinopathies', '43 domains', '43 domains', '43 domains', 'yielded insights', 'terminal domain', 'terminal domain', 'review provides', 'recognition motif', 'recognition motif', 'recent progress', 'physiological processes', 'modifying therapies', 'last decade', 'intense research', 'even cancers', 'diverse library', 'complexity domain', 'collectively called', 'dimensional structures', 'also involved', 'various tdp', 'various tdp', 'treat tdp', 'study tdp', 'modulate tdp', 'solved structures', 'function', 'function', '43', 'structures', 'solved', 'involved', 'tdp', 'tdp', 'tdp', 'tdp', 'tdp', 'tdp', 'tdp', 'disease', 'disease', 'uses', 'understanding', 'three', 'targeted', 'tar', 'summary', 'rrm2', 'pockets', 'peptides', 'pd', 'oligonucleotides', 'number', 'n', 'low', 'lcd', 'increased', 'iii', 'ii', 'exploited', 'dna', 'development', 'designing', 'ctd', 'c', 'body', 'biology', '2', '1']"
"Theranostic prodrug was highly desirable for precise diagnosis and anti-cancer therapy to decrease side effects. However, it is difficult to conjugate chemo-drug and molecular probe for combined therapy due to the complex pharmacokinetics of different molecules. Here, a novel anticancer theranostic prodrug (BTMP-SS-PTX) had been designed and synthesized by conjugating paclitaxel (PTX) with 2-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-4-methoxyphenol (BTMP) through a disulphide (-S-S-) linkage, which was redox-sensitive to the high concentration of glutathione in tumors. Upon activation with glutathione in weakly acid media, the BTMP-SS-PTX can be dissociated to release free PTX and visible BTMP, which realized the visual tracking of free drug. The cytotoxicity study demonstrated that soluble prodrug BTMP-SS-PTX displayed more outstanding anticancer activity in HepG2, MCF-7 and HeLa cells, lower toxicity to non-cancer cells (293 T) than free drugs. Furthermore, BTMP-SS-PTX was still able to induce apoptosis of HeLa cells and significantly inhibited tumor growth in HeLa-xenograft mouse model. On the basis of these findings, BTMP-SS-PTX could play a potential role in cancer diagnosis and therapy.","['significantly inhibited tumor growth', 'novel anticancer theranostic prodrug', 'outstanding anticancer activity', 'yl )- 4', 'xenograft mouse model', 'weakly acid media', 'decrease side effects', 'cytotoxicity study demonstrated', 'combined therapy due', '2 -( benzo', 'ptx could play', 'soluble prodrug btmp', 'release free ptx', 'theranostic prodrug', 'free drugs', 'visual tracking', 'upon activation', 'still able', 'precise diagnosis', 'potential role', 'molecular probe', 'lower toxicity', 'induce apoptosis', 'highly desirable', 'high concentration', 'disulphide (-', 'different molecules', 'conjugating paclitaxel', 'conjugate chemo', 'complex pharmacokinetics', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer cells', '-) linkage', 'free drug', 'ptx displayed', 'hela cells', 'hela cells', 'visible btmp', 'therapy', '2', 'ptx', 'ptx', 'ptx', 'ptx', 'hela', 'drug', 'btmp', 'btmp', 'btmp', 'btmp', 'btmp', 'tumors', 'thiazol', 'synthesized', 'ss', 'ss', 'ss', 'ss', 'ss', 'sensitive', 'redox', 'realized', 'non', 'methoxyphenol', 'mcf', 'however', 'hepg2', 'glutathione', 'glutathione', 'furthermore', 'findings', 'dissociated', 'difficult', 'designed', 'basis', 'anti', '7', '293']"
"Synaptic spine morphology is controlled by the activity of Rac1, Cdc42 and RhoA, which need to be finely balanced, and in particular RhoA/ROCK prevents the formation of new protrusions by stabilizing actin formation. These processes are crucial to the maturation process, slowing the de novo generation of new spines. The RhoA/ROCK also influences plasticity processes, and selective modulation by ROCK1 of MLC-dependent actin dynamics leads to neurite retraction, but not to spine retraction. ROCK1 is also responsible for the reduction of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles. These and other evidences suggest that ROCK1 is the main isoform acting on the presynaptic neuron. On the other hand, ROCK2 seems to have broad effects on LIMK/cofilin-dependent plasticity processes such as cofilin-dependent PSD changes. The RhoA/ROCK pathway is an important factor in several different brain-related pathologies via both downstream and upstream pathways. In the aggregate, these evidences show that the RhoA/ROCK pathway has a central role in the etiopathogenesis of a large group of CNS diseases, which underscores the importance of the pharmacological modulation of RhoA/ROCK as an important pathway to drug discovery in the neurodegenerative disease area. This article aims at providing the first review of the role of compounds acting on the RhoA/ROCK pathway in the control of synaptic disfunction.","['rock also influences plasticity processes', 'dependent actin dynamics leads', 'dependent plasticity processes', 'dependent psd changes', 'several different brain', 'related pathologies via', 'readily releasable pool', 'neurodegenerative disease area', 'de novo generation', 'stabilizing actin formation', 'main isoform acting', 'synaptic spine morphology', 'also responsible', 'spine retraction', 'compounds acting', 'synaptic vesicles', 'synaptic disfunction', 'rock prevents', 'rock pathway', 'rock pathway', 'rock pathway', 'upstream pathways', 'selective modulation', 'rock2 seems', 'presynaptic neuron', 'pharmacological modulation', 'new spines', 'new protrusions', 'neurite retraction', 'maturation process', 'large group', 'important pathway', 'important factor', 'first review', 'finely balanced', 'evidences suggest', 'evidences show', 'drug discovery', 'cns diseases', 'broad effects', 'article aims', 'central role', 'particular rhoa', 'processes', 'rock', 'formation', 'role', 'rhoa', 'rhoa', 'rhoa', 'rhoa', 'rhoa', 'rhoa', 'underscores', 'slowing', 'rock1', 'rock1', 'rock1', 'reduction', 'rac1', 'providing', 'need', 'mlc', 'limk', 'importance', 'hand', 'etiopathogenesis', 'downstream', 'crucial', 'controlled', 'control', 'cofilin', 'cofilin', 'cdc42', 'aggregate', 'activity']"

"Breast Cancer (BC) is a leading cause of death in women, currently affecting 13% of female population worldwide. First-line clinical treatments against Estrogen Receptor positive (ER+) BC rely on suppressing estrogen production, by inhibiting the aromatase (AR) enzyme, or on blocking estrogen-dependent pro-oncogenic signaling, by targeting Estrogen Receptor (ER) α with selective Modulators/Degraders (SERMs/SERDs). The development of dual acting molecules targeting AR and ERα represents a tantalizing alternative strategy to fight ER + BC, reducing the incidence of adverse effects and resistance onset that limit the effectiveness of these gold-standard therapies. Here, in silico design, synthesis, biological evaluation and an atomic-level characterization of the binding and inhibition mechanism of twelve structurally related drug-candidates enable the discovery of multiple compounds active on both AR and ERα in the sub-μM range.

"Biguanides have attracted much attention a century ago and showed resurgent interest in recent years after a long period of dormancy. They constitute an important class of therapeutic agents suitable for the treatment of a wide spectrum of diseases. Therapeutic indications of biguanides include antidiabetic, antimalarial, antiviral, antiplaque, and bactericidal applications. This review presents an extensive overview of the biological activity of biguanides and different mechanisms of action of currently marketed biguanide-containing drugs, as well as their pharmacological properties when applicable. We highlight the recent developments in research on biguanide compounds, with a primary focus on studies on metformin in the field of oncology.

"Oligopeptide boronates with a lipophilic tail are known to inhibit the type I signal peptidase in E. coli, which is a promising drug target for developing novel antibiotics. Antibacterial activity depends on these oligopeptides having a cationic modification to increase their permeation. Unfortunately, this modification is associated with cytotoxicity, motivating the need for novel approaches. The sulfonimidamide functionality has recently gained much interest in drug design and discovery, as a means of introducing chirality and an imine-handle, thus allowing for the incorporation of additional substituents. This in turn can tune the chemical and biological properties, which are here explored. We show that introducing the sulfonimidamide between the lipophilic tail and the peptide in a series of signal peptidase inhibitors resulted in antibacterial activity, while the sulfonamide isostere and previously known non-cationic analogs were inactive. Additionally, we show that replacing the sulfonamide with a sulfonimidamide resulted in decreased cytotoxicity, and similar results were seen by adding a cationic sidechain to the sulfonimidamide motif. This is the first report of incorporation of the sulfonimidamide functional group into bioactive peptides, more specifically into antibacterial oligopeptides, and evaluation of its biological effects.","['recently gained much interest', 'signal peptidase inhibitors resulted', 'promising drug target', 'developing novel antibiotics', 'sulfonimidamide functional group', 'previously known non', 'antibacterial activity depends', 'signal peptidase', 'sulfonimidamide resulted', 'antibacterial activity', 'novel approaches', 'drug design', 'thus allowing', 'sulfonimidamide motif', 'sulfonimidamide functionality', 'similar results', 'oligopeptide boronates', 'lipophilic tail', 'lipophilic tail', 'first report', 'cationic sidechain', 'cationic analogs', 'biological properties', 'biological effects', 'bioactive peptides', 'additional substituents', 'antibacterial oligopeptides', 'sulfonamide isostere', 'introducing chirality', 'decreased cytotoxicity', 'cationic modification', 'sulfonimidamide', 'known', 'sulfonamide', 'oligopeptides', 'modification', 'introducing', 'cytotoxicity', 'unfortunately', 'type', 'turn', 'tune', 'specifically', 'show', 'show', 'series', 'seen', 'replacing', 'permeation', 'peptide', 'need', 'motivating', 'means', 'inhibit', 'increase', 'incorporation', 'incorporation', 'inactive', 'imine', 'handle', 'explored', 'evaluation', 'e', 'discovery', 'coli', 'chemical', 'associated', 'additionally', 'adding']"
"Intestinal commensal fungi are vital to human health, and their secondary metabolites play a key role in the reciprocal relationship. In the present study, the first example of 2,3-seco ergot alkaloids belonging to clavine-type were isolated from the fermentation of human intestinal fungus Aspergillus fumigatus CY018, including two pairs of diastereoisomers, secofumigaclavines A (3) and B (4) and secofumigaclavines C (5) and D (6), one analogue features a highly unsaturated skeleton, secofumigaclavine E (7), along with two known ones, fumigaclavines C (1) and D (2). Their structures were identified based on extensive spectroscopic data in a combination of quantum chemical calculations. Moreover, a single-step operation of semi-synthetic reaction based on riboflavin (RF)-dependent photocatalysis was performed to obtain the novel 2,3-seco ergot alkaloids 3 and 5 from their biosynthetic precursors 1 and 2. All the isolated compounds were evaluated for their anti-inflammatory activity. Among them, secofumigaclavine B (4) could bind to MD2 with a low micromole level of the equilibrium dissociation constant measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and suppress TLR4-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway in RAW264.7 cells, resulting in its anti-inflammatory effect. Molecular dynamics revealed that amino acid residue Tyr131 played a key role in the interaction of secofumigaclavine B (4) with MD2. These findings suggested that secofumigaclavine B (4) could be considered as a potential candidate for the development of MD2 inhibitors.","['human intestinal fungus aspergillus fumigatus cy018', 'amino acid residue tyr131 played', '6 ), one analogue features', 'seco ergot alkaloids belonging', 'rf )- dependent photocatalysis', 'equilibrium dissociation constant measured', 'seco ergot alkaloids 3', 'intestinal commensal fungi', 'κb signaling pathway', 'two known ones', 'surface plasmon resonance', 'secondary metabolites play', 'quantum chemical calculations', 'molecular dynamics revealed', 'low micromole level', 'including two pairs', 'highly unsaturated skeleton', 'extensive spectroscopic data', '7 ), along', 'synthetic reaction based', 'biosynthetic precursors 1', 'human health', 'spr ),', 'identified based', '7 cells', 'suppress tlr4', 'step operation', 'secofumigaclavine e', 'reciprocal relationship', 'present study', 'potential candidate', 'mediated nf', 'key role', 'key role', 'inflammatory effect', 'inflammatory activity', 'fumigaclavines c', 'first example', 'findings suggested', 'secofumigaclavine b', 'secofumigaclavine b', 'secofumigaclavine b', 'secofumigaclavines c', 'novel 2', 'isolated compounds', 'could bind', '2 ).', 'md2 inhibitors', '1', 'b', '3', '3', '3', 'secofumigaclavines', 'isolated', 'could', '2', '2', 'md2', 'md2', 'vital', 'type', 'structures', 'single', 'semi', 'riboflavin', 'resulting', 'raw264', 'performed', 'obtain', 'moreover', 'interaction', 'fermentation', 'evaluated', 'diastereoisomers', 'development', 'considered', 'combination', 'clavine', 'anti', 'anti', 'among', '5', '5', '4', '4', '4', '4']"
"Antimicrobial resistance and cancer are two important problems affecting human health. Actively developing novel antibiotics and anticancer medicines is a priority. Natural pentacyclic triterpenoids have attracted wide attention due to their significant biological activities. In this study, a series of 1,2,3-triazolo fused triterpenoids (betulin, oleanolic acid and ursolic acid) were functionalized on the A-ring by an in-house developed multi-component triazolization reaction. The compounds were investigated for antitumoral activity in twelve cancer cell lines and were also tested for antibacterial activity against four bacteria. In terms of anticancer effects, compounds 5b-f and 8a-d displayed strong cytotoxic activity in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (Capan-1), chronic myeloid leukemia (Hap-1), acute myeloid leukemia (HL-60), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Jurkat) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (Rec-1) cell lines. Among them, compound 5f exhibited the most potent antiproliferative effect on HL-60 cells. Further pharmacological research confirmed that compound 5f caused mitochondrial dysfunction and arrested the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase to induce apoptosis of HL-60 cells. In addition, compound 5f also induced autophagy to inhibit the proliferation of HL-60 cells. Antibacterial screening revealed that compounds 2a-g and 5a-d showed modest activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica) with especially compounds 2c and 2d being potent inhibitors of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica growth.

"The death caused by pathogenic bacteria has always been a severe threat to mankind. The prevalence of drug resistance among bacteria underscores an urgent goal for new antibacterial agents with novel mode of action. Here we first designed and synthesized a class of benzothiazolyl-5-methylphenanthridium derivatives and evaluated their antibacterial activity. On this basis, we further designed and synthesized another class of novel indolyl-5-methylphenanthridium derivatives by optimizing the benzothiazolyl-5-methylphenanthridium core and evaluated their antibacterial activity targeting the bacterial cell division protein FtsZ. The results showed that the indolyl-5-methylphenanthridium derivatives had greatly improved activity against various drug-resistant bacterial strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Among them, compound C5 displayed excellent antibacterial activity against susceptible (MIC = 1 μg/mL), methicillin-resistant and clinical isolated S. aureus (MIC = 2 μg/mL). With low hemolytic activity towards mice red blood cells, C5 exhibited good antibacterial effect in vivo in preliminary pharmacodynamic assay. More importantly, C5 was difficult to induce bacterial resistance. Further mechanism studies proved that C5 could inhibit bacterial cell division by promoting FtsZ polymerization, leading to disorderly polymerization and disordered knots. Therefore, our findings suggest that this class of novel indolyl-5-methylphenanthridium derivatives are promising for future antibacterial agents.","['low hemolytic activity towards mice red blood cells', 'c5 could inhibit bacterial cell division', 'compound c5 displayed excellent antibacterial activity', 'bacterial cell division protein ftsz', 'c5 exhibited good antibacterial effect', 'resistant bacterial strains including methicillin', 'drug resistance among bacteria underscores', 'induce bacterial resistance', 'antibacterial activity targeting', 'greatly improved activity', 'new antibacterial agents', 'future antibacterial agents', 'promoting ftsz polymerization', 'ml ), methicillin', 'preliminary pharmacodynamic assay', 'mechanism studies proved', 'antibacterial activity', 'resistant staphylococcus aureus', 'synthesized another class', 'various drug', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'resistant enterococcus', 'ml ).', 'disorderly polymerization', 'c5', 'vre ).', 'urgent goal', 'severe threat', 'results showed', 'novel mode', 'methylphenanthridium derivatives', 'methylphenanthridium derivatives', 'methylphenanthridium derivatives', 'methylphenanthridium derivatives', 'methylphenanthridium core', 'findings suggest', 'disordered knots', 'death caused', 'clinical isolated', '2 μg', '1 μg', 'novel indolyl', 'novel indolyl', 'first designed', 'among', 'resistant', 'synthesized', 'aureus', 'indolyl', 'class', 'class', 'designed', 'vivo', 'vancomycin', 'therefore', 'susceptible', 'promising', 'prevalence', 'optimizing', 'mic', 'mic', 'mankind', 'leading', 'importantly', 'evaluated', 'evaluated', 'difficult', 'benzothiazolyl', 'benzothiazolyl', 'basis', 'always', 'action', '5', '5', '5', '5', '5']"

Glycosidase inhibition study of DNJ derivatives showed potent and selective inhibitions of α-glucosidase; DNJ derivatives with methyl, pentyl to octyl, undecyl and dodecyl as C-5 branched chains showed significantly improved rat intestinal maltase inhibition.

"Dysregulation of neuroinflammation is a key pathological factor in the progressive neuronal damage of neurodegenerative diseases. An in-house natural products library of 1407 compounds were screened against neuroinflammation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated microglia cells to identify a novel hit 1,6-O,O-diacetylbritannilactone (OABL) with anti-neuroinflammatory activity. Furthermore, a 1,10-seco-eudesmane sesquiterpenoid library containing 33 compounds was constructed by semisynthesis of a major component 1-O-acetylbritannilactone (ABL) from the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Inula Britannica L. Compound 15 was identified as a promising anti-neuroinflammatory agent by nitrite oxide (NO) production screening. 15 could attenuate tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) productions, and inhibit the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) at a submicromolar level. Mechanistic study revealed that 15 significantly modulated TLR4/NF-kB and p38 MAPK pathways, and upregulated the anti-oxidant response HO-1. Besides, 15 promoted the conversion of the microglia from M1 to M2 phenotype by increasing levels of arginase-1 and IL-10. The structure-activity relationships (SARs) analysis indicated that the α-methylene-γ-lactone motifs, epoxidation of C5=C10 bond and bromination of C14 were important to the activity.

"EGFR mutations are an ongoing challenge in the treatment of NSCLC, and demand continuous updating of EGFR TKI drug candidates. Pyrrolopyrimidines are one group of versatile scaffolds suitable for tailored drug development. However not many precedents of this type of pharmacophore have been investigated in the realm of third generation of covalent EGFR-TKIs. Herein, a series of pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives able to block mutant EGFR activity in a covalent manner were synthesized, through optimized Buchwald-Hartwig C-N cross coupling reactions. Their preliminary bioactivity and corresponding inhibitory mechanistic pathways were investigated at molecular and cellular levels. Several compounds exhibited increased biological activity and enhanced selectivity compared to the control compound. Notably, compound 12i selectively inhibits HCC827 cells harboring the EGFR activating mutation with up to 493-fold increased efficacy compared to in normal HBE cells.

"Computer-aided drug design (CADD) is one of the pivotal approaches to contemporary pre-clinical drug discovery, and various computational techniques and software programs are typically used in combination, in a bid to achieve the desired outcome. Several approved drugs have been developed with the aid of CADD. On SciFinder®, we evaluated more than 600 publications through systematic searching and refining, using the terms, virtual screening; software methods; computational studies and publication year, in order to obtain data concerning particular aspects of CADD. The primary focus of this review was on the databases screened, virtual screening and/or molecular docking software program used. Furthermore, we evaluated the studies that subsequently performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and we reviewed the software programs applied, the application of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental assays. To represent the latest trends, the most recent data obtained was between 2015 and 2020, consequently the most frequently employed techniques and software programs were recorded. Among these, the ZINC database was the most widely preferred with an average use of 31.2%. Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) was the most prominently used type of virtual screening and it accounted for an average of 57.6%, with AutoDock being the preferred virtual screening/molecular docking program with 41.8% usage. Following the screening process, 38.5% of the studies performed MD simulations to complement the virtual screening and GROMACS with 39.3% usage, was the popular MD software program. Among the computational techniques, DFT was the least applied whereby it only accounts for 0.02% average use. An average of 36.5% of the studies included reports on experimental evaluations following virtual screening.

"The Staphylococcus aureus can switch to a transient genotype-invariant dormancy, known as a persister, to survive treatment with high doses of antibiotics. This transient persister is an important reason underlying its resistance. There is an urgent need to find new antibacterial agents capable of eradicating methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) persisters. In this study, 37 new derivatives of cajaninstilbene acid (CSA) were designed and synthesized, and their biological activity against MRSA persisters was evaluated. Most of the newly synthesized derivatives exhibit more potent antimicrobial properties against S. aureus and MRSA than CSA itself, and 23 of the 37 derivatives show a tendency to eradicate MRSA persisters. A representative compound (A6) was demonstrated to target bacterial cell membranes. It eradicated the adherent biofilm of MRSA in a concentration dependent manner, and showed a synergistic antibacterial effect with piperacilin. In a model mouse abscess caused by MRSA persisters, A6 effectively reduced the bacterial load in vivo.

Hence, this review highlights the clinical potential of organometallic compounds for the treatment of infections caused by bacteria or fungi in recent five years. The common scaffolds, including antimicrobial peptides, N-heterocyclic carbenes, Schiff bases, photosensitive-grand-cycle skeleton structures, aliphatic amines-based ligands, and special metal-based complexes are summarized here. We also discuss their therapeutic targets and the risks that should be paid attention to in the future studies, aiming to provide information for researchers on metal-based complexes as antimicrobial agents and inspire the design and synthesis of new antimicrobial drugs.","['recent five years', 'higher lipid solubility', 'cycle skeleton structures', 'new antimicrobial drugs', 'including antimicrobial peptides', 'antimicrobial resistance', 'antimicrobial agents', 'therapeutic targets', 'schiff bases', 'review highlights', 'releasing ions', 'provide information', 'paid attention', 'organometallic compounds', 'intractable problem', 'infections caused', 'heterocyclic carbenes', 'future studies', 'common scaffolds', 'cell process', 'biological function', 'based ligands', 'based complexes', 'based complexes', 'based complexes', 'also discuss', 'aliphatic amines', 'special metal', 'metal ions', 'many metal', 'clinical potential', 'metal', 'potential', 'world', 'treatment', 'synthesis', 'summarized', 'risks', 'researchers', 'photosensitive', 'n', 'microorganisms', 'likely', 'inspire', 'hence', 'grand', 'fungi', 'essential', 'design', 'bacteria', 'amr', 'aiming', 'absorbed']"

"Liver cancer most commonly develops in patients with chronic liver disease, the etiology of which includes viral hepatitis (B and C), alcohol, obesity, dietary carcinogens, and so forth. The current treatment modalities, including surgical resection and liver transplantation, have been found far from effective. Hence, there is an obvious critical need to develop alternative strategies for the treatment of it. In this review, we discuss the formation process and therapeutic targets of liver cancer. Currently, targeted therapy is limited to sorafenib, lenvatinib, regorafenib, ramucirumab and cabozantinib which leads to a survival benefit in patients, but on the other hand is hampered by the occurrence of drug resistance. Pleasingly and importantly, there are multiple natural products undergoing clinical evaluation in liver cancer, such as polyphenols like icaritin, resveratrol, and silybin, saponins including ginsenoside Rg3 and glycyrrhizinate, alkaloid containing irinotecan and berberine and inorganic compound arsenic trioxide at present. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that these compounds inhibit liver cancer formation owing to the influence on the anti-viral, anti-inflammation, anti-oxidant, anti-angiogenesis and anti-metastasis activity. Furthermore, a series of small molecule derivatives inspired by the aforementioned compounds are designed and synthesized according to structure-activity relationship studies. Drug combination and novel type of drug-targeted delivery system thereof have been well developed.

"TGFβ is crucial for the homeostasis of epithelial and neural tissues, wound repair, and regulating immune responses. Its dysregulation is associated with a vast number of diseases, of which modifying the tumor microenvironment is one of vital clinical interest. Despite various attempts, there is still no FDA-approved therapy to inhibit the TGFβ pathway. Major mainstream approaches involve impairment of the TGFβ pathway via inhibition of the TGFβRI kinase. With the purpose to identify non-receptor kinase-based inhibitors to impair TGFβ signaling, an in-house chemical library was enriched, through a computational study, to eliminate TGFβRI kinase activity. Selected compounds were screened against a cell line engineered with a firefly luciferase gene under TGFβ-Smad-dependent transcriptional control.

Matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) is expressed by chondrocytes and synovial cells in human OA and is thought to play a critical role in cartilage destruction. Herein we report a new, allosteric MMP-13 inhibitor, AQU-019, that has been optimized for potency, metabolic stability, and oral bioavailability through a combination of structure activity relationship (SAR) and deuterium substitution as a potential disease modifying OA drug (DMOAD).

"Bacteria carrying New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-1 (New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase, NDM-1) resistance gene is a new type of ""superbug"", which can hydrolyze almost all β-lactam antibiotics, rapidly spread among the same species and even spread among different species. NDM-1 belongs to the class B1 broad-spectrum enzyme of β-lactamase. The two positively charged zinc ions in the active center have electrostatic interaction with the hydroxyl ions in them to seize the hydrogen atom near the water molecule to form a bridging ring water molecule, which strengthens its nucleophilicity and attacks the carbonyl group on the lactam ring; thus, catalyzing the hydrolysis of β-lactam antibiotics. Since NDM-1 has an open active site and unique electrostatic structure, it essentially provides a wider range of substrate specificity. Due to its flexible hydrolysis mechanism and more and more variants also aggravate the threat of drug-resistant bacteria infection, there is still no effective inhibitor in clinic, which is a serious threat to human health and public health safety. The electron-rich substituents of NDM-1 inhibitors coordinate with two positively charged zinc ions in the active center of the enzyme through ion-dipole interaction to produce NDM-1 inhibitory activity.

"Helicobacter pylori is one of the main causal risk factor in the generation of chronic gastritis, gastroduodenal ulcers and gastric carcinoma. Thus, the eradication of H. pylori infection is an important way for preventing and managing the gastric diseases. Multiple-therapy with several antibacterial agents is used for the eradication of H. pylori infections; however the increase of resistance to H. pylori strains has resulted in unsatisfactory eradication and unsuccessful treatment. Furthermore, the combination therapy with high dosing leads to the disruption of intestinal microbial flora and undesired side effects. Therefore, the search for new therapeutic agents with high selectivity against H. pylori is a field of current interest. In recent years, diverse compounds originating from natural sources or synthetic drug design programs were evaluated and tried to optimize for applying against H. pylori. In this review, we have described various classes of anti-H. pylori compounds, their structure-activity relationship studies, and mechanism of actions, which could be useful for the development of new drugs for the treatment of H. pylori infections.","['synthetic drug design programs', 'main causal risk factor', 'undesired side effects', 'several antibacterial agents', 'intestinal microbial flora', 'described various classes', 'activity relationship studies', 'new therapeutic agents', 'high dosing leads', 'diverse compounds originating', 'new drugs', 'high selectivity', 'pylori compounds', 'recent years', 'natural sources', 'important way', 'gastroduodenal ulcers', 'gastric diseases', 'gastric carcinoma', 'current interest', 'chronic gastritis', 'pylori strains', 'pylori infections', 'pylori infections', 'pylori infection', 'helicobacter pylori', 'unsuccessful treatment', 'combination therapy', 'unsatisfactory eradication', 'pylori', 'pylori', 'treatment', 'therapy', 'eradication', 'eradication', 'useful', 'used', 'tried', 'thus', 'therefore', 'structure', 'search', 'review', 'resulted', 'resistance', 'preventing', 'optimize', 'one', 'multiple', 'mechanism', 'managing', 'increase', 'however', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'h', 'generation', 'furthermore', 'field', 'evaluated', 'disruption', 'development', 'could', 'applying', 'anti', 'actions']"
"Sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response, caused by pathogenic factors including microorganisms, has high mortality and limited therapeutic approaches.

Studies have showed that incorporation of Se atom into small molecules significantly enhanced their bioactivities. In this paper, according to different applications and structural characteristics, the research progress and therapeutic application of Se-containing compounds are reviewed, and more than 110 Se-containing compounds were selected as representatives which showed potent activities such as anticancer, antioxidant, antifibrolytic, antiparasitic, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal and central nervous system related effects.

"Protein degradation is a promising strategy for drug development. Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) hijacking the E3 ligase cereblon (CRBN) exhibit enormous potential and universal degradation performance due to the small molecular weight of CRBN ligands. In this study, the CRBN-recruiting PROTACs were explored on the degradation of oncogenic fusion protein BCR-ABL, which drives the pathogenesis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). A series of novel PROTACs were synthesized by conjugating BCR-ABL inhibitor dasatinib to the CRBN ligand including pomalidomide and lenalidomide, and the extensive structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies were performed focusing on optimization of linker parameters.

"Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors are currently the first-line drugs approved by the FDA for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, a short effective-window limits their therapeutic benefits. Clinical studies have confirmed that the combination of AChE inhibitors and neuroprotective agents exhibits better anti-AD effects. We have previously reported that the dual AChE/GSK3β (Glycogen synthase kinase 3β) modulators have both neuroprotective effects and cognitive impairment-improvement effects. In this study, we characterized a new backbone of the AChE/GSK3β inhibitor 11c. It was identified as a highly potent AChE inhibitor and was found superior to donepezil, the first-line drug for the treatment of AD. In vivo studies confirmed that 11c significantly inhibited the activity of AChE in the brain but had little effect on the activity of AChE in the intestine. This advantage of 11c was expected to reduce the peripheral side effects caused by donepezil.

The synthesized indole derivatives possess similar properties to natural indole alkaloids. In the last two decades, more and more indole derivatives have been designed and synthesized for searching their bioactivities. This present review describes comprehensive structures of indole compounds with the potential antidiabetic activity including natural indole alkaloids and the synthetic indole derivatives based on the structure classification, summarizes their approaches isolated from natural sources or by synthetic methods, and discusses the antidiabetic effects and the mechanisms of action.

"Interleukin-1β is a central mediator of innate immune responses and inflammation. It plays a key role in a wide variety of pathologies, ranging from autoinflammatory diseases to metabolic syndrome and malignant tumors. It is well established that its inhibition results in a rapid and sustained reduction in disease severity, underlining the importance of having a repertoire of drugs of this class. At present, there are only three interleukin-1β blockers approved in the clinic. All of them are biologics, requiring parenteral administration and resulting in expensive treatments. In an exercise to identify small molecule allosteric inhibitors of MAP kinases, we discovered a series of compounds that block IL-1β release produced as a consequence of a stimulus involved in triggering an inflammatory response.

"The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi is the causative agent of Chagas disease, the most important parasitic infection in Latin America.

To further explore this family of compounds, we synthesised a panel of 69 new analogues, based on multi-parametric structure-activity relationships, which allowed optimization of both anti-parasitic activity, physicochemical parameters and ADME properties. Additionally, we optimized our in vitro screening approaches against all three developmental forms of the parasite, allowing us to discard the least effective and trypanostatic derivatives at an early stage. We ultimately identified derivative 3c, which demonstrated excellent trypanocidal properties, and a synergistic mode of action against trypomastigotes in combination with the reference drug benznidazole.

"Nature represents a rich source of compounds used for the treatment of many diseases. Camptothecin (CPT), isolated from the bark of Camptotheca acuminata, is a cytotoxic alkaloid that attenuates cancer cell replication by inhibiting DNA topoisomerase 1. Despite its promising and wide spectrum antiproliferative activity, its use is limited due to low solubility, instability, acquired tumour cell resistance, and remarkable toxicity. This has led to the development of numerous CPT analogues with improved pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles. Three natural product-inspired drugs, namely, topotecan, irinotecan, and belotecan, are clinically approved and prescribed drugs for the treatment of several types of cancer, whereas other derivatives are in clinical trials. In this review, which covers literature from 2015 to 2020, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview and describe efforts that led to the development of a variety of CPT analogues.

"Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) receptor is an intracellular protein located in late endosomes and lysosomes whose main function is to regulate intracellular cholesterol trafficking. Besides being postulated as necessary for the infection of highly pathogenic viruses in which the integrity of cholesterol transport is required, this protein also allows the entry of the Ebola virus (EBOV) into the host cells acting as an intracellular receptor. EBOV glycoprotein (EBOV-GP) interaction with NPC1 at the endosomal membrane triggers the release of the viral material into the host cell, starting the infective cycle. Disruption of the NPC1/EBOV-GP interaction could represent an attractive strategy for the development of drugs aimed at inhibiting viral entry and thus infection. Some of the today available EBOV inhibitors were proposed to interrupt this interaction, but molecular and structural details about their mode of action are still preliminary thus more efforts are needed to properly address these points. Here, we provide a critical discussion of the potential of NPC1 and its interaction with EBOV-GP as a therapeutic target for viral infections.","['lysosomes whose main function', 'regulate intracellular cholesterol trafficking', 'today available ebov inhibitors', 'gp interaction could represent', 'protein also allows', 'intracellular protein located', 'highly pathogenic viruses', 'endosomal membrane triggers', 'still preliminary thus', 'host cells acting', 'inhibiting viral entry', 'cholesterol transport', 'intracellular receptor', 'host cell', 'viral material', 'viral infections', 'thus infection', 'therapeutic target', 'structural details', 'properly address', 'pick c1', 'late endosomes', 'infective cycle', 'ebola virus', 'drugs aimed', 'critical discussion', 'attractive strategy', 'ebov glycoprotein', 'gp', 'gp', 'entry', 'interaction', 'interaction', 'interaction', 'ebov', 'ebov', 'ebov', 'ebov', 'receptor', 'infection', 'starting', 'required', 'release', 'provide', 'proposed', 'potential', 'postulated', 'points', 'npc1', 'npc1', 'npc1', 'npc1', 'niemann', 'needed', 'necessary', 'molecular', 'mode', 'interrupt', 'integrity', 'efforts', 'disruption', 'development', 'besides', 'action']"
"Natural phenolic compounds found in food have demonstrated interesting preventive and therapeutic effects on a large variety of pathologies. Indeed, some of them, such as resveratrol (RES), have been examined in clinical trials. Nevertheless, their success has been scarce mainly due to their low bioavailability. In this study, we found serendipitously that O-silyl RES derivatives exerted a better neuroprotective activity than resveratrol itself and decided to explore them as potential drugs for neurodegenerative and neurological diseases. We have also designed and prepared a series of O-silyl RES prodrugs to improve their bioavailability. We found that di-triethylsilyl and di-triisopropylsilyl RES derivatives were better in vitro neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory agents than RES. Among these derivatives and their corresponding acyl-, glycosyl- and carbamoyl-prodrugs, 3,5-triethylsilyl-4'-(6″-octanoylglucopyranosyl) resveratrol 26 showed the best profile on toxicity and neuroprotective activity in zebra fish embryo. Compound 26 was also capable of reducing the loss of motor coordination in a 3-nitropropionic acid mice model of Huntington's disease, in a similar way to RES. However, 26 diminished pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 to a higher extent than RES and improved the latency to fall in the rotarod test by 10% with respect to RES. Finally, we investigated 26 and RES as potential treatments on an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) multiple sclerosis mice model.

"Leishmaniasis is a parasitic neglected tropical disease caused by various species of Leishmania parasite. Despite tremendous advancements in the therapeutic sector and drug development strategies, still the existing anti-leishmanial agents are associated with some clinical issues like drug resistance, toxicity and selectivity. Therefore, several research groups are continuously working towards the development of new therapeutic candidates to overcome these issues. Many potential heterocyclic moieties have been explored for this purpose including triazoles, chalcones, chromone, thiazoles, thiosemicarbazones, indole, quinolines, etc. It is evident from the literature that the majority of anti-leishmanial agents act by interacting with key regulators including PTR-I, DHFR, LdMetAP1, MAPK, 14 α-demethylase and pteridine reductase-I, etc. Also, these tend to induce the production of ROS which causes damage to parasites. In the present compilation, authors have summarized various significant synthetic procedures for anti-leishmanial agents reported in recent years. A brief description of the pharmacological potentials of synthesized compounds along with important aspects related to structural activity relationship has been provided.

In other words, carbohydrates are a relatively untapped source of new drugs and therefore may offer exciting novel therapeutic opportunities.

"Memory and cognitive functions depend on the cerebral levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which are regulated by the phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) family of enzymes. Selected rolipram-related PDE4 inhibitors, members of the GEBR library, have been shown to increase hippocampal cAMP levels, providing pro-cognitive benefits with a safe pharmacological profile. In a recent SAR investigation involving a subset of GEBR library compounds, we have demonstrated that, depending on length and flexibility, ligands can either adopt a twisted, an extended or a protruding conformation, the latter allowing the ligand to form stabilizing contacts with the regulatory domain of the enzyme. Here, based on those findings, we describe further chemical modifications of the protruding subset of GEBR library inhibitors and their effects on ligand conformation and potency. In particular, we demonstrate that the insertion of a methyl group in the flexible linker region connecting the catechol portion and the basic end of the molecules enhances the ability of the ligand to interact with both the catalytic and the regulatory domains of the enzyme.","['recent sar investigation involving', 'flexible linker region connecting', 'increase hippocampal camp levels', 'safe pharmacological profile', 'form stabilizing contacts', 'cyclic adenosine monophosphate', 'cognitive functions depend', 'gebr library inhibitors', 'gebr library compounds', 'related pde4 inhibitors', 'gebr library', 'cerebral levels', 'camp ),', 'cognitive benefits', 'selected rolipram', 'regulatory domains', 'regulatory domain', 'providing pro', 'protruding conformation', 'phosphodiesterase 4', 'molecules enhances', 'methyl group', 'latter allowing', 'either adopt', 'chemical modifications', 'catechol portion', 'basic end', 'protruding subset', 'ligand conformation', 'pde4', 'subset', 'ligand', 'ligand', 'twisted', 'shown', 'regulated', 'potency', 'particular', 'memory', 'members', 'ligands', 'length', 'interact', 'insertion', 'flexibility', 'findings', 'family', 'extended', 'enzymes', 'enzyme', 'enzyme', 'effects', 'describe', 'depending', 'demonstrated', 'demonstrate', 'catalytic', 'based', 'ability']"

These data may indicate that compound 19m has a good drug safety. Partial ADME properties were evaluated in vitro and in vivo.

"Si113, a pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivative, gained more attention as an anticancer agent due to its potent anticancer activity on both in vitro and in vivo hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) and ovarian carcinoma models. But the drawback is the low water solubility which prevents its further development. In this context, we successfully overcame this limitation by synthesizing two novel prodrugs introducing the amino acid sequence D-Ala-Leu-Lys (TP). Moreover, TP sequence has a high affinity with plasmin, a protease recognized as overexpressed in many solid cancers, including HCC and ovarian carcinoma. The prodrugs were synthesized and fully characterized in terms of in vitro ADME properties, plasma stability and plasmin-induced release of the parent drug. The inhibitory activity against Sgk1 was evaluated and in vitro growth inhibition was evaluated on ovarian carcinoma and HCC cell lines in the presence and absence of human plasmin. In vivo pharmacokinetic properties and preliminary tissue distribution confirmed a better profile highlighting the importance of the prodrug approach. Finally, the prodrug antitumor efficacy was evaluated in an HCC xenografted murine model, where a significant reduction (around 90%) in tumor growth was observed.

"Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) are collectively known as gelatinases whereas MMP-2 is gelatinase-A and MMP-9 is termed as gelatinase-B. Gelatinases and other matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have long been associated with solid tumor invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. However, there is paucity of data available regarding the role of gelatinases in hematological malignancies. Recent studies have shown that gelatinases activities or functions are correlated with hematological malignancies. Strategies for designing more specific gelatinase inhibitors like catalytic (CAT) domain inhibitors and hemopexin (PEX) domain inhibitors as well as signaling pathway based or gelatinase expression inhibitors had been reported against hematologic malignant cells. Several substrate based non-selective to non-substrate based relatively selective synthetic matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors (MMPIs) had been developed. Few MMPIs had reached in clinical trials during the period of 1990s-2000s. Unfortunately the anti-tumor and anti-metastatic efficacies of these MMPIs were not justified with patients having several advanced stage solid tumor cancers in any substantial number of clinical trials. Till date not a single MMPI passed phase III clinical trials designed for advanced metastatic cancers due to adverse events as well as lack of ability to show uniformity in disease prolongation. With the best of our knowledge no clinical trial study has been reported with small molecule synthetic inhibitors against hematological malignancies.

"The genome packaging of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) requires a divalent metal-dependent endonuclease activity localized to the C-terminus of pUL89 (pUL89-C), which is reminiscent of RNase H-like enzymes in active site structure and catalytic mechanism. Our previous work has shown that metal-binding small molecules can effectively inhibit pUL89-C while conferring significant antiviral activities. In this report we generated a collection of 43 metal-binding small molecules by repurposing analogs of the 6-arylthio-3-hydroxypyrimidine-2,4-dione chemotype previously synthesized for targeting HIV-1 RNase H, and by chemically synthesizing new N-1 analogs. The analogs were subjected to two parallel screening assays: the pUL89-C biochemical assay and the HCMV antiviral assay. Compounds with significant inhibition from each assay were further tested in a dose-response fashion. Single dose cell viability and PAMPA cell permeability were also conducted and considered in selecting compounds for the dose-response antiviral testing. These assays identified a few analogs displaying low μM inhibition against pUL89-C in the biochemical assay and HCMV replication in the antiviral assay. The target engagement was further evaluated via a thermal shift assay using recombinant pUL89-C and molecular docking.

"Lectins are a family of glycan-binding proteins, many of which have been established as key targets for therapeutic intervention. They play a central role in many physiological and cellular processes. With the advances in protein crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and computational power over the past couple of decades, the carbohydrate-receptor interactions are now well understood and characterized. Nevertheless, designing efficient carbohydrate inhibitors is a laborious endeavour. They are known to have weak affinities, unsuitable pharmacokinetic properties and highly cumbersome/complex synthetic routes. To circumvent these issues many non-carbohydrate strategies have been reported. Galectins are a sub-family of lectin proteins which have been recognized as crucial targets for a wide variety of diseases. Many candidates targeting galectins are currently in advanced stages of clinical trials. There have been a few reports of non-carbohydrate inhibitors targeting galectins which comprise of peptide-based inhibitors and a recent flourish of heterocyclic inhibitors.

In addition, molecular electrostatic potential surfaces were developed to explain the high antibacterial activity of the target compounds.

"Clinical reports have highlighted the radical increase of antibiotic resistance. As a result, multidrug resistance has emerged as a serious threat to human health. Many organic compounds commonly used as drugs in the past, no longer have pure organic mode of action rather need bio-transformation or more activation. Bulk of research has shown that they need trace amount of metal ions incorporated within the chemistry of bioactive molecules for enhancement of their potentiality to fight aggressively against resistance. The deficiency of some metal ions can also be responsible for many diseases like growth retardation, pernicious anemia and heart diseases in infants. To overcome these problems, there is a need to introduce novel strategies which have new mechanism of action along with significant spectrum of biological activity, enhanced safety and efficacy. Bioinorganic compounds have played imperative role in developing the new strategy in the form of ""Metal Based Drugs"". In current years there have been momentous rise of interest in the application of metal based Schiff base compounds to treat various diseases which are difficult to be treated with conventional methodologies.

"Microtubules (MTs) are the principal target for drugs acting against mitosis. These compounds, called microtubule targeting agents (MTAs), cause a mitotic arrest during G2/M phase, subsequently inducing cell apoptosis. MTAs could be classified in two groups: microtubule stabilising agents (MSAs) and microtubule destabilising agents (MDAs). In this paper we present a new series of (E) (Z)-2-(5,6-difluoro-(1H)2H-benzo[d] [1,2,3]triazol-1(2)-yl)-3-(R)acrylonitrile (9a-j, 10e, 11a,b) and (E)-2-(1H-benzo[d] [1,2,3]triazol-1-yl)-3-(R)acrylonitrile derivatives (13d,j), which were recognised to act as MTAs agents. They were rationally designed, synthesised, characterised and subjected to different biological assessments. Computational docking was carried out in order to investigate the potential binding to the colchicine-binding site on tubulin. From this first prediction, the di-fluoro substitution seemed to be beneficial for the binding affinity with tubulin. The new fluorine derivatives, here presented, showed an improved antiproliferative activity when compared to the previously reported compounds. The biological evaluation included a preliminary antiproliferative screening on NCI60 cancer cells panel (1-10 μM). Compound 9a was selected as lead compound of the new series of derivatives. The in vitro XTT assay, flow cytometry analysis and immunostaining performed on HeLa cells treated with 9a showed a considerable antiproliferative effect, (IC50 = 3.2 μM), an increased number of cells in G2/M-phase, followed by an enhancement in cell division defects. Moreover, β-tubulin staining confirmed 9a as a MDA triggering tubulin disassembly, whereas colchicine-9a competition assay suggested that compound 9a compete with colchicine for the binding site on tubulin. Then, the co-administration of compound 9a and an extrusion pump inhibitor (EPI) was investigated: the association resulted beneficial for the antiproliferative activity and compound 9a showed to be client of extrusion pumps. Finally, structural superimposition of different colchicine binding site inhibitors (CBIs) in clinical trial and our MDA, provided an additional confirmation of the targeting to the predicted binding site.

"HPLW is a Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)-mimicking beta-hairpin peptide endowed of proangiogenic effect and showing valuable biomedical application in the proangiogenic therapy. However, the translational potential of HPLW is limited by its low metabolic stability, which would shorten the in vivo efficacy of the molecule. Here, we developed a peptide analog of HPLW, named HPLW2, that retains the structural and biological properties of the original peptide but features an impressive resistance to degradation by human serum proteases. HPLW2 was obtained by covalently modifying the chemical structure of the peptide with molecular tools known to impart protease resistance. Notably, the peptide was cyclized by installing an interstrand triazole bridge through Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction. HPLW2 appears as a novel and promising drug candidate with potential biomedical application in the proangiogenic therapy as a low molecular weight drug, alternative to the use of VEGF. Our work points out the utility of the interstrand triazole bridge as effective chemical platform for the conformational and metabolic stabilization of beta-hairpin bioactive peptides.","['vascular endothelial growth factor', 'showing valuable biomedical application', 'low molecular weight drug', 'vegf )- mimicking beta', 'promising drug candidate', 'potential biomedical application', 'molecular tools known', ')- catalyzed azide', 'low metabolic stability', 'interstrand triazole bridge', 'interstrand triazole bridge', 'human serum proteases', 'hairpin bioactive peptides', 'impart protease resistance', 'effective chemical platform', 'hairpin peptide endowed', 'translational potential', 'metabolic stabilization', 'impressive resistance', 'chemical structure', 'would shorten', 'work points', 'vivo efficacy', 'proangiogenic therapy', 'proangiogenic therapy', 'proangiogenic effect', 'dipolar cycloaddition', 'covalently modifying', 'biological properties', 'alkyne 1', 'peptide analog', 'original peptide', 'named hplw2', 'hplw2 appears', 'vegf', 'beta', 'peptide', 'peptide', 'hplw2', 'utility', 'use', 'structural', 'retains', 'reaction', 'obtained', 'novel', 'notably', 'molecule', 'limited', 'installing', 'hplw', 'hplw', 'hplw', 'however', 'features', 'developed', 'degradation', 'cyclized', 'cuaac', 'cu', 'conformational', 'alternative', '3']"

"Development of a simple method to enhance targeting and anti-tumor effect of the chemotherapeutic agents in vivo is a major problem. Amphipathic and natural daptomycin is biocompatible antibacterial polypeptide used in clinical practice. Herein, doxorubicin (DOX) was stabilized by zwitterionic daptomycin (Dap) micelles in aqueous solution to form a zwitterionic nanodrug (Dap-DOX micelles). The hydrodynamic size and zeta potential of Dap-DOX micelles were 85 nm and -10 mV, respectively. The study on the controlled release showed that more DOX molecules were released from Dap-DOX micelles at acidic condition of tumor tissue than that at neutral condition of normal tissue which was due to pH responsiveness of Dap-DOX micelles. Dap-DOX micelles exhibited good stability in fibrinogen solution. Moreover, MTT studies showed that Dap-DOX micelles had higher cytotoxicity than free DOX. Notably, the results of flow cytometry indicated that the average fluorescence intensity of Dap-DOX micelle-treated cells was higher than that of free DOX-treated cells, and acidic conditions were more favorable for Dap-DOX micelles than normal pH in cell uptake assay. More importantly, Dap-DOX micelles were biocompatible in vivo based on the changes of weight and blood indexes of mice. Dap-DOX micelles were selectively accumulated at tumor sites in vivo through EPR effect, which reduced the toxicity of free DOX and achieved excellent tumor inhibition effect. The tumor inhibition rate of Dap-DOX micelles reached 96%. Dap-DOX micelles also effectively inhibited the growth of bacterial. Taken together, Dap-based drug delivery systems are promising and effective in cancer therapy.","['dox micelles reached 96 %.', 'dox micelles exhibited good stability', 'dox micelles also effectively inhibited', 'achieved excellent tumor inhibition effect', 'based drug delivery systems', 'biocompatible antibacterial polypeptide used', 'tumor inhibition rate', 'mtt studies showed', 'flow cytometry indicated', 'controlled release showed', 'cell uptake assay', 'average fluorescence intensity', 'dox micelles ).', 'tumor effect', 'dox micelles', 'dox micelles', 'dox micelles', 'dox micelles', 'dox micelles', 'dox micelles', 'dox micelles', 'epr effect', 'tumor tissue', 'tumor sites', 'free dox', 'free dox', 'free dox', 'dox molecules', 'dox micelle', 'vivo based', 'zwitterionic nanodrug', 'zwitterionic daptomycin', 'zeta potential', 'treated cells', 'treated cells', 'taken together', 'simple method', 'selectively accumulated', 'ph responsiveness', 'normal tissue', 'normal ph', 'neutral condition', 'natural daptomycin', 'major problem', 'hydrodynamic size', 'fibrinogen solution', 'enhance targeting', 'clinical practice', 'chemotherapeutic agents', 'cancer therapy', 'blood indexes', 'aqueous solution', 'acidic conditions', 'acidic condition', '85 nm', '10 mv', 'higher cytotoxicity', 'micelles', 'dox', 'biocompatible', 'higher', 'vivo', 'vivo', 'weight', 'toxicity', 'study', 'stabilized', 'results', 'respectively', 'released', 'reduced', 'promising', 'notably', 'moreover', 'mice', 'importantly', 'herein', 'growth', 'form', 'favorable', 'effective', 'due', 'doxorubicin', 'development', 'dap', 'dap', 'dap', 'dap', 'dap', 'dap', 'dap', 'dap', 'dap', 'dap', 'dap', 'dap', 'dap', 'dap', 'changes', 'bacterial', 'anti', 'amphipathic']"

"The catalytic properties of small-molecule proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) may lead to uncontrolled degradation. Therefore, the main disadvantages of PROTACs are non-cancer specificity and relatively high toxicity, which limit the clinical application of PROTACs.

"Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is a valuable drug target for diabetic treatment and ligands of PPARγ have shown potent anti-diabetic efficacy. However, to overcome the severe side effects of current PPARγ-targeted drugs, novel PPARγ ligands need to be developed. Sulindac, an identified ligand of PPARγ, is widely used in clinic as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. To explore its potential application for diabetes, we designed and synthesized a series of sulindac derivatives to investigate their structure-activity relationship as PPARγ ligand and potential anti-diabetic effect. We found that meta-substitution in sulindac's benzylidene moiety was beneficial to PPARγ binding and transactivation.

This scenario exaggerated the need for the discovery of novel targets and their inhibitors. Targeting the ""Mtb cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis"" is an attractive strategy to overcome drug resistance. Mur enzymes (MurA-MurF) play essential roles in the peptidoglycan synthesis by catalyzing the ligation of key amino acid residues to the stem peptide. These enzymes are unique and confined to the eubacteria and are absent in humans, representing potential targets for anti-tubercular drug discovery. Mtb Mur ligases with the same catalytic mechanism share conserved amino acid regions and structural features that can conceivably exploit for the designing of the inhibitors, which can simultaneously target more than one isoforms (MurC-MurF) of the enzyme.

"β-Amyloid (Aβ) triggered proteopathic and immunopathic processes are a postulated cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Monomeric Aβ is derived from amyloid precursor protein, whereupon it aggregates into various assemblies, including oligomers and fibrils, which disrupt neuronal membrane integrity and induce cellular damage. Aβ is directly neurotoxic/synaptotoxic, but may also induce neuroinflammation through the concomitant activation of microglia. Previously, we have shown that furosemide is a known anthranilate-based drug with the capacity to downregulate the proinflammatory microglial M1 phenotype and upregulate the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. To further explore the pharmacologic effects of furosemide, this study reports a series of furosemide analogs that target both Aβ aggregation and neuroinflammation, thereby addressing the combined proteopathic-immunopathic pathogenesis of AD. Forty compounds were synthesized and evaluated. Compounds 3c, 3g, and 20 inhibited Aβ oligomerization; 33 and 34 inhibited Aβ fibrillization. 3g and 34 inhibited the production of TNF-α, IL-6, and nitric oxide, downregulated the expression of COX-2 and iNOS, and promoted microglial phagocytotic activity, suggesting dual activity against Aβ aggregation and neuroinflammation.

"The aim of this study was to synthesize chalcone-polyamine conjugates in order to enhance bioavailability and selectivity of chalcone core towards cancer cells, using polyamine-based vectors. Indeed, it is well-known that polyamine transport system is upregulated in tumor cells. 3',4,4',5'-tetramethoxychalcone was selected as parent chalcone since it was found to be an efficient anti-proliferative agent on various cancer cells. A series of five chalcone-polyamine conjugates was obtained using the 4-bromopropyloxy-3',4',5'-trimethoxychalcone as a key intermediate. Chalcone core and polyamine tails were fused through an amine bond. These conjugates were found to possess a marked in vitro antiproliferative effect against colorectal (HT-29 and HCT-116) and prostate cancer (PC-3 and DU-145) cell lines. The most active conjugate (compound 8b) was then chosen for further biological evaluations to elucidate mechanisms responsible for its antiproliferative activity. Investigations on cell cycle distribution revealed that this conjugate can prevent the proliferation of human colorectal and prostate cancer cells by blocking the cell cycle at the G1 and G2 phase, respectively. Flow cytometry analysis revealed a sub-G1 peak, characteristic of apoptotic cell population and our inquiries highlighted apoptosis induction at early and later stages through several pro-apoptotic markers.

"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a cancer subtype critically dependent upon excessive activation of Wnt pathway. The anti-mycobacterial drug clofazimine is an efficient inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling in TNBC, reducing tumor cell proliferation in vitro and in animal models. These properties make clofazimine a candidate to become first targeted therapy against TNBC. In this work, we optimized the clofazimine structure to enhance its water solubility and potency as a Wnt inhibitor. After extensive structure-activity relationships investigations, the riminophenazine 5-(4-(chlorophenyl)-3-((2-(piperazin-1-yl)ethyl)imino)-N-(pyridin-3-yl)-3,5-dihydrophenazin-2-amine (MU17) was identified as the new lead compound for the riminophenazine-based targeted therapy against TNBC and Wnt-dependent cancers. Compared to clofazimine, the water-soluble MU17 displayed a 7-fold improved potency against Wnt signaling in TNBC cells resulting in on-target suppression of tumor growth in a patient-derived mouse model of TNBC. Moreover, allowing the administration of reduced yet effective dosages, MU17 displayed no adverse effects, most notably no clofazimine-related skin coloration.","['riminophenazine 5 -( 4 -( chlorophenyl )- 3 -(( 2 -( piperazin', 'cancer subtype critically dependent upon excessive activation', 'imino )- n -( pyridin', 'reduced yet effective dosages', 'reducing tumor cell proliferation', 'become first targeted therapy', 'yl )- 3', 'negative breast cancer', 'based targeted therapy', 'related skin coloration', 'new lead compound', 'derived mouse model', 'activity relationships investigations', 'properties make clofazimine', 'mycobacterial drug clofazimine', 'fold improved potency', 'soluble mu17 displayed', 'canonical wnt signaling', 'tnbc cells resulting', 'riminophenazine', 'dependent cancers', '5', '2', '3', 'tumor growth', 'wnt signaling', 'mu17 displayed', 'wnt pathway', 'wnt inhibitor', 'target suppression', 'extensive structure', 'efficient inhibitor', 'clofazimine structure', 'animal models', 'adverse effects', 'water solubility', 'yl', 'wnt', 'potency', 'mu17', 'clofazimine', 'clofazimine', 'water', 'tnbc', 'tnbc', 'tnbc', 'tnbc', 'tnbc', 'work', 'vitro', 'triple', 'patient', 'optimized', 'notably', 'moreover', 'identified', 'ethyl', 'enhance', 'dihydrophenazin', 'compared', 'candidate', 'anti', 'amine', 'allowing', 'administration', '7', '1']"

"Abnormal epigenetics is a critical hallmark of human cancers. Anticancer drug discovery directed at histone epigenetic modulators has gained impressive advances with six drugs available for cancer therapy and numerous other candidates undergoing clinical trials. However, limited therapeutic profile, drug resistance, narrow safety margin, and dose-limiting toxicities pose intractable challenges for their clinical utility. Because histone epigenetic modulators undergo intricate crosstalk and act cooperatively to shape an aberrant epigenetic profile, co-targeting histone epigenetic modulators with a different mechanism of action has rapidly emerged as an attractive strategy to overcome the limitations faced by the single-target epigenetic inhibitors.

"An unprecedented amount of fungal and fungal-like infections has recently brought about some of the most severe die-offs and extinctions due to fungal drug resistance.

Some prepared purinylthiazolylethanone derivatives possessed satisfactory inhibitory action towards the tested fungi, among which compound 8c gave a MIC value of 1 μg/mL against C. albicans. The active molecule 8c was able to kill C. albicans with undetectable resistance as well as low hematotoxicity and cytotoxicity. Furthermore, it could hinder the growth of C. albicans biofilm, thus avoiding the occurrence of drug resistance. Mechanism research manifested that purinylthiazolylethanone derivative 8c led to damage of cell wall and membrane disruption, so protein leakage and the cytoplasmic membrane depolarization were observed. On this account, the activity of fungal lactate dehydrogenase was reduced and metabolism was impeded.

"The anthraquinone scaffold has long been known as a source of efficacious antitumor drugs. In particular, the various chemical modifications of the side chains in this scaffold have yielded the compounds potent for the wild type tumor cells, their counterparts with molecular determinants of altered drug response, as well as in vivo settings. Further exploring the chemotype of anticancer heteroarene-fused anthraquinones, we herein demonstrate that derivative of anthra[2,3-b]thiophene-2-carboxamide, (compound 8) is highly potent against a panel of human tumor cell lines and their drug resistant variants. Treatment with submicromolar or low micromolar concentrations of 8 for only 30 min was sufficient to trigger lethal damage of K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. Compound 8 (2.5 μM, 3-6 h) induced an apoptotic cell death as determined by concomitant activation of caspases 3 and 9, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, increase of Annexin V/propidium iodide double stained cells, DNA fragmentation (subG1 fraction) and a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential. Neither a significant interaction with double stranded DNA nor strong inhibition of the DNA dependent enzyme topoisomerase 1 by 8 were detectable in cell free systems. Laser scanning confocal microscopy revealed that some amount of 8 was detectable in mitochondria as early as 5 min after the addition to the cells; exposure for 1 h caused significant morphological changes and clustering of mitochondria. The bioisosteric analog 2 in which the thiophene ring was replaced with furan was less active although the patterns of cytotoxicity of both derivatives were similar.

"Malaria, even though an avoidable and treatable disease, can be fatal if ignored. Artemisinin Combination Therapy (ACT) and RTS, S/AS01 vaccine (Mosquirix™) are the only modest means available with humans to overcome malaria, a lethal affliction wreaking havoc across the globe. Employment of ACT is associated with problems such as 'Artemisinin Resistance' and the 'Hypnozoite conundrum' that hinder the complete eradication of malaria. In this view, the natural products specifically comprising β-carboline scaffold have shown good antiplasmodial responses against different strains of malaria. Taking these observations forward, researchers have performed structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies around three different β-carboline skeletons (tetrahydro β-carbolines, dihydro β-carbolines, β-carbolines) to design new β-carboline derived heterocyclic structures or modified naturally occurring derivatives. In addition, different approaches such as dimerization and linkage to other moieties have also been adopted to enhance the antimalarial activity. The present review describes a comprehensive SAR study encapsulating various natural and synthetic β-carbolines to elaborate upon the utility of these skeletons in designing drugs to subdue this deadly disease.","['comprehensive sar study encapsulating various natural', 'lethal affliction wreaking havoc across', 'natural products specifically comprising β', 'studies around three different β', 'shown good antiplasmodial responses', 'modified naturally occurring derivatives', 'carboline derived heterocyclic structures', 'present review describes', 'modest means available', 'design new β', 'artemisinin combination therapy', 'different strains', 'different approaches', 'tetrahydro β', 'synthetic β', 'dihydro β', 'carboline scaffold', 'artemisinin resistance', 'carboline skeletons', 'treatable disease', 'performed structure', 'observations forward', 'mosquirix ™)', 'hypnozoite conundrum', 'even though', 'elaborate upon', 'designing drugs', 'deadly disease', 'complete eradication', 'as01 vaccine', 'antimalarial activity', 'activity relationship', 'sar', 'overcome malaria', 'β', 'skeletons', 'malaria', 'malaria', 'malaria', 'view', 'utility', 'taking', 'subdue', 'rts', 'researchers', 'problems', 'moieties', 'linkage', 'ignored', 'humans', 'hinder', 'globe', 'fatal', 'enhance', 'employment', 'dimerization', 'carbolines', 'carbolines', 'carbolines', 'carbolines', 'avoidable', 'associated', 'also', 'adopted', 'addition', 'act', 'act']"

"Long-term survivors of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) are at high risk of developing second primary neoplasms, including leukemia. For these patients, the use of classic tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as imatinib mesylate, is strongly discouraged, since this treatment causes a tremendous increase of tumor and stem cell migration and invasion. We aimed to develop agents useful for the treatment of patients with GBM and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) using an alternative mechanism of action from the TKIs, specifically based on the inhibition of tubulin polymerization. Compounds 7 and 25, as planned, not only inhibited tubulin polymerization, but also inhibited the proliferation of both GMB and CML cells, including those expressing the T315I mutation, at nanomolar concentrations. In in vivo experiments in BALB/cnu/nu mice injected subcutaneously with U87MG cells, in vivo, 7 significantly inhibited GBM cancer cell proliferation, in vivo tumorigenesis, and tumor growth, tumorigenesis and angiogenesis.

In this light, a special focus is given to the quinoline compounds, acting with classical/well-known mechanisms of action (DNA intercalators or Topoisomerase inhibitors). In particular, the quinoline drugs amsacrine and camptothecin (CPT) have been studied as key lead compounds for the development of new agents with improved PK and tolerability properties. Moreover, notable attention has been paid to the quinoline molecules, which are able to interfere with emerging targets involved in cancer progression, as G-quadruplexes or the epigenetic ones (e.g.: histone deacetylase, DNA and histones methyltransferase). The antiproliferative and the enzymatic inhibition data of the reviewed compounds have been analyzed.

"The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), acting at the serotonin transporter (SERT), are one of the most widely prescribed antidepressant medications. All five approved SSRIs possess either fluorine or chlorine atoms, and there is a limited number of reports describing their analogs with heavier halogens, i.e., bromine and iodine. To elucidate the role of halogen atoms in the binding of SSRIs to SERT, we designed a series of 22 fluoxetine and fluvoxamine analogs substituted with fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine atoms, differently arranged on the phenyl ring. The obtained biological activity data, supported by a thorough in silico binding mode analysis, allowed the identification of two partners for halogen bond interactions: the backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms of E493 and T497.

"Herein we investigated the structural and cellular effects ensuing from the cyclization of a potent inhibitor of JAK2 as mimetic of SOCS1 protein, named PS5. The introduction of un-natural residues and a lactam internal bridge, within SOCS1-KIR motif, produced candidates that showed high affinity toward JAK2 catalytic domain. By combining CD, NMR and computational studies, we obtained valuable models of the interactions of two peptidomimetics of SOCS1 to deepen their functional behaviors. Notably, when assayed for their biological cell responses mimicking SOCS1 activity, the internal cyclic PS5 analogues demonstrated able to inhibit JAK-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and to reduce cytokine-induced proinflammatory gene expression, oxidative stress generation and cell migration.

"Natural peptides extracted from natural components such are known to have a relatively short in-vivo half-life and can readily metabolize by endo- and exo-peptidases. Fortunately, synthetic peptides can be easily manipulated to increase in-vivo stability, membrane permeability and target specificity with some well-known natural families. Many natural as well as synthetic peptides target to their endogenous receptors for diagnosis and therapeutic applications. In order to detect these peptides externally, they must be modified with radionuclides compatible with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET). Although, these techniques mainly rely on physiological changes and have profound diagnostic strength over anatomical modalities such as MRI and CT. However, both SPECT and PET observed to possess lack of anatomical reference frame which is a key weakness of these techniques, and unfortunately, cannot be available freely in most clinical centres especially in under-developing countries. Hence, it is need of the time to design and develop economic, patient friendly and versatile strategies to grapple with existing problems without any hazardous side effects.

"Endocrine therapy (ET) has benefited patients with estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) positive breast cancer for decades. Selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) such as Tamoxifen represents the clinical standard of care (SoC). Despite the therapeutic importance of current SoC agents, 30-50% of prolonged treatment patients inevitably generated resistant tumor cells, usually eventually suffered tumor relapse and developed into metastatic breast cancer (MBC), which was the leading cause of female cancer-related mortality. Among these, most resistant tumors remained dependent on ERα signaling, which reignited the need for the next generation of ERα related agents. We hypothesized that selective estrogen receptor covalent antagonists targeting ERα would provide a therapeutic alternative. In the current work, series of novel benzothiophene hybrids bearing electrophile moieties were synthesized and biologically evaluated. The representative analogue 15c exhibited potent anti-proliferative effect in MCF-7 cell lines in vitro, and further mechanism studies confirmed the necessity of covalent bonding.

Importantly, the absence of the hydroxyl group at C3 prevents binding to estrogen receptors, which might concur to the antitumor activity observed for compound 1, leading to a specific FGF/FGFR system inhibitor, and further supporting the role of FGFR in anticancer therapy in MM.","['studies unveiled compound 25b', 'steroidal derivative nsc12', 'keto 20r derivative', 'including multiple myeloma', 'dependent receptor activation', 'c3 prevents binding', 'slowing mm growth', 'fgfr system inhibitor', 'fgf trap endowed', 'antitumor activity observed', 'antitumor activity', 'malignances dependent', 'c3 position', 'activity relationships', 'compound 1', 'compound 1', 'compound 1', 'compound 1', 'specific fgf', 'propanediol chain', 'promising strategy', 'mm cells', 'mm ).', 'might concur', 'investigate structure', 'inhibiting fgf', 'hydroxyl group', 'fgfr signaling', 'fgf stimulation', 'estrogen receptors', 'effective agent', 'chemical modifications', 'anticancer therapy', 'pregnane 3', 'mm', 'fgfr', 'fgf', '1', '3', 'vivo', 'vivo', 'vitro', 'trifluoromethyl', 'treatment', 'supporting', 'stereochemistry', 'role', 'role', 'proliferation', 'pan', 'leading', 'inhibition', 'importantly', 'functionalization', 'focusing', 'explored', 'c20', 'blocking', 'bis', 'absence']"
"A series of novel α-l-threose nucleoside phosphonate analogs, 4(R)-methyl-3-O-phosphonomethyl-α-l-threose nucleosides, were synthesized in multistep sequences starting from d-xylose. The synthetic sequence consisted of the following key stages: (i) the multistep synthesis of 1,2-O-isopropylidenyl-4(R)-methyl-3-O-phosphonomethyl-l-threose, (ii) the transformation of 1,2-O-isopropylidenyl sugar into suitable 1,2-di-O-acyl l-threose precursor, and (iii) the construction of target α-l-threose nucleoside phosphonate analogs by Vorbrüggen glycosidation reaction, deprotection of acyl group, and hydrolysis of diethyl group on phosphonate. The target nucleoside phosphonates were evaluated for their antitumour activities in cell culture-based assays.

"Breast cancer is the second most leading cause of death among women. Multiple drugs have been approved by FDA for the treatment of BC. The major drawbacks of existing drugs are the development of resistance, toxicity, selectivity problem. The other therapies like hormonal therapy, surgery, radiotherapy, and immune therapy are in use but showed many side effects like bioavailability issues, non-selectivity, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic problems. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new moieties that are nonviolent and more effective in the treatment of cancer. Isoxazole derivatives have gain popularity in recent years due to anticancer potential with the least side effects. These derivatives act as an anticancer agent with different mechanisms like inducing apoptosis, aromatase inhibition, disturbing tubulin congregation, topoisomerase inhibition, HDAC inhibition, and ERα inhibition. In this article, we have explored the synthetic strategies, anticancer mechanism of action along with SAR studies of isoxazole derivatives.","['showed many side effects like bioavailability issues', 'different mechanisms like inducing apoptosis', 'therapies like hormonal therapy', 'least side effects', 'recent years due', 'disturbing tubulin congregation', 'develop new moieties', 'death among women', 'immune therapy', 'urgent need', 'topoisomerase inhibition', 'synthetic strategies', 'sar studies', 'pharmacodynamic problems', 'multiple drugs', 'major drawbacks', 'leading cause', 'isoxazole derivatives', 'isoxazole derivatives', 'hdac inhibition', 'gain popularity', 'existing drugs', 'erα inhibition', 'derivatives act', 'aromatase inhibition', 'anticancer potential', 'anticancer mechanism', 'anticancer agent', 'action along', 'selectivity problem', 'breast cancer', 'selectivity', 'cancer', 'use', 'treatment', 'treatment', 'toxicity', 'therefore', 'surgery', 'second', 'resistance', 'radiotherapy', 'pharmacokinetic', 'nonviolent', 'non', 'fda', 'explored', 'effective', 'development', 'bc', 'article', 'approved']"
"STAT3 has been validated as an attractive anticancer target due to its important roles in cancer initiation and progression. However, discovery of potent and selective STAT3 small-molecule inhibitors with druglike properties is still challenging. In this study, two series of substituted 2-phenylquinolines and 2-arylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridines were designed through structure-based drug discovery approach by condensing the privileged structures of STX-119 and SH4-54. Our study has resulted in the discovery of a number of highly potent and selective STAT3 inhibitors, exemplified by compound 39 with the privileged structure of 2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine, which selectively inhibits phosphorylation of STAT3 and suppresses subsequent signaling pathway. Moreover, 39 inhibits cell growth, migration and invasion of human triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells lines. Consistently, it achieves significant and dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition in both cell line-derived and patient-derived xenograft tumor models in mice. These results clearly indicate that 39 is a highly potent and selective STAT3 inhibitor.","['human triple negative breast cancer', 'suppresses subsequent signaling pathway', 'dependent tumor growth inhibition', 'attractive anticancer target due', 'derived xenograft tumor models', 'based drug discovery approach', '39 inhibits cell growth', 'selectively inhibits phosphorylation', 'results clearly indicate', 'selective stat3 small', 'selective stat3 inhibitor', 'selective stat3 inhibitors', 'cancer initiation', 'cell line', 'molecule inhibitors', 'compound 39', 'two series', 'still challenging', 'privileged structures', 'important roles', 'druglike properties', 'cells lines', 'achieves significant', 'highly potent', 'highly potent', 'privileged structure', 'substituted 2', 'derived', '39', 'stat3', 'stat3', 'discovery', 'discovery', 'potent', 'structure', '2', '2', '2', '2', 'validated', 'tnbc', 'stx', 'study', 'study', 'sh4', 'resulted', 'pyridines', 'pyridine', 'progression', 'phenylquinolines', 'phenylimidazo', 'patient', 'number', 'moreover', 'migration', 'mice', 'invasion', 'however', 'exemplified', 'dose', 'designed', 'consistently', 'condensing', 'arylimidazo', '54', '119', '1', '1']"
"Despite significant improvements of new treatment options, cancer continues to represent as one of the most common and fatal disease. The EGFR signaling pathway is considered as a significant approach in targeted therapy of cancers. Blocking the EGFR-driven pathway by inhibiting the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR have shown considerable improvement in cancer therapy. In an effort to identify EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), several small molecules especially pyrimidine containing derivatives have been designed by applying molecular simulation and evaluated the emergence of epigenetic mutation and resistance problems restricted the long-term effectiveness of such medication and explained the need for further investigations in this field. In recent years, the studies have been focused on genetic alterations on EGFR tyrosine kinase domain, which led to the design and synthesis of more selective and effective inhibitors. Herein, we give an overview of the importance and status of EGFR inhibitors in cancer therapy.

"Natural products and synthetic analogs have drawn much attention as potential therapeutical drugs to treat metabolic syndrome. We reviewed the underlying mechanisms of 32 natural products and analogs with potential pharmacological effects in vitro, and especially in rodent models and/or patients, that usually act on the PPAR pathway, along with other molecular targets. Recent outstanding total syntheses or semisyntheses of these lead compounds are stated. In general, they can activate the transcriptional activity of PPARα, PPARγ, PPARα/γ, PPARβ/δ, PPARα/δ, PPARγ/δ and panPPAR as weak, partial agonists or selective PPARγ modulators (SPPARγM), which may be useful for managing obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), dyslipidemia and non-fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Terpenoids is the largest group of compounds that act as potential modulators on PPARs and are comprised from small lipophilic cannabinoids to lipophilic pentacyclic triterpenes and polar saponins. Shikimates-phenylpropanoids include polar heterocyclic flavonoids and phenolic compounds containing at least one C3-C6 unit and usually a double bond on the propyl chain. Quercetin (19), resveratrol (24) and curcumin (27), stand out from this group for exhibiting beneficial effects on patients. Alkaloids, the minor group of potential modulators on PPARs, include berberine (30), which has been widely explored in preclinical and clinical studies for its potential beneficial effects on T2D and dyslipidemia.

"Naturally occurring cyclic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) such as tyrocidine A (Tyrc A) and gramicidin S (GS) are appealing targets for the development of novel antibiotics. However, their therapeutic potentials are limited by undesired hemolytic activity and relatively poor activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Inspired by polycationic lipopeptide polymyxin B (PMB), the so called 'last-resort' antibiotic for the treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, we synthesized and biologically evaluated a series of polycationic analogues derived from Tyrc A. We were able to obtain peptide 8 that possesses 5 positive charges exhibiting potent activities against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria along with totally diminished hemolytic activity. Intriguingly, antibacterial mechanism studies revealed that, rather than the 'pore forming' model that possessed by Tyrc A, peptide 8 likely diffuses membrane in a 'detergent-like' manner. Furthermore, when treating mice with peritonitis-sepsis, peptide 8 showed excellent antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities in vivo.","['possesses 5 positive charges exhibiting potent activities', 'naturally occurring cyclic antimicrobial peptides', 'peptide 8 likely diffuses membrane', 'peptide 8 showed excellent antibacterial', 'antibacterial mechanism studies revealed', 'polycationic lipopeptide polymyxin b', 'totally diminished hemolytic activity', 'obtain peptide 8', 'positive bacteria along', 'undesired hemolytic activity', 'polycationic analogues derived', 'relatively poor activity', 'inflammatory activities', 'treating mice', 'therapeutic potentials', 'pore forming', 'pmb ),', 'novel antibiotics', 'negative bacteria', 'negative bacteria', 'infections caused', 'biologically evaluated', 'appealing targets', 'resistant gram', 'negative', 'gram', 'gram', 'gram', 'vivo', 'tyrocidine', 'tyrc', 'tyrc', 'tyrc', 'treatment', 'synthesized', 'series', 'sepsis', 'resort', 'rather', 'possessed', 'peritonitis', 'multidrug', 'model', 'manner', 'limited', 'like', 'last', 'intriguingly', 'inspired', 'however', 'gs', 'gramicidin', 'furthermore', 'development', 'detergent', 'called', 'antibiotic', 'anti', 'amps', 'able']"
