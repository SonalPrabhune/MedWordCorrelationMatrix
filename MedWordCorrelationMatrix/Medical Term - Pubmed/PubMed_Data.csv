35051750,Improved cyclobutyl nabilone analogs as potent CB1 receptor agonists.,"['CB1 receptor', 'Cannabinoids', 'Nabilone analogs', 'SAR studies']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"In earlier work, we explored the SAR for the C3 side chain pharmacophore in the hexahydrocannabinol template represented by the drug nabilone, which resulted in the development of AM2389. In an effort for further optimization, we have merged features of nabilone and AM2389 and explored the C3 side chain with varying chain lengths and terminal substitutions. Of the compounds described here, a nabilone analog, AM8936, with the C6'-cyano-substituted side chain, was identified as the most successful analog capable of serving as a potential candidate for further development and a valuable tool for further in vivo studies. AM8936 behaved as a balanced and potent CB1 agonist in functional assays and was a potent and efficacious CB1 agonist in vivo. Our SAR studies are highlighted with the docking of AM8936 on the crystal structure of the hCB1 receptor.",,,,Copyright © 2021.

35051747,Recent advances in DDR (DNA damage response) inhibitors for cancer therapy.,"['DNA damage Response', 'Small molecule inhibitors', 'Synthetic lethality']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"DDR (DNA damage response) defects in cells drive tumor formation by promoting DNA mutations, which also provides cancer-specific vulnerabilities that can be targeted by synthetic lethality-based therapies. Until now, PARP inhibitors like olaparib are the first successful case of utilizing synthetic lethality-based therapy to treat cancers with DNA-repairing deficiency (e.g. BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation), which has fueled the search for more targetable components in the DDR signaling pathway by exploiting synthetic lethality, including but not limited to DNA-PK, ATR, ATM, CHK1, and WEE1. After years of efforts, numerous DDR kinase inhibitors have been discovered. Some of them are being investigated in clinical trials and have shown promising results for cancer therapy. In this review, we summarize the latest advancement in the development of DDR kinase inhibitors including those in preclinical stages and clinical trials, the crystal structures of DDR enzymes, and binding modes of inhibitors with target proteins.

In general, the fluorescence properties of the probes themselves could meet the imaging requirements, and they have shown sufficient inhibitory activities against c-Met, especially probe 16, reflecting the targeting and acceptance. Also, fluorescence polarization assays and flow cytometry analysis verified the binding between the probes and c-Met.

35033824,Novel PHD2/HDACs hybrid inhibitors protect against cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury.,"['Acute kidney injury', 'HDACs', 'Hybrid inhibitor', 'PHD2', 'Renal protecting']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Cisplatin is a common chemotherapeutic, but its nephrotoxicity-driven AKI limits its clinical application. Currently, there are no specific and satisfactory therapies in the clinic for AKI. Inhibitors of hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase 2 (HIF-PHD2) or histone deacetylase (HDACs) had shown renoprotective effects against AKI in preclinical studies. This study aimed to develop a novel therapeutic to prevent AKI progression by targeting PHD2 and HDACs simultaneously. We designed and synthesized a series of PHD2/HDACs hybrid inhibitors. The initial drug activity screening identified a candidate compound 31c, which exhibited potent inhibitory activities against PHD2 and HDAC1/2/6. Cellular analyses further showed that 31c did not affect cisplatin's antitumor activity in cancer cells but strongly protected cisplatin-induced toxicity on HK-2 cells. In vivo studies with the cisplatin-induced AKI mouse model demonstrated that 31c remarkably alleviated kidney dysfunction with suppressed plasma BUN/SCr and increased EPO levels. The potent renoprotective effects of 31c on AKI were confirmed by significant improvements in pathological kidney conditions in the mouse model. These results suggest that the novel PHD2/HDACs hybrid inhibitor, 31c, has a clinical potential as the renoprotective agent for the treatment/prevention of cisplatin-induced AKI for various cancers.",,,,Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In this study, more than 60 2,4-diaminopyrimidine derivatives were prepared to understand the structure-activity relationship and confirm the rationality of the pharmacophore model reported previously. Among them, compound 19k was found to be a potent pan-TRK inhibitor that inhibits the proliferation of Km-12 cell lines. Additionally, compound 19k induced the apoptosis of Km-12 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Western blot analysis revealed that compound 19k inhibited the phosphorylation of TRK to block downstream pathways. Compound 19k also possessed outstanding plasma stability and liver microsomal stability in vitro, with half-lives greater than 289.1 min and 145 min, respectively. Pharmacokinetic studies indicated that the oral bioavailability of compound 19k is 17.4%.

35007861,Potential applications of clickable probes in EGFR activity visualization and prediction of EGFR-TKI therapy response for NSCLC patients.,"['Click chemistry', 'Epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR)', 'Imaging', 'Irreversible inhibitors', 'Lung cancer']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"The epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR) is abnormally overexpressed on the cell surface of cancer cells and is strongly associated with cancer cell proliferation, migration, differentiation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Tools enabling the visualization of EGFR in a structure-function approach are highly desirable to predict EGFR mutations and guide EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment making. Here, we describe the design, synthesis, and application of new, potent and selective clickable probes 13 (HX03), 20 (HX04) and 24 (HX05) by introducing an alkyne ligation handle to visualize EGFR activity in living cancer cells and tissue slices. These clickable probes are versatile chemical tools based on the key pharmacophore (4-anilinoquinazoline) of EGFR-TKIs (e.g., canertinib, dacomitinib and afatinib) and are able to irreversibly target the kinase domain of EGFR. Among them, 13 exhibits the highest reactivity towards EGFR kinase, particularly to EGFR kinase with primary mutations. Using activity-based protein profiling strategy, 13 showed high sensitivity and selectivity in labeling of endogenous EGFR in a native cellular context. Moreover, 13 was applied to visualize EGFR mutant activity in tumour tissues from non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) xenograft mouse models, and patients with NSCLC for the prediction of EGFR-TKI sensitivity. These results demonstrate that strategically designed EGFR-TKI-based probes allow discriminating EGFR mutations in human tissues and hold promise as useful diagnostic tools in predicting EGFR-TKI therapy response.",,,,Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Lip-CTPP are promising potential carriers to exert the anti-glioma effect of DOX and LND collaboratively given the following features: 1) Lip-CTPP have a good pharmacokinetic behavior; 2) Lip-CTPP can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and recognize tumor cells through the affinity of p-HA and dopamine/sigma receptors; 3) Lip-CTPP are highly positive charged once the acid-sensitive amide bonds are cleaved in endo/lysosomes to expose TPP and protonate amine groups; 4) the positive charged Lip-CTPP escape from endo/lysosomes and accumulate in mitochondria through electrostatic adsorption; 5) DOX and LND are released and synergistically increase anti-tumor efficacy. Our in vitro and in vivo results confirmed that Lip-CTPP could greatly elevate the inhibition rate of tumor cell proliferation, migration and invasion, promote apoptosis and necrosis, and interfere with mitochondrial function. In addition, Lip-CTPP could significantly prolong the survival time of glioma bearing mice, narrow the tumor region and inhibit the infiltration and metastasis capability of glioma cells.

35007859,Fascaplysin derivatives binding to DNA via unique cationic five-ring coplanar backbone showed potent antimicrobial/antibiofilm activity against MRSA in vitro and in vivo.,"['Antibacterial', 'Antibiofilm', 'Fascaplysin derivatives', 'MRSA', 'Marine drugs', 'Mechanisms']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is considered as one of the most dangerous clinical pathogens. Biofilms forming ability of MRSA is also a major cause of drug resistance. Hence, it is in urgent need to develop novel antibacterial/antibiofilm drugs. Fascaplysin with a unique cationic five-ring coplanar backbone is emerging as a potential antibacterial compound. In this study, aiming at developing novel and more effective agents, a series of fascaplysin derivatives and their corresponding β-carboline precursors have been synthesized. Then their antibacterial/antibiofilm activity and mechanisms against MRSA were investigated for the first time. The results showed that most fascaplysins rather than β-carboline precursors exhibit superior antimicrobial activity against MRSA ATCC43300, demonstrating the important role of cationic five-ring coplanar backbone playing in antibacterial activity. Among them, 14 and 18 are the most potent compounds with MIC value of 0.098 μg/ml (10-fold lower than vancomycin), and 18 featuring the lowest toxicity. Subsequent mechanisms exploration indicates that 18 has relatively stronger ability to destroy bacterial cell wall and membrane, higher binding affinity to bacterial genomic DNA. Molecular docking study revealed that besides the key role of cationic five-ring coplanar backbone, introduction of N-aryl amide at 9-position of fascaplysin promoted the combination of compound 18 and DNA via additional π-π stacking and hydrogen bonding of the naphthyl group. Moreover, fascaplysins could inhibit MRSA biofilm formation in vitro and bacterial infection in vivo. All these results illustrate that fascaplysin derivative 18 is a strong and safe multi-target antibacterial agent, which makes it an attractive candidate for the treatment of MRSA and its biofilm infections.",,,,Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, excluding the great clinical success of PARP inhibitors, the concomitant toxicity, drug resistance, and limited scope of application restrict their clinical efficacy. To find solutions to these problems, dual-target inhibitors have shown great potential. In recent years, several studies have linked PAPR1 to other primary cancer targets. Many dual-target inhibitors have been developed using structural fusion, linkage, or library construction methods, overcoming the defects of many single-target inhibitors of PARP1 and achieving great success in clinical cancer therapy.

Since pyridines have been introduced into the skeleton of several families of compounds to enhance their pharmacological activity, and this approach had not yet been performed on squaraines, novel dyes derived from benz[e]indole functionalized with picolyl- and dipicolylamine and N-ethyl and -hexyl chains were designed and synthesized. After being fully characterized, their interaction with human albumin was in vitro and in silico evaluated. Dyes were further assessed for their phototoxicity activity, and the most interesting ones were studied regarding cell localization and induction of morphological cell changes, genotoxicity, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. The molecules with N-ethyl chains showed the greatest in vitro light-dependent cytotoxic effects, particularly the zwitterionic squaraine dye and the one bearing a single pyridine unit, which also exhibited a more significant interaction with human albumin. Phenotypically, the cells incubated with these squaraines became smaller and rounded after irradiation, the effects varying with the tested concentration. Genotoxic effects were observed even without irradiation, being more evident for the N-ethyl picolylamine-derived dye. The fluorescence emitted by Rhodamine 123 largely coincided with that emitted by the dyes, suggesting that they are found preferentially in mitochondria. After irradiation, an increase in the subG1 population was verified by propidium iodide-staining analysis by flow cytometry, indicative of cell death by apoptosis.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The linker is a key component, defining the ADC stability and mechanism of action, and particularly the drug release strategy. In this study, we have developed and synthesized a cleavable linker, which possesses an Asn-Pro-Val (NPV) sequence sensitive to the human neutrophil elastase (HNE), overexpressed in the tumor microenvironment. This linker permitted the site-specific conjugation of the cell-permeable drug, monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), onto trastuzumab, using a disulfide re-bridging technology. The resulting ADC was then evaluated in vitro. This conjugate demonstrated retained antigen (Ag) binding affinity and exhibited high subnanomolar potency against Ag-positive tumor cells after internalization, suggesting an intracellular mechanism of linker cleavage. While no internalization and cytotoxic activity of this ADC was observed on Ag-negative cells in classical conditions, the supplementation of exogenous HNE permitted to restore a nanomolar activity on these cells, suggesting an extracellular mechanism of drug release in these conditions. This in vitro proof of concept tends to prove that the NPV sequence could allow a dual intra- and extracellular mechanism of drug release. This work represents a first step in the design of original ADCs with a new dual intra- and extracellular drug delivery system and opens the way to further experimentations to evaluate their full potential in vivo.",,,,Copyright © 2021.

34971876,Discovery of 2H-chromone-4-one based sulfonamide derivatives as potent retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor γt inverse agonists.,"['Autoimmune diseases', 'IL-17A', 'Inverse agonists', 'RORγt', 'Sulfonamide derivatives']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"Retinoic acid receptor related orphan receptor γt (RORγt), identified as the essential functional regulator of IL-17 producing Th17 cells, is an attractive drug target for treating autoimmune diseases. Starting from the reported GSK2981278 (Phase II), we structurally modified and synthesized a series of 2H-chromone-4-one based sulfonamide derivatives as novel RORγt inverse agonists, which significantly improved their human metabolic stabilities while maintaining a potent RORγt inverse agonist profile. Efforts in reducing the lipophilicity and improving the LLE values led to the discovery of c9, which demonstrated potent RORγt inverse agonistic activity and consistent metabolic stability. During in vivo studies, oral administration of compound c9 exhibited a robust and dose-dependent inhibition of IL-17A cytokine expression and significantly lessened the skin inflammatory symptoms in the mouse imiquimod-induced skin inflammation model. Docking analysis of the binding mode revealed that c9 can suitably occupy the active pocket, and the introduction of the morpholine pyridine group can interact with Leu396, His479, and Cys393. Thus, compound c9 was selected as a preclinical compound for treating Th17-driven autoimmune diseases.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Its dysregulation has been linked to diverse central nervous system (CNS)-related disorders with a drastic impact on the aging population. Among them, tauopathies, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Frontotemporal Lobar degeneration (FTLD-tau), are neurodegenerative disorders pathologically defined by the presence of hyperphosphorylated tau-positive intracellular inclusions known as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Compelling evidence has reported the great potential of the simultaneous modulation of multiple protein kinases (PKs) involved in abnormal tau phosphorylation through a concerted pharmacological approach to achieve a superior therapeutic effect relative to classic ""one target, one drug"" approaches. Here, we report on the identification and characterization of ARN25068 (4), a low nanomolar and well-balanced dual GSK-3β and FYN inhibitor, which also shows inhibitory activity against DYRK1A, an emerging target in AD and tauopathies. Computational and X-Ray studies highlight compound 4's typical H-bonding pattern of ATP-competitive inhibitors at the binding sites of all three PKs. In a tau phosphorylation assay on Tau0N4R-TM-tGFP U2OS cell line, 4 reduces the extent of tau phosphorylation, promoting tau-stabilized microtubule bundles. In conclusion, this compound emerges as a promising prototype for further SAR explorations to develop potent and well-balanced triple GSK-3β/FYN/DYRK1A inhibitors to tackle tau hyperphosphorylation.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The previous study reported that the quadruple FFA1/PPAR-α/γ/δ agonist RLA8 provided better efficacy than obeticholic acid on NASH. In the present study, two design strategies were introduced to explore better quadruple FFA1/PPAR-α/γ/δ agonists with improved metabolic stability. These efforts ultimately resulted in the identification of ZLY18, a quadruple FFA1/PPAR-α/γ/δ agonist with twice higher metabolic half-life than RLA8 in the liver microsome.

Recent studies have strongly demonstrated that CDKs also has multiple functions, especially in response to extracellular and intracellular signals by interfering with transcriptional events. Consequently, how to inhibit their function has been a hot research topic. It is worth noting that the key role of CDKs in regulating transcription has been explored in recent years, but its related pharmacological targets are less developed, and most inhibitors have not entered the clinical stage. Accordingly, this perspective focus on the biological functions of transcription related CDKs and their complexes, some key upstream and downstream signals, and inhibitors for cancer treatment in recent years.

However, due to intrinsic and acquired resistance as well as poor drug tolerance, limited therapeutic efficacy has been achieved with these agents. In view of the fact that PI3K inhibitors can show synergistic antitumor effects with other cancer agents, namely mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitors, dual inhibition of both targets by a single-molecule is regarded as a promising complementary or alternative therapeutic strategy to overcome the drawbacks of just PI3K monotherapy. In this review, we discuss the theoretical foundation for designing PI3K-based dual-target inhibitors and summarize the structure-activity relationships and clinical progress of these dual-binding agents.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Herein, we report the LIN28 inhibitory activities of a series of 30 small molecules with a tricyclic tetrahydroquinoline (THQ)-containing scaffold obtained from a Povarov reaction. The THQ molecules were structurally optimized by varying the 2-benzoic acid substituent, the fused ring at 3- and 4-positions, and the substituents at the phenyl moiety of the tetrahydroquinoline core. Among the tested compounds, GG-43 showed dose-dependent inhibition in an EMSA validation assay and low micromolar inhibitory activity in a fluorescence polarization-based assay measuring disruption of LIN28-let-7 interaction. Binding mode between GG-43 and the cold shock domain of LIN28 was proposed via a molecular docking analysis. The study provides one of the first systematic analyses on structural features that are required for LIN28 inhibition, and indicates the necessity to develop small molecules with new scaffolds as LIN28-targeting probes and therapeutic candidates.

For tumor targeted and precision chemotherapy, we take the advantages of the ligand directed tumor active targeting of small molecule drug conjugates (SMDCs) and the passive tumor targeting of nanoparticles via the enhanced penetration and retention (EPR) effects, put forward a branched small molecule drug conjugate (BSMDC) nanomedicine design concept. In a proof of concept, we used pentaerythritol as the branched moiety, galactosamine (GalN) as the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) directing ligands, PTX as a payload, and a stearoyl moiety as the amphiphilic property adjusting group, designed and synthesized BSMDC 1 and prepared its NPs. In cellular level, the BSMDC 1 NPs targeted asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR)-overexpressing HepG2 cells, were effectively taken up in the cells and released in tumor microenvironments, inhibited the HepG2 cell proliferation, arrested HepG2 cell in G2/M phase and induced tumor cell apoptosis. In HepG2 xenograft nude mice, the BSMDC 1 NPs were high specific to target the tumor and demonstrated a higher antitumor efficiency than BSMDC 1, having no apparent influences on mice body weights and major organs, supporting our BSMDC nanomedicine design concept.

However, existing CDK12 inhibitors potently inhibit its closest isoform CDK13, which could cause potential toxicity. Therefore, the development of CDK12 inhibitors with isoform-selectivity against CDK13 continues to be a challenge. By taking advantage of the emerging PROteolysis-TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) approach, we have synthesized a potent PROTAC degrader PP-C8 based on the noncovalent dual inhibitors of CDK12/13 and demonstrated its specificity for CDK12 over CDK13. Notably, PP-C8 induces profound degradation of cyclin K simultaneously and downregulates the mRNA level of DNA-damage response genes. Global proteomics profiling revealed PP-C8 is highly selective toward CDK12-cyclin K complex. Importantly, PP-C8 demonstrates profound synergistic antiproliferative effects with PARP inhibitor in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).

34844141,Affinity-based protein profiling identifies vitamin D3 as a heat shock protein 70 antagonist that regulates hedgehog transduction in murine basal cell carcinoma.,"['Affinity-based protein profiling', 'Basal cell carcinoma', 'Heat shock protein 70', 'Hedgehog pathway inhibitor', 'Vitamin D3']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"Vitamin D3 (VD3) is a seco-steroid that inhibits the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. Initial studies suggested its anti-Hh activity results from direct inhibition of Smoothened, a seven-transmembrane cell surface receptor that is a key regulator of the Hh signaling cascade. More recently, a role for the Vitamin D Receptor in mediating inhibition of Hh-signaling by seco-steroid has been suggested. Herein, an affinity-based protein profiling study was carried out to better understand the cellular proteins that govern VD3-mediated anti-Hh activity. We synthesized a novel biotinylated VD3 analogue (8) for use as a chemical probe to explore cellular binding targets of the seco-steroidal scaffold. Through a series of pull-down experiments and follow up mass spectrum analyses, heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) was identified as a primary binding protein of VD3. Hsp70 was validated as a binding target of VD3 through a series of biochemical and cellular assays. VD3 bound with micromolar affinity to Hsp70. In addition, both selective knockdown of Hsp70 expression and pharmacological inhibition of its activity with known Hsp70 inhibitors suppressed Hh-signaling transduction in murine basal cell carcinoma cells, suggesting that Hsp70 regulates proper Hh-signaling. Additional cellular assays suggest that VD3 and its seco-steroidal metabolites inhibit Hh-signaling through different mechanisms.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

PAIB-SOs display significant selectivity toward human breast cancer cells based on the N-dealkylation of PAIB-SOs into their corresponding PIB-SOs by CYP1A1. In this study, we have evaluated the molecular mechanism of the bioactivation of PAIB-SOs into PIB-SOs by branching the linear alkyl chain on the imidazolidin-2-one (IMZ) moiety of PAIB-SOs by branched alkyl groups such as isopropyl, isobutyl and sec-butyl. Our results show that PAIB-SOs bearing an isobutyl group on the IMZ moiety and either a methoxy, a chloro or a bromo group at positions 3, 3,5 or 3,4,5 on the aromatic ring B exhibit antiproliferative activity ranging from 0.13 to 6.9 μM and selectivity toward MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 mammary cancer cells comparatively to other cell lines tested. Moreover, the most potent and selective PAIB-SOs bearing an isobutyl group and either a 3,5-Cl (44), 3,5-Br (45) or a 3,4,5-OMe (46) on the IMZ moiety exhibit antiproliferative activity in the sub-micromolar range and high selectivity ratios toward mammary cancer cells. They stop the cell cycle of MCF7 cells in the G2/M phase and disrupt their cytoskeleton. Furthermore, our studies evidenced that PAIB-SOs bearing either an isopropyl, a sec-butyl or an isobutyl group are hydroxylated on the carbon atom adjacent to the IMZ (Cα-OH) but only PAIB-SOs bearing an isobutyl group are bioactivated into PIB-SOs. Finally, PAIB-SOs 45 and 46 exhibit low toxicity toward normal cells and chick embryos and are thus promising antimitotic prodrugs highly selective toward CYP1A1-expressing breast cancer cells.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

It is thought that the separation of therapeutic efficacy (e.g., analgesia) from adverse effects (e.g., respiration depression) can be achieved through the design of biased MOR agonists and one example is the recently approved MOR biased agonist oliceridine (TRV130). However, oliceridine only demonstrates modest beneficial effects as compared to other opioids in terms of therapeutic/adverse effect balance. One possibility attributable to the modest success of oliceridine is its limited bias, and as such developing MOR ligands with a more biased agonism profile could in theory further improve the beneficial effects of the ligands. Here, we rationally designed and synthesized a series of derivatives as potent highly biased MOR agonists (19a-v) through the modification and structure-activity relationship study of TRV130.

However, significant compensatory regulation exists between these two signaling cascades, leading to redundancy among survival pathways. Consequently, initial clinical trials aimed at either PI3K or MEK inhibition alone have proven ineffective and highlight the need for development of targeted and innovative therapeutic combination strategies. We designed a series of PI3K inhibitor derivatives wherein a single morpholine group of the PI3K inhibitor ZSTK474 was substituted with a variety of 2-aminoethyl functional groups. Analogs with pendant hydroxyl or methoxy groups maintained low nanomolar inhibition towards PI3Kα, PI3Kγ, and PI3Kδ isoforms in contrast to those with pendant amino groups which were significantly less inhibitory. Synthesis of prototype PI3K/MEK bifunctional inhibitors (6r, 6s) was guided by the structure-activity data, where a MEK-targeting inhibitor was tethered directly via a short PEG linker to the triazine core of the PI3K inhibitor analogs.

The DNA superstructure formation by mono-quinoxaline derivatives is highly entropically favored and predominantly driven by hydrophobic interactions. Furthermore, oversupercoiling of DNA and base-destacking cumulatively induces histone eviction from in-vitro assembled nucleosomes at lower micromolar concentrations implicating biological relevance.

34801269,Dendronization: A practical strategy to improve the performance of molecular systems used in biomedical applications.,"['Biomarkers', 'Dendronization', 'Drugs', 'Multivalency', 'Nanomedicine', 'Solubility enhancement']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"Nanomedicine is an emerging area that largely influences the efficacy of various therapies through the rational design of new materials exhibiting more targeted behavior. The synthetic effort, the amount of used material, and the cost are critical parameters to bear in mind if the production of the designed material is intended to be scaled for their widespread use. Even though materials science offers diverse options for different types of therapies, it is a difficult task to meet all the parameters mentioned above. The dendronization appears as an insightful approach to incorporate all the known benefits of the dendritic architecture by the attachment of dendrons to therapeutic agents, but in a much more affordable manner in terms of synthetic effort, amount of material, and cost. As will be presented, the most common dendrons used for biomedical applications are polyamide, polyester, carbosilane, polyether, and glycol-type, which are bonded to biological active molecules (BAMs), or molecular nanoplatforms (MPs) by hydrolysable bonds. Also relevant is the fact that the incorporation of dendrons not larger than third generation (G3) is sufficient to improve essential properties of these molecular systems, such as aqueous solubility, stability, and cellular internalization, among others. The type of dendron and its location on the BAMs or MPs, similar to placing a Lego piece on a model, will be decisive for obtaining the desired properties.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Further anti-tumor mechanism studies revealed that compound 6t played as the inhibition of topoisomerase 1 (Top1), effectively induced apoptosis, obviously arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M phase, and significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of SGC-7901 and MGC-803 cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, the compound 6t was low toxicity in vivo and exhibited excellent anti-tumor activity (TGI = 70.12%) in the MGC-803 xenograft models. In summary, compound 6t represents a promising candidate as a potential chemotherapeutic agent against gastric cancer.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Among a library of screened molecules, MIR002 and GEM144 showed antiproliferative activity at nanomolar concentrations on a panel of human solid and haematological cancer cell lines. In vitro functional assays confirmed that these molecules inhibited POLA1 primer extension activity, as well as HDAC11. Molecular docking studies also supported these findings. Mechanistically, MIR002 and GEM144 induced acetylation of p53, activation of p21, G1/S cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Oral administration of these inhibitors confirmed their antitumor activity in in vivo models. In human non-small cancer cell (H460) xenografted in nude mice MIR002 at 50 mg/kg, Bid (qd × 5 × 3w) inhibited tumor growth (TGI = 61%). More interestingly, in POLA1 inhibitor resistant cells (H460-R9A), the in vivo combination of MIR002 with cisplatin showed an additive antitumor effect with complete disappearance of tumor masses in two animals at the end of the treatment. Moreover, in two human orthotopic malignant pleural mesothelioma xenografts (MM473 and MM487), oral treatments with MIR002 and GEM144 confirmed their significant antitumor activity (TGI = 72-77%).

The post-translational addition of mono or poly-ubiquitin molecules namely ""ubiquitinoylation"" is therefore pivotal to maintain the cell's vitality, maturation, differentiation, and division. Part of conserving homeostasis stems from maintaining the ubiquitin pool in the vicinity of the cell's intracellular environment; this crucial role is played by deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) that cleave ubiquitin molecules from target molecules. To date, they are categorized into 7 families with ubiquitin carboxyl c-terminal de-hydrolase family (UCH) as the most common and well-studied. Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L (UCH-L3) is a significant protein in this family as it has been implicated in many molecular and cellular processes with its mRNA identified in a range of body tissues including the brain. It goes without saying that it manifests in maintaining health and when abnormally regulated in disease. As it is an attractive small molecule drug target, scientists have used high throughput screening (HTS) and other drug discovery methods to discover inhibitors for this enzyme for the treatment of cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.

34749202,Dual target inhibitors based on EGFR: Promising anticancer agents for the treatment of cancers (2017-).,"['Anticancer', 'Design', 'Dual target inhibitors', 'EGFR', 'SARs']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"The EGFR family play a significant role in cell signal transduction and their overexpression is implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous human solid cancers. Inhibition of the EGFR-mediated signaling pathways by EGFR inhibitors is a widely used strategy for the treatment of cancers. In most cases, the EGFR inhibitors used in clinic were only effective when the cancer cells harbored specific activating EGFR mutations which appeared to preserve the ligand-dependency of receptor activation but altered the pattern of downstream signaling pathways. Moreover, cancer is a kind of multifactorial disease, and therefore manipulating a single target may result in treatment failure. Although drug combinations for the treatment of cancers proved to be successful, the use of two or more drugs concurrently still was a challenge in clinical therapy owing to various dose-limiting toxicities and drug-drug interactions caused by pharmacokinetic profiles changed. Therefore, a single drug targeting two or multiple targets could serve as an effective strategy for the treatment of cancers. In recent, drugs with diverse pharmacological effects have been shown to be more advantageous than combination therapies due to their lower incidences of side effects and more resilient therapies. Accordingly, dual target-single-agent strategy has become a popular field for cancer treatment, and researchers became more and more interest in the development of novel dual-target drugs in recent years. In this review, we briefly introduce the EGFR family proteins and synergisms between EGFR and other anticancer targets, and summarizes the development of potential dual target inhibitors based on wild-type and/or mutant EGFR for the treatment of solid cancers in the past five years. Additionally, the rational design and SARs of these dual target agents are also presented in detailed, which will lay a significant foundation for the further development of novel EGFR-based dual inhibitors with excellent druggability.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

34742017,Structure-activity relationship for the folding intermediate-selective inhibition of DYRK1A.,"[""Alzheimer's disease"", 'Autophosphorylation', 'DYRK1A', 'Down syndrome', 'FINDY', 'Folding intermediate']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"DYRK1A phosphorylates proteins involved in neurological disorders in an intermolecular manner. Meanwhile, during the protein folding process of DYRK1A, a transitional folding intermediate catalyzes the intramolecular autophosphorylation required for the ""one-off"" inceptive activation and stabilization. In our previous study, a small molecule termed FINDY (1) was identified, which inhibits the folding intermediate-catalyzed intramolecular autophosphorylation of DYRK1A but not the folded state-catalyzed intermolecular phosphorylation. However, the structural features of FINDY (1) responsible for this intermediate-selective inhibition remain elusive. In this study, structural derivatives of FINDY (1) were designed and synthesized according to its predicted binding mode in the ATP pocket of DYRK1A. Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) of the derivatives revealed that the selectivity against the folding intermediate is determined by steric hindrance between the bulky hydrophobic moiety of the derivatives and the entrance to the pocket. In addition, a potent derivative 3 was identified, which inhibited the folding intermediate more strongly than FINDY (1); it was designated as dp-FINDY. Although dp-FINDY (3) did not inhibit the folded state, as well as FINDY (1), it inhibited the intramolecular autophosphorylation of DYRK1A in an in vitro cell-free protein synthesis assay. Furthermore, dp-FINDY (3) destabilized endogenous DYRK1A in HEK293 cells. This study provides structural insights into the folding intermediate-selective inhibition of DYRK1A and expands the chemical options for the design of a kinase inhibitor.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Herein, to extend the scope of structure-activity relationships (SARs), fifteen indole-based carbamate derivatives (1-15) were prepared to evaluate the ATX inhibitory potency. Among them, compound 4 bearing morpholine moiety was identified as the optimal ATX inhibitor (0.41 nM), superior to the positive control GLPG1690 (2.90 nM). To resolve the intractable issue of poor pharmacokinetic (PK) property, urea moiety was introduced as a surrogate of carbamate which furnished compounds 16-30. The dedicated modification identified the diethanolamine entity 30 with satisfactory water solubility and PK profiles with a minimum sacrifice of ATX inhibition (2.17 nM). The most promising candidate 30 was evaluated for anti-fibrosis effect in a bleomycin challenged mice lung fibrosis model. Upon treatment with 30, the in vivo ATX activity in both lung homogenate and broncheoalveolar fluid (BALF) sample was significantly down-regulated. Furthermore, the gene expression of pro-fibrotic cytokines transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), interleukin- 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in lung tissue was reduced to normal level.

34735919,Structure-activity and mechanistic studies of non-peptidic inhibitors of the PLK1 polo box domain identified through REPLACE.,"['Cancer', 'INHIBITOR', 'PLK1', 'Peptidomimetic', 'Polo-like kinase', 'REPLACE', 'Therapeutic']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is a serine/threonine-protein kinase involved in cell cycle regulation and mitotic progression. Studies have shown that PLK1 is upregulated in many tumors and high levels are adversely related to a poor prognosis. Knocking down or inhibiting PLK1 results in synthetic lethality in PTEN deficient prostate tumors and Kras mutant colorectal tumors, further validating PLK1 as an oncotarget. Substrate recognition by PLK1 occurs through the Polo-Box Domain (PBD), which is a phospho-peptide binding site also responsible for subcellular localization. Much effort has been directed to target this kinase therapeutically through the ATP-binding site, and a few such inhibitors have advanced to clinical trials however with limited clinical efficacy. Moreover, it has been shown that a point mutation in PLK1 (C67V) confers dramatic cellular resistance to catalytic site inhibitors. An alternative approach to target PLK1 potently and selectively is through the PBD to block its protein-protein interactions. Through the REPLACE strategy, for converting peptide inhibitors into more drug-like non peptidic compounds, a PBD targeting compound series (""ABBAs""), has been identified and the key determinants of potency and selectivity elucidated through structure-activity relationship studies. In cellular experiments, the ABBAs were shown to lead to profound effects on the cell cycle, to inhibit tumor proliferation and overcome resistance of cells expressing the PLK1 C67V mutant to ATP-based inhibitors. These non-ATP competitive inhibitors of PLK1 were also used chemical biology probes to investigate the gene regulatory effects of PLK1, known to act on transcription factors such as p53.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In vitro cytotoxicity of these molecules was evaluated using the MTT assay. Based on the assay results, we selected the conjugate which showed cytotoxic potential close to unmodified docetaxel. At the same time, the molar solubility of the resulting compound increased up to 20 times in comparison with the drug itself. In vivo evaluation on 22Rv1 (PSMA+) xenograft model demonstrated a good potency of the synthesized conjugate to inhibit tumor growth: the inhibition turned out to be more than 80% at a dose of 30 mg/kg. Pharmacokinetic parameters of conjugate distribution were analyzed. Also, it was found that PSMA-targeted docetaxel conjugate is less toxic than docetaxel itself, the decrease of molar acute toxicity in comparison with free docetaxel was up to 20%.

The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the individual scaffolds can be improved by developing coumarin-benzimidazole chimeric molecules via molecular hybridization approach. The three major classes of coumarin-benzimidazole hybrids are merged, fused and spacer-linked hybrids. Depending on the substitution position, fused hybrids and spacer-linked hybrids can be further classified as coumarin-C3 hybrids, coumarin-C4 hybrids and coumarin-C5/6/7/8 hybrids. Most of the coumarin-benzimidazole hybrid molecules exhibited potent anticancer, antiviral, antimicrobial, antitubercular, anthelmintic, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticonvulsant and carbonic anhydrase inhibitory activities. The fused coumarin-C3 hybrid (2), thiomethylene-linked coumarin-C3 hybrid (45), N-glucoside substituted thiomethylene-linked coumarin-C3 hybrid (37c), amide-linked coumarin-C3 hybrid (50a), and sulfonylmethylene-linked coumarin-C4 hybrid (63) were identified as the representative potent anticancer, antimicrobial, antiviral, antioxidant and antitubercular agents respectively. The biological properties of the different classes of coumarin-benzimidazole hybrids with their structure-activity relationship studies and the mechanism of action studies were presented in this review, aiming to help the researchers across the globe to generate future hybrid molecules as potential drug candidates.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The IQ structural framework consists of four isomeric ring systems differing via the linkage of indole with quinoline as [3,2-b], [3,2-c], [2,3-c], and [2,3-b]. Structurally, IQs are planar and thus they bind strongly to the DNA which largely contributes to their biological properties. The structural rigidity and associated nonspecific cellular toxicity is a key shortcoming of the IQ structural framework for preclinical development. Thus, the lead optimization efforts were aimed at improving the therapeutic window and ADME properties of IQs. The structural modifications mainly involved attaching the basic aminoalkyl chains that positively modulates the vital physicochemical and topological parameters, thereby improves biological activity. Our analysis has found that the aminoalkylation consistently improved the selectivity index and provided acceptable in-vivo antimalarial/anticancer activity.

Here Leu317 in Loop II was discovered as a new functional site to combat drug-resistance in Mycobacterium strains. Based on TCA1, LZDT1 was designed to optimize the hydrophobic interaction with Leu317. A subsequent biochemical and cellular assay displayed increased potency of LZDT1 in inhibiting DprE1 and killing drug-sensitive/-resistant Mycobacterium strains. The improved activity of LZDT1 and its analogue LZDT2 against multidrug resistant tuberculosis was particularly highlighted. For LZDT1, its enhanced interaction with Leu317 also impaired the drug-insensitivity of DprE1 caused by Cys387 mutation. A new nonbenzothiazole lead (LZDT10) with reduced Cys387-dependence was further produced by optimizing interactions with Leu317, improvement directions for LZDT10 were discussed as well.

The goal of vaccination is to induce a robust immune response against a specific antigen, thus preventing the organism from getting infected. In vaccines, adjuvants have been widely employed to enhance immunity against specific antigens. An ideal adjuvant should be stable, biodegradable, and low cost, not induce system rejection and promote an immune response. Various adjuvant components have been investigated across diverse applications. Typically, adjuvants are employed to meet the following objectives: (1) to improve the effectiveness of immunization with vaccines for specific populations, such as newborns and the elderly; (2) enhance the immunogenicity of highly purified or recombinant antigens; (3) allow immunization with a smaller dose of the vaccine, reducing drug dosage.

34656042,Balancing the efficacy vs. the toxicity of promiscuous natural products: Paclitaxel-based acid-labile lipophilic prodrugs as promising chemotherapeutics.,"['Leukopenia', 'Low-density lipoprotein', 'Paclitaxel', 'Prodrugs', 'Transacetalization', 'Xenograft']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"TumorSelect® is an anticancer technology that combines cytotoxics, nanotechnology, and knowledge of human physiology to develop innovative therapeutic interventions with minimal undesirable side effects commonly observed in conventional chemotherapy. Tumors have a voracious appetite for cholesterol which facilitates tumor growth and fuels their proliferation. We have transformed this need into a stealth delivery system to disguise and deliver anticancer drugs with the assistance of both the human body and the tumor cell. Several designer prodrugs are incorporated within pseudo-LDL nanoparticles, which carry them to tumor tissues, are taken up, internalized, transformed into active drugs, and inhibit cancer cell proliferation. Highly lipophilic prodrug conjugates of paclitaxel suitable for incorporation into the pseudo-LDL nanoparticles of the TumorSelect® delivery vehicle formulation were designed, synthesized, and evaluated in the panel of 24-h NCI-60 human tumor cell line screening to demonstrate the power of such an innovative approach. Taxane prodrugs, viz., ART-207 was synthesized by tethering paclitaxel to lipid moiety with the aid of a racemic solketal as a linker in cost-effective, simple, and straightforward synthetic transformations. In addition to the typical 24-h NCI screening protocol, these compounds were assessed for growth inhibition or killing of ovarian cell lines for 48 and 72h-time intervals and identified the long-lasting effectiveness of these lipophilic prodrugs. All possible, enantiomerically pure isomers of ART-207 were also synthesized, and cytotoxicities were biosimilar to racemic ART-207, suggesting that enantiopurity of linker has a negligible effect on cell proliferation. To substantiate further, ART-207 was evaluated for its in vivo tumor reduction efficacy by studying the xenograft model of ovarian cancer grown in SCID mice. Reduced weight loss (a measure of toxicity) in the ART-207 group was observed, even though it was dosed at 2.5x the paclitaxel equivalent of Abraxane®. As a result, our delineated approach is anticipated to improve patient quality of life, patient retention in treatment regimes, post-treatment rapid recovery, and overall patient compliance without compromising the efficacy of the cytotoxic promiscuous natural products.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

34649064,Structure modification and biological evaluation of indole-chalcone derivatives as anti-tumor agents through dual targeting tubulin and TrxR.,"['Anti-tumor activity', 'Dual-targeting inhibitor', 'Microtubule targeting agents', 'TrxR']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"Microtubule target agents (MTAs) are widely-used clinical anti-cancer drugs for decades, but the acquired drug resistance severely restricted their application. Thioredoxin reductases (TrxR) was reported to be overexpressed in most tumors and closely related to high risk of cancer recurrence and drug resistance, making it a potential target for anticancer drug discovery. Multi-target-directed ligands (MTDLs) by a single molecule provide a logical and alternative approach to drug combinations. In this work, based on the structure-activity relationships obtained in our previous study, some structure modifications were performed. On one hand, the retained skeleton structure of MTAs endowed its tubulin polymerization inhibition activity, on the other hand, the selenium-containing structure and α,β-unsaturated ketone moiety endowed the TrxR inhibition activity. As results, the newly obtained compounds exhibited superior anti-proliferative activities towards various human cancer cells and drug-resistance cells, and displayed high selectivity towards various human normal cells. The mechanism study revealed that the dual effect of cell cycle arrest triggered by targeting tubulin and the abnormal accumulation of ROS caused by TrxR inhibition eventually lead to cell apoptosis. Notably, compared with the MTA agents CA-4P, and the TrxR inhibitor Ethaselen, the optimized compound 14c, which served as dual-targeting inhibitor of tubulin and TrxR, exerted greatly improved in vivo anti-tumor activity. In summary, 14c deserved further consideration for cancer therapy.",,,,Copyright © 2021.

34638033,An efficient strategy for digging protein-protein interactions for rational drug design - A case study with HIF-1α/VHL.,"['Alanine scanning', 'HIF-1α/VHL', 'Protein-protein interaction', 'Site-directed mutagenesis', 'Stroke']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"The ubiquitination of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is mediated by interacting with the von Hippel-Lindau protein (VHL), and is associated with cancer, chronic anemia, and ischemia. VHL, an E3 ligase, has been reported to degrade HIF-1 for decades, however, there are few successful inhibitors currently. Poor understanding of the binding pocket and a lack of in-depth exploration of the interactions between two proteins are the main reasons. Hence, we developed an effective strategy to identify and design new inhibitors for protein-protein interaction targets. The hydroxyproline (Hyp564) of HIF-1α contributed the key interaction between HIF-1α and VHL. In this study, detailed information of the binding pocket were explored by alanine scanning, site-directed mutagenesis and molecular dynamics simulations. Interestingly, we found the interaction(s) between Y565 and H110 played a key role in the binding of VHL/HIF-1α. Based on the interactions, 8 derivates of VH032, 16a-h, were synthesized by introducing various groups bounded to H110. Further assay on protein and cellular level exhibited that 16a-h accessed higher binding affinity to VHL and markable or modest improvement in stabilization of HIF-1α or HIF-1α-OH in HeLa cells. Our work provides a new orientation for the modification or design of VHL/HIF-1α protein-protein interaction inhibitors.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Analysis of the crystallographic data available for the human CA isoform II in adduct with two coumarin CAIs and some CAAs showed that both types of CA modulators bind in the same region of the enzyme active site, basically interacting with superimposable amino acid residues, that are Trp5, Asn62, His64, Asn67, Gln92, Thr200. A plethora of water molecules also participate in the adducts formation. This structural analysis showed that presence of certain chemical groups in the compound structure is mandatory to produce an activating rather than inhibitory action, such as multiple nitrogen- and oxygen-based moieties capable of shuttling protons or forming extended H-bond networks nearby the proton shuttle residue.

34628237,Reactive metabolites of the anticonvulsant drugs and approaches to minimize the adverse drug reaction.,"['Adverse effect', 'Antiepileptic drugs', 'Arene oxide', 'Bioactivation process', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Reactive metabolite']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"Several generations of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are available in the market for the treatment of seizures, but these are amalgamated with acute to chronic side effects. The most common side effects of AEDs are dose-related, but some are idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions (ADRs) that transpire due to the formation of reactive metabolite (RM) after the bioactivation process. Because of the adverse reactions patients usually discontinue the medication in between the treatment. The AEDs such as valproic acid, lamotrigine, phenytoin etc., can be categorized under such types because they form the RM which may prevail with life-threatening adverse effects or immune-mediated reactions. Hepatotoxicity, teratogenicity, cutaneous hypersensitivity, dizziness, addiction, serum sickness reaction, renal calculi, metabolic acidosis are associated with the metabolites of drugs such as arene oxide, N-desmethyldiazepam, 2-(1-hydroxyethyl)-2-methylsuccinimide, 2-(sulphamoy1acetyl)-phenol, E-2-en-VPA and 4-en-VPA and carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, etc. The major toxicities are associated with the moieties that are either capable of forming RM or the functional groups may itself be too reactive prior to the metabolism. These functional groups or fragment structures are typically known as structural alerts or toxicophores. Therefore, minimizing the bioactivation potential of lead structures in the early phases of drug discovery by a modification to low-risk drug molecules is a priority for the pharmaceutical companies. Additionally, excellent potency and pharmacokinetic (PK) behaviour help in ensuring that appropriate (low dose) candidate drugs progress into the development phase. The current review discusses about RMs in the anticonvulsant drugs along with their mechanism vis-a-vis research efforts that have been taken to minimize the toxic effects of AEDs therapy.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

34628234,Screening S protein - ACE2 blockers from natural products: Strategies and advances in the discovery of potential inhibitors of COVID-19.,"['ACE2', 'COVID-19', 'Drug screening technology', 'Natural products', 'S protein']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"The Coronavirus disease, 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which poses a major threat to human life and health. Given its continued development, limiting the spread of COVID-19 in the population remains a challenging task. Currently, multiple therapies are being tried around the world to deal with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a variety of studies have shown that natural products have a significant effect on COVID-19 patients. The combination of SARS-CoV-2 S protein with Angiotensin converting enzyme II(ACE2) of host cell to promote membrane fusion is an initial critical step for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, screening natural products that inhibit the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and ACE2 also provides a feasible strategy for the treatment of COVID-19. Establishment of high throughput screening model is an important basis and key technology for screening S protein-ACE2 blockers. Based on this, the molecular structures of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 and their processes in the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and host cell infection were firstly reviewed in this paper, with emphasis on the methods and techniques of screening S protein-ACE2 blockers, including Virtual Screening (VS), Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), Biochromatography, Biotin-avidin with Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent assay and Gene Chip Technology. Furthermore, the technical principle, advantages and disadvantages and application scope were further elaborated. Combined with the application of the above screening technologies in S protein-ACE2 blockers, a variety of natural products, such as flavonoids, terpenoids, phenols, alkaloids, were summarized, which could be used as S protein-ACE2 blockers, in order to provide ideas for the efficient discovery of S protein-ACE2 blockers from natural sources and contribute to the development of broad-spectrum anti coronavirus drugs.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

34619465,Inhibition of Histone Deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) as a therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease: A review (2010-2020).,"['Alzheimer’ s disease', 'HDAC6 structure', 'Histone deacetylase 6', 'Multitarget inhibitors', 'Selective HDAC6 inhibitors']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, which is characterized by the primary risk factor, age. Several attempts have been made to treat AD, while most of them end in failure. However, with the deepening study of pathogenesis of AD, the expression of HDAC6 in the hippocampus, which plays a major role of the memory formation, is becoming worth of notice. Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), a remarkable lesion in AD, has been characterized in association with the abnormal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated Tau, which is mainly caused by the high expression of HDAC6. On the other hand, the hypoacetylated tubulin induced by HDAC6 is also fatal for the neuronal transport, which is the key impact of the formation of axons and dendrites. Overall, the significantly increased expression of HDAC6 in brain regions is deleterious to neuron survival in AD patients. Based on the above research, the inhibition of HDAC6 seems to be a potential therapeutic method for the treatment of AD. Up to now, various types of HDAC6 inhibitors have been discovered. This review mainly analyzes the HDAC6 inhibitors reported amid 2010-2020 in terms of their structure, selectivity and pharmacological impact towards AD. And we aim at facilitating the design and development of better HDAC6 inhibitors in the future.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Functional deletion of UTs led to urea-selective urinary concentrating defects with relative salt sparing. In our previous study, a UT inhibitor with a diarylamide scaffold, which is denoted as 11a, was demonstrated as the first orally available UT inhibitor. However, the oral bioavailability of 11a was only 4.38%, which obstructed its clinical application. In this work, by replacing the nitro group of 11a with an acetyl group, 25a was obtained. Compared with 11a, 25a showed a 10 times stronger inhibitory effect on UT-B (0.14 μM vs. 1.41 μM in rats, and 0.48 μM vs. 5.82 μM in mice) and a much higher inhibition rate on UT-A1. Moreover, the metabolic stability both in vitro and in vivo and the drug-like properties (permeability and solubility) of 25a were obviously improved compared with those of 11a. Moreover, the bioavailability of 25a was 15.18%, which was 3 times higher than that of 11a, thereby resulting in significant enhancement of the diuretic activities in rats and mice. 25a showed excellent potential for development as a promising clinical diuretic candidate for targeting UTs to treat diseases that require long-term usage of diuretics, such as hyponatremia.",,,,Copyright © 2021.

34563965,The heat shock response and small molecule regulators.,"['Cancer', 'HSF1', 'Heat shock response', 'Hsp90', 'Neurodegeneration']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"The heat shock response (HSR) is a highly conserved cellular pathway that is responsible for stress relief and the refolding of denatured proteins [1]. When a host cell is exposed to conditions such as heat shock, ischemia, or toxic substances, heat shock factor-1 (HSF-1), a transcription factor, activates the genes that encode for the heat shock proteins (Hsps), which are a family of proteins that work alongside other chaperones to relieve stress and refold proteins that have been denatured (Burdon, 1986) [2]. Along with the refolding of denatured proteins, Hsps facilitate the removal of misfolded proteins by escorting them to degradation pathways, thereby preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins [3]. Research has indicated that many pathological conditions, such as diabetes, cancer, neuropathy, cardiovascular disease, and aging have a negative impact on HSR function and are commonly associated with misfolded protein aggregation [4,5]. Studies indicate an interplay between mitochondrial homeostasis and HSF-1 levels can impact stress resistance, proteostasis, and malignant cell growth, which further support the role of Hsps in pathological and metabolic functions [6]. On the other hand, Hsp activation by specific small molecules can induce the heat shock response, which can afford neuroprotection and other benefits [7]. This review will focus on the modulation of Hsps and the HSR as therapeutic options to treat these conditions.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

As a novel category of antitumor agents, histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) can induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation in cancer cells, ultimately combating cancer. Although in the United States, the use of HDACis for the treatment of certain cancers has been approved, the therapeutic efficacy of HDACis as a single therapeutic agent in solid tumorshas been unsatisfactory and drug resistance may yet occur. To enhance therapeutic efficacy and limit drug resistance, numerous combination therapies involving HDACis in synergy with other antitumor therapies have been studied. In this review, we describe the classification of HDACs. Moreover, we summarize the antitumor mechanism of the HDACis for targeting key cellular processes of cancers (cell cycle, apoptosis, angiogenesis, DNA repair, and immune response). In addition, we outline the major developments of other antitumor therapies in combination with HDACis, including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, phototherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. Finally, we discuss the current state and challenges of HDACis-drugs combinations in future clinical studies, with the aim of optimizing the antitumor effect of such combinations.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Metal complexes are an untapped source of antibiotic potential owing to unique modes of action and a wider range of three-dimensional geometries as compared to purely organic compounds.

One potential therapeutic strategy to prevent the loss of photoreceptors in these conditions is to identify opsin-binding compounds that act as chemical chaperones for opsin, aiding its proper folding and trafficking to the outer cell membrane. Aiming to identify novel compounds with such effect, a rational ligand-based approach was applied to the structure of the visual pigment chromophore, 11-cis-retinal, and its locked analogue 11-cis-6mr-retinal. Following molecular docking studies on the main chromophore binding site of rhodopsin, 49 novel compounds were synthesized according to optimized one-to seven-step synthetic routes. These agents were evaluated for their ability to compete for the chromophore binding site of opsin, and their capacity to increase the trafficking of the P23H opsin mutant from the ER to the cell membrane. Different new molecules displayed an effect in at least one assay, acting either as chemical chaperones or as stabilizers of the 9-cis-retinal-rhodopsin complex.

In this study, we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of the β-glucuronidase-reactive albumin-binding prodrug Mal-glu-CPTS0001 based on quaternary ammonium. After intravenous administration, the compound covalently binds to plasma albumin through Michael addition, enabling it to accumulate in tumours, where tumour-associated β-glucuronidase triggers the selective release of CPTS0001. This prodrug significantly reduced the toxicity of the parent drug, and the maximum tolerated dose was increased by 2.5 times. At the same time, this prodrug enhanced the selectivity in vivo and improved the preferential accumulation of prodrug in tumours.

For the last 40 years, control of schistosomiasis in endemic regions has predominantly been facilitated by administration of a single drug, praziquantel. Due to limitations in this mono-chemotherapeutic approach for sustaining schistosomiasis control into the future, alternative anti-schistosomal compounds are increasingly being sought by the drug discovery community. Herein, we describe a multi-pronged, integrated strategy that led to the identification and further exploration of the quinoxaline core as a promising anti-schistosomal scaffold.

The GLASS (GPCR-Ligand Association) database was screened using a pharmacophore model. The most promising novel ligand structures were chosen and then tested in cellular assays (calcium mobilization and β-arrestin assays). Amongst the selected ligands, two pyrrolidinone compounds (7 and 8) turned out to be the most active. Moreover compound 7 was able to reduce the number of adherent neutrophils in a human neutrophil static adhesion assay which indicates its anti-inflammatory and proresolving properties. Further exploration and optimization of new ligands showed that heterocyclic rings, e.g. pyrazole directly connected to the pyrrolidinone scaffold, provide good stability and a boost in the agonistic activity. The compounds of most interest (7 and 30) were tested in an ERK phosphorylation assay, demonstrating selectivity towards FPR2 over FPR1.

Although the mechanism of action of INM is not yet fully understood, recent studies have indicated that it acts at an early stage of the coronaviruses (CoVs) replication cycle. In addition, a proteomic study reported that the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of INM could be also ascribed to its ability to inhibit human prostaglandin E synthase type 2 (PGES-2), a host protein which interacts with the SARS-CoV-2 NSP7 protein. Although INM does not potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in infected Vero E6 cells, here we have explored for the first time the application of the Proteolysis Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs) technology in order to develop more potent INM-derived PROTACs with anti-CoV activity. In this study, we report the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a series of INM-based PROTACs endowed with antiviral activity against a panel of human CoVs, including different SARS-CoV-2 strains. Two PROTACs showed a strong improvement in antiviral potency compared to INM.

Antimicrobial peptidomimetics represent a promising approach for overcoming antibiotic resistance. Herein we report the synthesis and evaluation of indole-based amphiphilic antimicrobial peptidomimetics, bearing hydrophobic side chains and hydrophilic cationic moieties. Among these derivatives, compound 28 demonstrated potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, low hemolytic activity and low toxicity towards mammalian cells, as well as good stability in salt conditions. Moreover, compound 28 showed the rapid killing of bacteria via membrane-targeting action without developing bacterial resistance. More importantly, compound 28 displayed high antimicrobial potency against Gram-positive bacteria in a murine model of bacterial keratitis, and was found to be more efficient than vancomycin. Thus, compound 28 had great potential as a promising lead compound for the treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infection.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

MCT1 and MCT4 and LAT1 play vital roles in tumour metabolism and growth by taking up nutrients and are thus potential targets for tumour therapy. An increasing number of studies have shown the feasibility of including these transporters as components of tumour-targeting therapy. Here, we summarize the recent progress in MCT1-, MCT4-and LAT1-based therapeutic strategies. First, protein structures, expression, relationships with cancer, and substrate characteristics are introduced. Then, different drug targeting and delivery strategies using these proteins have been reviewed, including designing protein inhibitors, prodrugs and nanoparticles. Finally, a dual targeted strategy is discussed because these proteins exert a synergistic effect on tumour proliferation. This article concentrates on tumour treatments targeting MCT1, MCT4 and LAT1 and delivery techniques for improving the antitumour effect.

34507011,Targeted methylation facilitates DNA double strand breaks and enhances cancer suppression: A DNA intercalating/methylating dual-action chimera Amonafidazene.,"['Amonafide', 'Anticancer', 'DNA double Strand break', 'DNA methylation', 'Molecular chimera', 'O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"A DNA intercalating agent Amonafide interferes with topoisomerase 2 (Topo II) activity and prevents re-ligation of DNA strands, leading to double strand breaks (DSB). If DSB repair fails, cells stop dividing and eventually die. In a search of approaches to enhance anti-cancer activities of Topo II inhibitors, we hypothesized that introduction of additional damage in proximity to the DSB may suppress DNA repair and enhance cancer cell killing. Accordingly, chimeric molecules were created that target a DNA alkylating component to the proximity of Topo II-induced DSBs. These chimeras consist of Amonafide or its 4-amino isomer, and DNA methylating methyl triazene moiety Azene protected with a carbamate group, connected via linker. Treatment of cancer cells with the chimeric molecules leads to significantly higher number of DSBs, which were repaired slower compared to Amonafide or monomethyl triazene-treated cells. On the other hand, methyl triazene linked to non-intercalating Amonafide analogs was ineffective. Together, these data strongly support our hypothesis. In line with increased DSBs, the chimeric molecules exhibited significantly higher antiproliferative activity in cancer cell lines compared to Amonafide or monomethyl triazene constituent Azene. We utilized the fluorescent properties of chimera Amonafidazene to develop ''photo-switchable'' reporting system to monitor the prodrug activation.

34479036,Synthetically-tailored and nature-derived dual COX-2/5-LOX inhibitors: Structural aspects and SAR.,"['5-Lipoxygenase', 'Arachidonic acid pathway', 'Cyclooxygenase-2', 'Dual COX-2/5-LOX inhibitors', 'Inflammation']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"Inflammation is a most complex pathological process that gives birth to different diseases. Different inflammatory mediators are released during an inflammation responsible for acute pain and chronic inflammatory diseases like cancer, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, neurodegenerative diseases, metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. The arachidonic acid pathway, which results in the production of inflammatory mediators, provides several targets for anti-inflammatory intervention. The most popularly used medications for inflammation are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) but it has some limitations, in particular traditional NSAIDs which inhibit the COX pathway non-selectively, producing gastrointestinal side effects, and other adverse effects like stroke and renal failure. On the other hand, selective COX-2 inhibitors commonly known as 'coxibs' produce cardiovascular side effects. Frequent inhibition of either cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase enzyme switches the metabolism of arachidonic acid from one to another which could lead to serious consequences. Therefore, a need to develop novel, effective and safe anti-inflammatory agents which can inhibit the release of both prostaglandins and leukotrienes from the respective cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways has emerged. This resulted in the discovery of new anti-inflammatory agents derived from natural and synthetic sources as dual COX-2/5-LOX inhibitors. To further contribute towards the discovery in this field, we have attempted to summarize structural features and pharmacological activities of heterocyclic scaffolds and natural products explored as dual COX-2/5-LOX inhibitors. We have emphasized the designing of the dual inhibitors inspired by the previously reported COX-2 and 5-LOX inhibitors. This outline could render us to identify the best pharmacophores catering to dual COX-2/5-LOX inhibitory activity while improving their efficiency as anti-inflammatory agents.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Developing novel broad-spectrum bactericides cannot solve the resistance problem, and may even aggravate it. The design of specific and selective bactericides has become urgent. A specific bactericidal design strategy was proposed by introducing exogenous metabolites in this study. This strategy was used to optimize two known antibacterial agents, luteolin (M) and Isoprothiolane (D), against Xoo. Based on the prodrug principles, target compound MB and DB were synthesized by combing M or D with exogenous metabolites, respectively. Bactericidal activity test results demonstrated that while the antibacterial ability of target compounds was significantly improved, their selectivity was also well enhanced by the introducing of exogenous metabolites. Comparing with the original compound, the antibacterial activity of target compound was significantly increased 92.0% and 74.5%, respectively. The optimized target compounds were more easily absorbed, and the drug application concentrations were much lower than those of the original agents, which would greatly reduce environmental pollution and relieve resistance risk.

With the multifactorial nature of cancer, and the fast development of drug resistance for conventional chemotherapeutics, a strategy for designing multi-target agents was suggested to potentially increase drug efficacy, minimize side effects and retain the proper pharmacokinetic properties. Kinase inhibitors were used extensively in such strategy. Different kinase inhibitor agents which target EGFR, VEGFR, c-Met, CDK, PDK and other targets were merged into hybrids with conventional chemotherapeutics such as tubulin polymerization and topoisomerase inhibitors. Other hybrids were designed gathering kinase inhibitors with targeted cancer therapy such as HDAC, PARP, HSP 90 inhibitors.

A series of novel compounds with highly efficient inhibiting the expression of inflammatory factors were designed by using 4-indolyl-2-aminopyrimidine as the core skeleton. Totally eleven 4-indolyl-2-arylaminopyrimidine derivatives were designed and synthesized. As well, the related anti-ALI activity of these compounds was evaluated. Compounds 6c and 6h showed a superior activity among these compounds, and the inhibition rate of IL-6 and IL-8 release ranged from 62% to 77%, and from 65% to 72%, respectively. Furthermore, most of compounds had no significant cytotoxicity in vitro. The infiltration of inflammatory cells into lung tissue significantly reduced by using compound 6h (20 mg/kg) in the ALI mice model, which achieved the effect of protecting lung tissue and improving ALI. In addition, the inflammatory response was inhibited by using compound 6h through inhibiting phosphorylation of p-38 and ERK in MAPK signaling pathway, and resulted in protective effect on ALI. These data indicated that compound 6h showed good anti-inflammatory activity in vitro and in vivo, which was expected to become a leading compound for the treatment of ALI.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, the drug resistance of 5-FU has caused high mortality of CRC patients. Thus, it is urgent to develop reversal agents of 5-FU resistance. Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 2 (S1PR2) was proved to be a potential target for reversing 5-FU resistance, but the activity of known S1PR2 antagonists JTE-013 were weak in 5-FU-resistant cell lines. To develop more potent S1PR2 antagonists to treat 5-FU-resistant cancer, a series of JTE-013 derivatives were designed and synthesized. The most promising compound 40 could markedly reverse the resistance in 5-FU-resistant HCT116 cells and 5-FU-resistant SW620 cells via inhibiting the expression of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). The key was that compound 40 with improved pharmacokinetic properties significantly increased the inhibitory rate of 5-FU in the SW620/5-FU cells xenograft model with no observable toxicity by inhibiting the expression of DPD in tumor and liver tissues. Altogether, these results suggest that compound 40 may be a promising drug candidate to reverse 5-FU resistance in the treatment of CRC.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Nowadays, they still represent invaluable resources for the treatment of many diseases, including bacterial infections. After nearly three decades since the World Health Organization's (WHO) declaration of tuberculosis (TB) as a global health emergency, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) continues to claim millions of lives, remaining among the leading causes of death worldwide. In the last years, several efforts have been devoted to shortening and improving treatment outcomes, and to overcoming the increasing resistance phenomenon. Nature has always provided a virtually unlimited source of bioactive molecules, which have inspired the development of new drugs. NPs are characterized by an exceptional chemical and structural diversity, the result of millennia of evolutionary responses to various stimuli. Thanks to their favorable structural features and their enzymatic origin, they are naturally prone to bind proteins and exhibit bioactivities. Furthermore, their worldwide distribution and ease of accessibility has contributed to promote investigations on their activity. Overall, these characteristics make NPs excellent models for the design of novel therapeutics. This review offers a critical and comprehensive overview of the most promising NPs, isolated from plants, fungi, marine species, and bacteria, endowed with inhibitory properties against traditional and emerging mycobacterial enzymatic targets. A selection of 86 compounds is here discussed, with a special emphasis on their biological activity, structure-activity relationships, and mechanism of action.

34392191,Improved potency of pyridin-2(1H)one derivatives for the treatment of mechanical allodynia.,"['Animal model of chronic pain', 'Inflammatory chronic pain', 'Mechanical allodynia', 'Pyridin-2(1H)-ones', 'p38 MAPK']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"Mechanical allodynia, a painful sensation caused by innocuous touch, is a major chronic pain symptom, which often remains without an effective treatment. There is thus a need for new anti-allodynic treatments based on new drug classes. We recently synthetized new 3,5-disubstituted pyridin-2(1H)-one derivatives. By substituting the pyridinone at the 3-position by various aryl/heteroaryl moieties and at the 5-position by a phenylamino group, we discovered that some derivatives exhibited a strong anti-allodynic potency in rats. Here, we report that varying the substitution of the pyridinone 5-position, the 3-position being substituted by an indol-4-yl moiety, further improves such anti-allodynic potency. Compared with 2, one of the two most active compounds of the first series, eleven out of nineteen newly synthetized compounds showed higher anti-allodynic potency, with two of them completely preventing mechanical allodynia. In the first series, hit compounds 1 and 2 appeared to be inhibitors of p38α MAPK, a protein kinase known to underlie pain hypersensitivity in animal models. Depending on the substitution at the 5-position, some newly synthetized compounds were also stronger p38α MAPK inhibitors. Surprisingly, though, anti-allodynic effects and p38α MAPK inhibitory potencies were not correlated, suggesting that other biological target(s) is/are involved in the analgesic activity in this series. Altogether, these results confirm that 3,5-disubstituted pyridine-2(1H)-one derivatives are of high interest for the development of new treatment of mechanical allodynia.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Its primary function involves RNA regulation. The TDP-43 protein is also involved in many diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and even cancers. These TDP-43 mediated diseases are collectively called as TDP-43 proteinopathies. Intense research in the last decade has increased our understanding on TDP-43 structure and function in biology. The three-dimensional structures of TDP-43 domains such as N-terminal domain (NTD), RNA-recognition motif-1 (RRM1), RNA-recognition motif-2 (RRM2) and the C-terminal domain (CTD) or low-complexity domain (LCD) have been solved. These structures have yielded insights into novel binding sites and pockets at various TDP-43 domains, which can be targeted by designing a diverse library of ligands including small molecules, peptides and oligonucleotides as molecular tools to (i) study TDP-43 function, (ii) develop novel diagnostic agents and (iii) discover disease-modifying therapies to treat TDP-43 proteinopathies. This review provides a summary on recent progress in the development of TDP-43 binding ligands and uses the solved structures of various TDP-43 domains to investigate putative ligand binding regions that can be exploited to discover novel molecular probes to modulate TDP-43 structure and function.",,,,Crown Copyright © 2021.

However, it is difficult to conjugate chemo-drug and molecular probe for combined therapy due to the complex pharmacokinetics of different molecules. Here, a novel anticancer theranostic prodrug (BTMP-SS-PTX) had been designed and synthesized by conjugating paclitaxel (PTX) with 2-(benzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-4-methoxyphenol (BTMP) through a disulphide (-S-S-) linkage, which was redox-sensitive to the high concentration of glutathione in tumors. Upon activation with glutathione in weakly acid media, the BTMP-SS-PTX can be dissociated to release free PTX and visible BTMP, which realized the visual tracking of free drug. The cytotoxicity study demonstrated that soluble prodrug BTMP-SS-PTX displayed more outstanding anticancer activity in HepG2, MCF-7 and HeLa cells, lower toxicity to non-cancer cells (293 T) than free drugs. Furthermore, BTMP-SS-PTX was still able to induce apoptosis of HeLa cells and significantly inhibited tumor growth in HeLa-xenograft mouse model. On the basis of these findings, BTMP-SS-PTX could play a potential role in cancer diagnosis and therapy.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

34388381,Emerging targets in drug discovery against neurodegenerative diseases: Control of synapsis disfunction by the RhoA/ROCK pathway.,"['Dendritic spines', 'Neurodegenerative diseases', 'ROCK inhibitors', 'Rho kinase', 'Synaptic disfunction']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"Synaptic spine morphology is controlled by the activity of Rac1, Cdc42 and RhoA, which need to be finely balanced, and in particular RhoA/ROCK prevents the formation of new protrusions by stabilizing actin formation. These processes are crucial to the maturation process, slowing the de novo generation of new spines. The RhoA/ROCK also influences plasticity processes, and selective modulation by ROCK1 of MLC-dependent actin dynamics leads to neurite retraction, but not to spine retraction. ROCK1 is also responsible for the reduction of the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles. These and other evidences suggest that ROCK1 is the main isoform acting on the presynaptic neuron. On the other hand, ROCK2 seems to have broad effects on LIMK/cofilin-dependent plasticity processes such as cofilin-dependent PSD changes. The RhoA/ROCK pathway is an important factor in several different brain-related pathologies via both downstream and upstream pathways. In the aggregate, these evidences show that the RhoA/ROCK pathway has a central role in the etiopathogenesis of a large group of CNS diseases, which underscores the importance of the pharmacological modulation of RhoA/ROCK as an important pathway to drug discovery in the neurodegenerative disease area. This article aims at providing the first review of the role of compounds acting on the RhoA/ROCK pathway in the control of synaptic disfunction.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Antibacterial activity depends on these oligopeptides having a cationic modification to increase their permeation. Unfortunately, this modification is associated with cytotoxicity, motivating the need for novel approaches. The sulfonimidamide functionality has recently gained much interest in drug design and discovery, as a means of introducing chirality and an imine-handle, thus allowing for the incorporation of additional substituents. This in turn can tune the chemical and biological properties, which are here explored. We show that introducing the sulfonimidamide between the lipophilic tail and the peptide in a series of signal peptidase inhibitors resulted in antibacterial activity, while the sulfonamide isostere and previously known non-cationic analogs were inactive. Additionally, we show that replacing the sulfonamide with a sulfonimidamide resulted in decreased cytotoxicity, and similar results were seen by adding a cationic sidechain to the sulfonimidamide motif. This is the first report of incorporation of the sulfonimidamide functional group into bioactive peptides, more specifically into antibacterial oligopeptides, and evaluation of its biological effects.",,,,Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

The prevalence of drug resistance among bacteria underscores an urgent goal for new antibacterial agents with novel mode of action. Here we first designed and synthesized a class of benzothiazolyl-5-methylphenanthridium derivatives and evaluated their antibacterial activity. On this basis, we further designed and synthesized another class of novel indolyl-5-methylphenanthridium derivatives by optimizing the benzothiazolyl-5-methylphenanthridium core and evaluated their antibacterial activity targeting the bacterial cell division protein FtsZ. The results showed that the indolyl-5-methylphenanthridium derivatives had greatly improved activity against various drug-resistant bacterial strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE). Among them, compound C5 displayed excellent antibacterial activity against susceptible (MIC = 1 μg/mL), methicillin-resistant and clinical isolated S. aureus (MIC = 2 μg/mL). With low hemolytic activity towards mice red blood cells, C5 exhibited good antibacterial effect in vivo in preliminary pharmacodynamic assay. More importantly, C5 was difficult to induce bacterial resistance.

The DNJ and l-ido-DNJ derivatives with C-5 alkyl chains ranging from methyl to dodecyl were assayed against various glycosidases to study the effect of chain length on enzyme inhibition. Glycosidase inhibition study of DNJ derivatives showed potent and selective inhibitions of α-glucosidase; DNJ derivatives with methyl, pentyl to octyl, undecyl and dodecyl as C-5 branched chains showed significantly improved rat intestinal maltase inhibition. In contrast, most 5-C-alkyl-l-ido-DNJ derivatives were weak or moderate inhibitors of the enzymes tested, with only three compounds found to be potent α-glucosidase inhibitors. Docking studies showed different interaction modes of 5-C-ethyl-DNJ and 5-C-octyl-DNJ with ntMGAM and also different binding modes of 5-C-alkyl-DNJ and 5-C-alkyl-l-ido-DNJ derivatives; the importance of the degree of accommodation of the C-5 substituent in the hydrophobic groove and pocket may account for the variation of glycosidase inhibition in the two series of derivatives.

However, the weak potency, low selectivity over FABP3, or poor pharmacokinetic profiles of currently reported dual FABP4/5 inhibitors impeded further research. Here, we described the characterization of a series of dual FABP4/5 inhibitors with improved metabolic stabilities and physicochemical properties based on our previous studies. Among the compounds, D9 and E1 exhibited good inhibitory activities against FABP4/5 and favorable selectivity over FABP3 in vitro. In cell-based assays, D9 and E1 exerted a decrease of FABP4 secretion, a strong anti-lipolytic effect in mature adipocytes, and suppression of MCP-1 expression in THP-1 macrophages. Moreover, D9 and E1 possessed good metabolic stabilities in mouse hepatic microsomes and acceptable pharmacokinetics profiles in ICR mice. Further in vivo experiments showed that D9 and E1 could potently decrease serum FABP4 levels and ameliorate glucose metabolism disorders in obese diabetic db/db mice.

An in-house natural products library of 1407 compounds were screened against neuroinflammation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated microglia cells to identify a novel hit 1,6-O,O-diacetylbritannilactone (OABL) with anti-neuroinflammatory activity. Furthermore, a 1,10-seco-eudesmane sesquiterpenoid library containing 33 compounds was constructed by semisynthesis of a major component 1-O-acetylbritannilactone (ABL) from the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Inula Britannica L. Compound 15 was identified as a promising anti-neuroinflammatory agent by nitrite oxide (NO) production screening. 15 could attenuate tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) productions, and inhibit the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) at a submicromolar level. Mechanistic study revealed that 15 significantly modulated TLR4/NF-kB and p38 MAPK pathways, and upregulated the anti-oxidant response HO-1. Besides, 15 promoted the conversion of the microglia from M1 to M2 phenotype by increasing levels of arginase-1 and IL-10. The structure-activity relationships (SARs) analysis indicated that the α-methylene-γ-lactone motifs, epoxidation of C5=C10 bond and bromination of C14 were important to the activity. Parallel artificial membrane permeation assay (PAMPA) also demonstrated that 15 and OABL can overcome the blood-brain barrier (BBB).

Pyrrolopyrimidines are one group of versatile scaffolds suitable for tailored drug development. However not many precedents of this type of pharmacophore have been investigated in the realm of third generation of covalent EGFR-TKIs. Herein, a series of pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives able to block mutant EGFR activity in a covalent manner were synthesized, through optimized Buchwald-Hartwig C-N cross coupling reactions. Their preliminary bioactivity and corresponding inhibitory mechanistic pathways were investigated at molecular and cellular levels. Several compounds exhibited increased biological activity and enhanced selectivity compared to the control compound. Notably, compound 12i selectively inhibits HCC827 cells harboring the EGFR activating mutation with up to 493-fold increased efficacy compared to in normal HBE cells.

34303871,Current trends in computer aided drug design and a highlight of drugs discovered via computational techniques: A review.,"['Computational studies', 'Computer-aided drug design', 'Software programs', 'Virtual screening']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"Computer-aided drug design (CADD) is one of the pivotal approaches to contemporary pre-clinical drug discovery, and various computational techniques and software programs are typically used in combination, in a bid to achieve the desired outcome. Several approved drugs have been developed with the aid of CADD. On SciFinder®, we evaluated more than 600 publications through systematic searching and refining, using the terms, virtual screening; software methods; computational studies and publication year, in order to obtain data concerning particular aspects of CADD. The primary focus of this review was on the databases screened, virtual screening and/or molecular docking software program used. Furthermore, we evaluated the studies that subsequently performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and we reviewed the software programs applied, the application of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and experimental assays. To represent the latest trends, the most recent data obtained was between 2015 and 2020, consequently the most frequently employed techniques and software programs were recorded. Among these, the ZINC database was the most widely preferred with an average use of 31.2%. Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) was the most prominently used type of virtual screening and it accounted for an average of 57.6%, with AutoDock being the preferred virtual screening/molecular docking program with 41.8% usage. Following the screening process, 38.5% of the studies performed MD simulations to complement the virtual screening and GROMACS with 39.3% usage, was the popular MD software program. Among the computational techniques, DFT was the least applied whereby it only accounts for 0.02% average use. An average of 36.5% of the studies included reports on experimental evaluations following virtual screening. Ultimately, since the inception and application of CADD in pre-clinical drug discovery, more than 70 approved drugs have been discovered, and this number is steadily increasing over time.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

NQO1 substrates show potent anticancer activity through the redox cycle mediated by NQO1, while the NQO1 probes can monitor NQO1 levels in cancers. High sensitivity of probes is needed for diagnostic imaging in clinic. In this study, based on the analysis of NQO1 catalytic pocket, the naphthoquinone trigger group 13 rationally designed by expanding the aromatic plane of the benzoquinone trigger group 10 shows significantly increased sensitivity to NQO1. The sensitivity of the naphthoquinone trigger group-based probe A was eight times higher than that of benzoquinone trigger group-based probe B in vivo.

Despite the strong genetic support and therapeutic potential for a NRF2 transcriptional inhibitor, currently there are no known direct inhibitors of the NRF2 protein or its complexes with MAF and/or DNA. Herein we describe the design of a novel and high-confidence homology model to guide a medicinal chemistry effort that resulted in the discovery of a series of peptides that demonstrate high affinity, selective binding to the Antioxidant Response Element (ARE) DNA and thereby displace NRF2-MAFG from its promoter, which is an inhibitory mechanism that to our knowledge has not been previously described. In addition to their activity in electrophoretic mobility shift (EMSA) and TR-FRET-based assays, we show significant dose-dependent ternary complex disruption of NRF2-MAFG binding to DNA by SPR, as well as cellular target engagement by thermal destabilization of HiBiT-tagged NRF2 in the NCI-H1944 NSCLC cell line upon digitonin permeabilization, and SAR studies leading to improved cellular stability. We report the characterization and unique profile of lead peptide 18, which we believe to be a useful in vitro tool to probe NRF2 biology in cancer cell lines and models, while also serving as an excellent starting point for additional in vivo optimization toward inhibition of NRF2-driven transcription to address a significant unmet medical need in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Currently, there is only one licensed vaccine against Dengue, Dengvaxia®. However, its administration is not recommended for children under nine years. Still, there are no specific inhibitors available to treat these infectious diseases. Among the flaviviral proteins, NS5 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a metalloenzyme essential for viral replication, suggesting that it is a promising macromolecular target since it has no human homolog. Nowadays, several NS5 RdRp inhibitors have been reported, while none inhibitors are currently in clinical development. In this context, this review constitutes a comprehensive work focused on RdRp inhibitors from natural, synthetic, and even repurposing sources. Furthermore, their main aspects associated with the structure-activity relationship (SAR), proposed mechanisms of action, computational studies, and other topics will be discussed in detail.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

This transient persister is an important reason underlying its resistance. There is an urgent need to find new antibacterial agents capable of eradicating methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) persisters. In this study, 37 new derivatives of cajaninstilbene acid (CSA) were designed and synthesized, and their biological activity against MRSA persisters was evaluated. Most of the newly synthesized derivatives exhibit more potent antimicrobial properties against S. aureus and MRSA than CSA itself, and 23 of the 37 derivatives show a tendency to eradicate MRSA persisters. A representative compound (A6) was demonstrated to target bacterial cell membranes. It eradicated the adherent biofilm of MRSA in a concentration dependent manner, and showed a synergistic antibacterial effect with piperacilin. In a model mouse abscess caused by MRSA persisters, A6 effectively reduced the bacterial load in vivo. These results indicate that A6 is a potential candidate for treatment of MRSA persister infections.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Previously we have demonstrated that harmicines, hybrid compounds composed from β-carboline alkaloid harmine and cinnamic acid derivatives, linked via either triazole or amide bond, exert significant antiplasmodial activity. In this paper, we report synthesis, antiplasmodial activity and cytotoxicity of expanded series of novel triazole- and amide-type harmicines. Structure-activity relationship analysis revealed that amide-type harmicines 27, prepared at N-9 of the β-carboline core, exhibit superior potency against both erythrocytic stage of P. falciparum and hepatic stages of P. berghei. Notably, harmicine 27a, m-(trifluoromethyl)cinnamic acid derivative, exhibited the most favourable selectivity index (SI = 1105). Molecular dynamics simulations revealed the ATP binding site of P. falciparum heat shock protein 90 as a druggable binding location, confirmed the usefulness of the harmine's N-9 substitution and identified favourable N-H … π interactions involving Lys45 and the aromatic phenyl unit in the attached cinnamic acid fragment as crucial for the enhanced biological activity. Thus, those compounds were identified as promising and valuable leads for further derivatization in the search of novel, more efficient antiplasmodial agents.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

34256124,Treatment for liver cancer: From sorafenib to natural products.,"['Formation', 'Liver cancer', 'Natural products', 'Structure-activity relationship', 'Therapeutic targets']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"Liver cancer most commonly develops in patients with chronic liver disease, the etiology of which includes viral hepatitis (B and C), alcohol, obesity, dietary carcinogens, and so forth. The current treatment modalities, including surgical resection and liver transplantation, have been found far from effective. Hence, there is an obvious critical need to develop alternative strategies for the treatment of it. In this review, we discuss the formation process and therapeutic targets of liver cancer. Currently, targeted therapy is limited to sorafenib, lenvatinib, regorafenib, ramucirumab and cabozantinib which leads to a survival benefit in patients, but on the other hand is hampered by the occurrence of drug resistance. Pleasingly and importantly, there are multiple natural products undergoing clinical evaluation in liver cancer, such as polyphenols like icaritin, resveratrol, and silybin, saponins including ginsenoside Rg3 and glycyrrhizinate, alkaloid containing irinotecan and berberine and inorganic compound arsenic trioxide at present. Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that these compounds inhibit liver cancer formation owing to the influence on the anti-viral, anti-inflammation, anti-oxidant, anti-angiogenesis and anti-metastasis activity. Furthermore, a series of small molecule derivatives inspired by the aforementioned compounds are designed and synthesized according to structure-activity relationship studies. Drug combination and novel type of drug-targeted delivery system thereof have been well developed. This article is ended by a perspective remark of futuristic development of natural product-based therapeutic regimen for liver cancer treatment. We expect that this review is an account for current status of natural products as promising anti-liver cancer treatments and should contribute to its understanding.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Its dysregulation is associated with a vast number of diseases, of which modifying the tumor microenvironment is one of vital clinical interest. Despite various attempts, there is still no FDA-approved therapy to inhibit the TGFβ pathway. Major mainstream approaches involve impairment of the TGFβ pathway via inhibition of the TGFβRI kinase. With the purpose to identify non-receptor kinase-based inhibitors to impair TGFβ signaling, an in-house chemical library was enriched, through a computational study, to eliminate TGFβRI kinase activity. Selected compounds were screened against a cell line engineered with a firefly luciferase gene under TGFβ-Smad-dependent transcriptional control.

NDM-1 belongs to the class B1 broad-spectrum enzyme of β-lactamase. The two positively charged zinc ions in the active center have electrostatic interaction with the hydroxyl ions in them to seize the hydrogen atom near the water molecule to form a bridging ring water molecule, which strengthens its nucleophilicity and attacks the carbonyl group on the lactam ring; thus, catalyzing the hydrolysis of β-lactam antibiotics. Since NDM-1 has an open active site and unique electrostatic structure, it essentially provides a wider range of substrate specificity. Due to its flexible hydrolysis mechanism and more and more variants also aggravate the threat of drug-resistant bacteria infection, there is still no effective inhibitor in clinic, which is a serious threat to human health and public health safety. The electron-rich substituents of NDM-1 inhibitors coordinate with two positively charged zinc ions in the active center of the enzyme through ion-dipole interaction to produce NDM-1 inhibitory activity. In this review, the research progress of NDM-1 enzyme and its inhibitors in the past 5 years was reviewed.

Thus, the eradication of H. pylori infection is an important way for preventing and managing the gastric diseases. Multiple-therapy with several antibacterial agents is used for the eradication of H. pylori infections; however the increase of resistance to H. pylori strains has resulted in unsatisfactory eradication and unsuccessful treatment. Furthermore, the combination therapy with high dosing leads to the disruption of intestinal microbial flora and undesired side effects. Therefore, the search for new therapeutic agents with high selectivity against H. pylori is a field of current interest. In recent years, diverse compounds originating from natural sources or synthetic drug design programs were evaluated and tried to optimize for applying against H. pylori.

However, a short effective-window limits their therapeutic benefits. Clinical studies have confirmed that the combination of AChE inhibitors and neuroprotective agents exhibits better anti-AD effects. We have previously reported that the dual AChE/GSK3β (Glycogen synthase kinase 3β) modulators have both neuroprotective effects and cognitive impairment-improvement effects. In this study, we characterized a new backbone of the AChE/GSK3β inhibitor 11c. It was identified as a highly potent AChE inhibitor and was found superior to donepezil, the first-line drug for the treatment of AD. In vivo studies confirmed that 11c significantly inhibited the activity of AChE in the brain but had little effect on the activity of AChE in the intestine. This advantage of 11c was expected to reduce the peripheral side effects caused by donepezil. Furthermore, biomarker studies have shown that 11c also improved the levels of acetylcholine and synaptophysin in the brain and exhibited neuroprotective effects.

Camptothecin (CPT), isolated from the bark of Camptotheca acuminata, is a cytotoxic alkaloid that attenuates cancer cell replication by inhibiting DNA topoisomerase 1. Despite its promising and wide spectrum antiproliferative activity, its use is limited due to low solubility, instability, acquired tumour cell resistance, and remarkable toxicity. This has led to the development of numerous CPT analogues with improved pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles. Three natural product-inspired drugs, namely, topotecan, irinotecan, and belotecan, are clinically approved and prescribed drugs for the treatment of several types of cancer, whereas other derivatives are in clinical trials. In this review, which covers literature from 2015 to 2020, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview and describe efforts that led to the development of a variety of CPT analogues.

34175537,Potential pharmacological strategies targeting the Niemann-Pick C1 receptor and Ebola virus glycoprotein interaction.,"['Cholesterol', 'EBOV', 'Ebola virus disease', 'NPC1', 'Niemann-Pick C1', 'Viruses']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) receptor is an intracellular protein located in late endosomes and lysosomes whose main function is to regulate intracellular cholesterol trafficking. Besides being postulated as necessary for the infection of highly pathogenic viruses in which the integrity of cholesterol transport is required, this protein also allows the entry of the Ebola virus (EBOV) into the host cells acting as an intracellular receptor. EBOV glycoprotein (EBOV-GP) interaction with NPC1 at the endosomal membrane triggers the release of the viral material into the host cell, starting the infective cycle. Disruption of the NPC1/EBOV-GP interaction could represent an attractive strategy for the development of drugs aimed at inhibiting viral entry and thus infection. Some of the today available EBOV inhibitors were proposed to interrupt this interaction, but molecular and structural details about their mode of action are still preliminary thus more efforts are needed to properly address these points. Here, we provide a critical discussion of the potential of NPC1 and its interaction with EBOV-GP as a therapeutic target for viral infections.",,,,Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

Indeed, some of them, such as resveratrol (RES), have been examined in clinical trials. Nevertheless, their success has been scarce mainly due to their low bioavailability. In this study, we found serendipitously that O-silyl RES derivatives exerted a better neuroprotective activity than resveratrol itself and decided to explore them as potential drugs for neurodegenerative and neurological diseases. We have also designed and prepared a series of O-silyl RES prodrugs to improve their bioavailability. We found that di-triethylsilyl and di-triisopropylsilyl RES derivatives were better in vitro neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory agents than RES. Among these derivatives and their corresponding acyl-, glycosyl- and carbamoyl-prodrugs, 3,5-triethylsilyl-4'-(6″-octanoylglucopyranosyl) resveratrol 26 showed the best profile on toxicity and neuroprotective activity in zebra fish embryo. Compound 26 was also capable of reducing the loss of motor coordination in a 3-nitropropionic acid mice model of Huntington's disease, in a similar way to RES. However, 26 diminished pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 to a higher extent than RES and improved the latency to fall in the rotarod test by 10% with respect to RES. Finally, we investigated 26 and RES as potential treatments on an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) multiple sclerosis mice model. We observed that, in a therapeutic regimen, 26 significantly diminished the progression of EAE severity and reduced the percentage of animals with moderate to severe clinical score, whereas RES showed no improvement.",,,,Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Despite tremendous advancements in the therapeutic sector and drug development strategies, still the existing anti-leishmanial agents are associated with some clinical issues like drug resistance, toxicity and selectivity. Therefore, several research groups are continuously working towards the development of new therapeutic candidates to overcome these issues. Many potential heterocyclic moieties have been explored for this purpose including triazoles, chalcones, chromone, thiazoles, thiosemicarbazones, indole, quinolines, etc. It is evident from the literature that the majority of anti-leishmanial agents act by interacting with key regulators including PTR-I, DHFR, LdMetAP1, MAPK, 14 α-demethylase and pteridine reductase-I, etc. Also, these tend to induce the production of ROS which causes damage to parasites. In the present compilation, authors have summarized various significant synthetic procedures for anti-leishmanial agents reported in recent years. A brief description of the pharmacological potentials of synthesized compounds along with important aspects related to structural activity relationship has been provided. Important docking outcomes highlighting the possible mode of interaction for the reported compounds have also been included. This review would be helpful to the scientific community to design newer strategies and also to develop novel therapeutic candidates against leishmaniasis.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In a recent SAR investigation involving a subset of GEBR library compounds, we have demonstrated that, depending on length and flexibility, ligands can either adopt a twisted, an extended or a protruding conformation, the latter allowing the ligand to form stabilizing contacts with the regulatory domain of the enzyme. Here, based on those findings, we describe further chemical modifications of the protruding subset of GEBR library inhibitors and their effects on ligand conformation and potency.

But the drawback is the low water solubility which prevents its further development. In this context, we successfully overcame this limitation by synthesizing two novel prodrugs introducing the amino acid sequence D-Ala-Leu-Lys (TP). Moreover, TP sequence has a high affinity with plasmin, a protease recognized as overexpressed in many solid cancers, including HCC and ovarian carcinoma. The prodrugs were synthesized and fully characterized in terms of in vitro ADME properties, plasma stability and plasmin-induced release of the parent drug. The inhibitory activity against Sgk1 was evaluated and in vitro growth inhibition was evaluated on ovarian carcinoma and HCC cell lines in the presence and absence of human plasmin. In vivo pharmacokinetic properties and preliminary tissue distribution confirmed a better profile highlighting the importance of the prodrug approach. Finally, the prodrug antitumor efficacy was evaluated in an HCC xenografted murine model, where a significant reduction (around 90%) in tumor growth was observed. Treatment with ProSi113-TP in combination with paclitaxel in a paclitaxel-resistant ovarian carcinoma xenografted murine model, resulted in an impressive reduction of tumor volume greater than 95%.

34157437,Inhibitors of gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) for the management of hematological malignancies.,"['Cancer', 'Clinical trial', 'Extracellular matrix (ECM)', 'Hematological malignancy', 'Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)', 'Matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor (MMPI)']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) are collectively known as gelatinases whereas MMP-2 is gelatinase-A and MMP-9 is termed as gelatinase-B. Gelatinases and other matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have long been associated with solid tumor invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. However, there is paucity of data available regarding the role of gelatinases in hematological malignancies. Recent studies have shown that gelatinases activities or functions are correlated with hematological malignancies. Strategies for designing more specific gelatinase inhibitors like catalytic (CAT) domain inhibitors and hemopexin (PEX) domain inhibitors as well as signaling pathway based or gelatinase expression inhibitors had been reported against hematologic malignant cells. Several substrate based non-selective to non-substrate based relatively selective synthetic matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors (MMPIs) had been developed. Few MMPIs had reached in clinical trials during the period of 1990s-2000s. Unfortunately the anti-tumor and anti-metastatic efficacies of these MMPIs were not justified with patients having several advanced stage solid tumor cancers in any substantial number of clinical trials. Till date not a single MMPI passed phase III clinical trials designed for advanced metastatic cancers due to adverse events as well as lack of ability to show uniformity in disease prolongation. With the best of our knowledge no clinical trial study has been reported with small molecule synthetic inhibitors against hematological malignancies. This review looks at the outcome of clinical trials of MMPIs for advanced stage solid tumors. This can therefore, act as a learning experience for future development of successful gelatinase inhibitors for the management of hematological malignancies.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Our previous work has shown that metal-binding small molecules can effectively inhibit pUL89-C while conferring significant antiviral activities. In this report we generated a collection of 43 metal-binding small molecules by repurposing analogs of the 6-arylthio-3-hydroxypyrimidine-2,4-dione chemotype previously synthesized for targeting HIV-1 RNase H, and by chemically synthesizing new N-1 analogs. The analogs were subjected to two parallel screening assays: the pUL89-C biochemical assay and the HCMV antiviral assay. Compounds with significant inhibition from each assay were further tested in a dose-response fashion. Single dose cell viability and PAMPA cell permeability were also conducted and considered in selecting compounds for the dose-response antiviral testing. These assays identified a few analogs displaying low μM inhibition against pUL89-C in the biochemical assay and HCMV replication in the antiviral assay. The target engagement was further evaluated via a thermal shift assay using recombinant pUL89-C and molecular docking. Overall, our current work identified novel inhibitors of pUL89-C with significant antiviral activities and further supports targeting pUL89-C with metal-binding small molecules as an antiviral approach against HCMV.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

They play a central role in many physiological and cellular processes. With the advances in protein crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and computational power over the past couple of decades, the carbohydrate-receptor interactions are now well understood and characterized. Nevertheless, designing efficient carbohydrate inhibitors is a laborious endeavour. They are known to have weak affinities, unsuitable pharmacokinetic properties and highly cumbersome/complex synthetic routes. To circumvent these issues many non-carbohydrate strategies have been reported. Galectins are a sub-family of lectin proteins which have been recognized as crucial targets for a wide variety of diseases. Many candidates targeting galectins are currently in advanced stages of clinical trials. There have been a few reports of non-carbohydrate inhibitors targeting galectins which comprise of peptide-based inhibitors and a recent flourish of heterocyclic inhibitors. In this review, we have briefly highlighted the strategies like fragment-based drug-design and high-throughput screens utilized to identify non-carbohydrate based antagonists for proteins wherein the presence of a sugar was believed to be essential. Additionally, we have described the literature pertaining to non-carbohydrate inhibitors of galectins and how previous reports on rational substitution of a sugar motif could aid in design of heterocyclics that inhibit lectins/galectins. We have concluded with remarks on challenges, gap in our understanding and future perspectives concerned with rational design of non-carbohydrate molecules targeting lectins/galectins.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The phototherapeutic effects of complex 2 have been evaluated using low doses of blue light irradiation. Complex 2 exerted promising photoactivity against pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria strains of clinical interest, displaying a phototoxic index (PI) of 15 for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, one of the major microorganisms predominating lung infections. Likewise, the anticancer activity of 2 was also increased upon light irradiation in human lung A549 cancer cells (PI = 36).

Bioactivity screening showed that hybrid 5i, which was modified with methoxybenzene, exerted a significant inhibitory activity against MRSA (MIC = 0.004 mM), which was 6 times better than the anti-MRSA activity of the reference drug norfloxacin (MIC = 0.025 mM). Compound 5i neither conferred apparent resistance onto MRSA strains even after multiple passages nor triggered evident toxicity to human hepatocyte LO2 cells and normal mammalian cells (RAW 264.7). Molecular docking showed that highly active molecule 5i might bind to DNA gyrase by forming stable hydrogen bonds. In addition, molecular electrostatic potential surfaces were developed to explain the high antibacterial activity of the target compounds. Furthermore, preliminary mechanism studies suggested that hybrid 5i could disrupt the bacterial membrane of MRSA and insert itself into MRSA DNA to impede its replication, thus possibly becoming a potential antibacterial repressor against MRSA.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

As a result, multidrug resistance has emerged as a serious threat to human health. Many organic compounds commonly used as drugs in the past, no longer have pure organic mode of action rather need bio-transformation or more activation. Bulk of research has shown that they need trace amount of metal ions incorporated within the chemistry of bioactive molecules for enhancement of their potentiality to fight aggressively against resistance. The deficiency of some metal ions can also be responsible for many diseases like growth retardation, pernicious anemia and heart diseases in infants. To overcome these problems, there is a need to introduce novel strategies which have new mechanism of action along with significant spectrum of biological activity, enhanced safety and efficacy. Bioinorganic compounds have played imperative role in developing the new strategy in the form of ""Metal Based Drugs"". In current years there have been momentous rise of interest in the application of metal based Schiff base compounds to treat various diseases which are difficult to be treated with conventional methodologies. The unique properties of metal chelates acting as an intermediate between conventional organic and inorganic compounds provided innovative opportunities in the field of pharmaceutical chemistry. In this review, we have exclusively focused on the search of metal based 1,2,4-triazole derived Schiff base compounds (synthesized, reported and reviewed in the past ten years) that possess various biological activities such as antifungal, antibacterial, antioxidant, antidiabetic, anthelmintic, anticancer, antiproliferative, cytotoxic and DNA-intercalation activity.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

These compounds, called microtubule targeting agents (MTAs), cause a mitotic arrest during G2/M phase, subsequently inducing cell apoptosis. MTAs could be classified in two groups: microtubule stabilising agents (MSAs) and microtubule destabilising agents (MDAs). In this paper we present a new series of (E) (Z)-2-(5,6-difluoro-(1H)2H-benzo[d] [1,2,3]triazol-1(2)-yl)-3-(R)acrylonitrile (9a-j, 10e, 11a,b) and (E)-2-(1H-benzo[d] [1,2,3]triazol-1-yl)-3-(R)acrylonitrile derivatives (13d,j), which were recognised to act as MTAs agents. They were rationally designed, synthesised, characterised and subjected to different biological assessments. Computational docking was carried out in order to investigate the potential binding to the colchicine-binding site on tubulin. From this first prediction, the di-fluoro substitution seemed to be beneficial for the binding affinity with tubulin. The new fluorine derivatives, here presented, showed an improved antiproliferative activity when compared to the previously reported compounds. The biological evaluation included a preliminary antiproliferative screening on NCI60 cancer cells panel (1-10 μM). Compound 9a was selected as lead compound of the new series of derivatives. The in vitro XTT assay, flow cytometry analysis and immunostaining performed on HeLa cells treated with 9a showed a considerable antiproliferative effect, (IC50 = 3.2 μM), an increased number of cells in G2/M-phase, followed by an enhancement in cell division defects. Moreover, β-tubulin staining confirmed 9a as a MDA triggering tubulin disassembly, whereas colchicine-9a competition assay suggested that compound 9a compete with colchicine for the binding site on tubulin. Then, the co-administration of compound 9a and an extrusion pump inhibitor (EPI) was investigated: the association resulted beneficial for the antiproliferative activity and compound 9a showed to be client of extrusion pumps. Finally, structural superimposition of different colchicine binding site inhibitors (CBIs) in clinical trial and our MDA, provided an additional confirmation of the targeting to the predicted binding site. Physicochemical, pharmacokinetic and druglikeness predictions were also conducted and all the newly synthesised derivatives showed to be drug-like molecules.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, the translational potential of HPLW is limited by its low metabolic stability, which would shorten the in vivo efficacy of the molecule. Here, we developed a peptide analog of HPLW, named HPLW2, that retains the structural and biological properties of the original peptide but features an impressive resistance to degradation by human serum proteases. HPLW2 was obtained by covalently modifying the chemical structure of the peptide with molecular tools known to impart protease resistance. Notably, the peptide was cyclized by installing an interstrand triazole bridge through Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction. HPLW2 appears as a novel and promising drug candidate with potential biomedical application in the proangiogenic therapy as a low molecular weight drug, alternative to the use of VEGF.

Amphipathic and natural daptomycin is biocompatible antibacterial polypeptide used in clinical practice. Herein, doxorubicin (DOX) was stabilized by zwitterionic daptomycin (Dap) micelles in aqueous solution to form a zwitterionic nanodrug (Dap-DOX micelles). The hydrodynamic size and zeta potential of Dap-DOX micelles were 85 nm and -10 mV, respectively. The study on the controlled release showed that more DOX molecules were released from Dap-DOX micelles at acidic condition of tumor tissue than that at neutral condition of normal tissue which was due to pH responsiveness of Dap-DOX micelles. Dap-DOX micelles exhibited good stability in fibrinogen solution. Moreover, MTT studies showed that Dap-DOX micelles had higher cytotoxicity than free DOX. Notably, the results of flow cytometry indicated that the average fluorescence intensity of Dap-DOX micelle-treated cells was higher than that of free DOX-treated cells, and acidic conditions were more favorable for Dap-DOX micelles than normal pH in cell uptake assay. More importantly, Dap-DOX micelles were biocompatible in vivo based on the changes of weight and blood indexes of mice. Dap-DOX micelles were selectively accumulated at tumor sites in vivo through EPR effect, which reduced the toxicity of free DOX and achieved excellent tumor inhibition effect.

N-acetylgalactosamine with α configuration (Tn) was synthesized and used as the active targeting ligand. Notably, Tn modified nanoliposomes loaded with PTX (Tn-Lipo-PTX) showed a narrow distribution (PDI = 0.18-0.20) with 74 ± 0.36 nm of average sizes. Tn-Lipo-PTX has a high encapsulation efficiency of more than 93.0% and 13% of drug loading (DL). Compared with no targeted Con-Lipo-PTX, Tn-Lipo-PTX showed lower and sustained release characteristic in PBS in vitro. Tn targeting ASGPR was confirmed by HepG-2 cells uptake experiment by fluorescence microscopy analysis. Tn-Lipo-PTX accumulated in HepG-2 cells and this process was inhibited by adding Tn ligand, supporting receptor-mediated endocytosis mechanism. MTT assays was implemented in four cell lines.

However, to overcome the severe side effects of current PPARγ-targeted drugs, novel PPARγ ligands need to be developed. Sulindac, an identified ligand of PPARγ, is widely used in clinic as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. To explore its potential application for diabetes, we designed and synthesized a series of sulindac derivatives to investigate their structure-activity relationship as PPARγ ligand and potential anti-diabetic effect. We found that meta-substitution in sulindac's benzylidene moiety was beneficial to PPARγ binding and transactivation. Z rather than E configuration of the benzylidene double bond endowed derivatives with the selectivity of PPARγ activation. The indene fluorine is essential for binding and regulating PPARγ. Compared with rosiglitazone, compound 6b with benzyloxyl meta-substitution and Z benzylidene double bond weakly induced adipogenesis and PPARγ-targeted gene expression. However, 6b potently improved glucose tolerance in a diabetic mice model. Unlike rosiglitazone, 6b was devoid of apparent toxicity to osteoblastic formation. Thus, we provided some useful guidelines for PPARγ-based optimization of sulindac and an anti-diabetic lead compound with less side effects.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Currently, the widespread occurrence of resistance toward Mtb strains is becoming a significant concern to public health. This scenario exaggerated the need for the discovery of novel targets and their inhibitors. Targeting the ""Mtb cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis"" is an attractive strategy to overcome drug resistance. Mur enzymes (MurA-MurF) play essential roles in the peptidoglycan synthesis by catalyzing the ligation of key amino acid residues to the stem peptide. These enzymes are unique and confined to the eubacteria and are absent in humans, representing potential targets for anti-tubercular drug discovery. Mtb Mur ligases with the same catalytic mechanism share conserved amino acid regions and structural features that can conceivably exploit for the designing of the inhibitors, which can simultaneously target more than one isoforms (MurC-MurF) of the enzyme. In light of these findings in the current review, we have discussed the recent advances in medicinal chemistry of Mtb Mur enzymes (MurA-MurF) and their inhibitors, offering attractive multi-targeted strategies to combat the problem of drug-resistant in M. tuberculosis.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Monomeric Aβ is derived from amyloid precursor protein, whereupon it aggregates into various assemblies, including oligomers and fibrils, which disrupt neuronal membrane integrity and induce cellular damage. Aβ is directly neurotoxic/synaptotoxic, but may also induce neuroinflammation through the concomitant activation of microglia. Previously, we have shown that furosemide is a known anthranilate-based drug with the capacity to downregulate the proinflammatory microglial M1 phenotype and upregulate the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. To further explore the pharmacologic effects of furosemide, this study reports a series of furosemide analogs that target both Aβ aggregation and neuroinflammation, thereby addressing the combined proteopathic-immunopathic pathogenesis of AD. Forty compounds were synthesized and evaluated.

34116328,Synthesis and biological evaluation of chalcone-polyamine conjugates as novel vectorized agents in colorectal and prostate cancer chemotherapy.,"['Anti-proliferative activity', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell cycle arrest', 'Chalcone polyamine conjugates', 'Colorectal and prostate cancer', 'Polyamine-vectorized anticancer drugs']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"The aim of this study was to synthesize chalcone-polyamine conjugates in order to enhance bioavailability and selectivity of chalcone core towards cancer cells, using polyamine-based vectors. Indeed, it is well-known that polyamine transport system is upregulated in tumor cells. 3',4,4',5'-tetramethoxychalcone was selected as parent chalcone since it was found to be an efficient anti-proliferative agent on various cancer cells. A series of five chalcone-polyamine conjugates was obtained using the 4-bromopropyloxy-3',4',5'-trimethoxychalcone as a key intermediate. Chalcone core and polyamine tails were fused through an amine bond. These conjugates were found to possess a marked in vitro antiproliferative effect against colorectal (HT-29 and HCT-116) and prostate cancer (PC-3 and DU-145) cell lines. The most active conjugate (compound 8b) was then chosen for further biological evaluations to elucidate mechanisms responsible for its antiproliferative activity. Investigations on cell cycle distribution revealed that this conjugate can prevent the proliferation of human colorectal and prostate cancer cells by blocking the cell cycle at the G1 and G2 phase, respectively. Flow cytometry analysis revealed a sub-G1 peak, characteristic of apoptotic cell population and our inquiries highlighted apoptosis induction at early and later stages through several pro-apoptotic markers. Therefore, this chalcone-N1-spermidine conjugate could be considered as a promising agent for colon and prostatic cancer adjuvant therapy.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The anti-mycobacterial drug clofazimine is an efficient inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling in TNBC, reducing tumor cell proliferation in vitro and in animal models. These properties make clofazimine a candidate to become first targeted therapy against TNBC. In this work, we optimized the clofazimine structure to enhance its water solubility and potency as a Wnt inhibitor. After extensive structure-activity relationships investigations, the riminophenazine 5-(4-(chlorophenyl)-3-((2-(piperazin-1-yl)ethyl)imino)-N-(pyridin-3-yl)-3,5-dihydrophenazin-2-amine (MU17) was identified as the new lead compound for the riminophenazine-based targeted therapy against TNBC and Wnt-dependent cancers. Compared to clofazimine, the water-soluble MU17 displayed a 7-fold improved potency against Wnt signaling in TNBC cells resulting in on-target suppression of tumor growth in a patient-derived mouse model of TNBC. Moreover, allowing the administration of reduced yet effective dosages, MU17 displayed no adverse effects, most notably no clofazimine-related skin coloration.",,,,Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

Anticancer drug discovery directed at histone epigenetic modulators has gained impressive advances with six drugs available for cancer therapy and numerous other candidates undergoing clinical trials. However, limited therapeutic profile, drug resistance, narrow safety margin, and dose-limiting toxicities pose intractable challenges for their clinical utility. Because histone epigenetic modulators undergo intricate crosstalk and act cooperatively to shape an aberrant epigenetic profile, co-targeting histone epigenetic modulators with a different mechanism of action has rapidly emerged as an attractive strategy to overcome the limitations faced by the single-target epigenetic inhibitors.

There have been considerable research interests in using nanomaterials to the prementioned methods. Among all nanomaterials, dendritic materials with three-dimensional structures, host-guest properties, and nano-polymeric dimensions have received considerable attention. Amine-terminated dendritic structures including, polyamidoamine (PAMAM), polypropyleneimine (PPI), and polyethyleneimine (PEI), have been enormously utilized in bio-modification. This review briefly described the structure of these three common dendritic polymers and their use to modify diagnostic and therapeutic agents in six major applications, including drug delivery, gene delivery, biosensor, bioimaging, tissue engineering, and antimicrobial activity.

34087496,Discovery of novel purinylthiazolylethanone derivatives as anti-Candida albicans agents through possible multifaceted mechanisms.,"['Antifungal', 'Drug resistance', 'Purine', 'Thiazole']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"An unprecedented amount of fungal and fungal-like infections has recently brought about some of the most severe die-offs and extinctions due to fungal drug resistance. Aimed to alleviate the situation, new effort was made to develop novel purinylthiazolylethanone derivatives, which were expected to combat the fungal drug resistance. Some prepared purinylthiazolylethanone derivatives possessed satisfactory inhibitory action towards the tested fungi, among which compound 8c gave a MIC value of 1 μg/mL against C. albicans. The active molecule 8c was able to kill C. albicans with undetectable resistance as well as low hematotoxicity and cytotoxicity. Furthermore, it could hinder the growth of C. albicans biofilm, thus avoiding the occurrence of drug resistance. Mechanism research manifested that purinylthiazolylethanone derivative 8c led to damage of cell wall and membrane disruption, so protein leakage and the cytoplasmic membrane depolarization were observed. On this account, the activity of fungal lactate dehydrogenase was reduced and metabolism was impeded. Meanwhile, the increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) disordered redox equilibrium, giving rise to oxidative damage to fungal cells and fungicidal effect.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In particular, the various chemical modifications of the side chains in this scaffold have yielded the compounds potent for the wild type tumor cells, their counterparts with molecular determinants of altered drug response, as well as in vivo settings. Further exploring the chemotype of anticancer heteroarene-fused anthraquinones, we herein demonstrate that derivative of anthra[2,3-b]thiophene-2-carboxamide, (compound 8) is highly potent against a panel of human tumor cell lines and their drug resistant variants. Treatment with submicromolar or low micromolar concentrations of 8 for only 30 min was sufficient to trigger lethal damage of K562 chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. Compound 8 (2.5 μM, 3-6 h) induced an apoptotic cell death as determined by concomitant activation of caspases 3 and 9, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, increase of Annexin V/propidium iodide double stained cells, DNA fragmentation (subG1 fraction) and a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential. Neither a significant interaction with double stranded DNA nor strong inhibition of the DNA dependent enzyme topoisomerase 1 by 8 were detectable in cell free systems. Laser scanning confocal microscopy revealed that some amount of 8 was detectable in mitochondria as early as 5 min after the addition to the cells; exposure for 1 h caused significant morphological changes and clustering of mitochondria. The bioisosteric analog 2 in which the thiophene ring was replaced with furan was less active although the patterns of cytotoxicity of both derivatives were similar. These results point at the specific role of the sulfur atom in the antitumor properties of carboxamide derivatives of heteroarene-fused anthraquinone.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Employment of ACT is associated with problems such as 'Artemisinin Resistance' and the 'Hypnozoite conundrum' that hinder the complete eradication of malaria. In this view, the natural products specifically comprising β-carboline scaffold have shown good antiplasmodial responses against different strains of malaria. Taking these observations forward, researchers have performed structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies around three different β-carboline skeletons (tetrahydro β-carbolines, dihydro β-carbolines, β-carbolines) to design new β-carboline derived heterocyclic structures or modified naturally occurring derivatives. In addition, different approaches such as dimerization and linkage to other moieties have also been adopted to enhance the antimalarial activity.

Within the numerous quinolines developed as antiproliferative agents, this review is focused on compounds interfering with DNA structure or with proteins/enzymes involved in the regulation of double helix functional processes. In this light, a special focus is given to the quinoline compounds, acting with classical/well-known mechanisms of action (DNA intercalators or Topoisomerase inhibitors). In particular, the quinoline drugs amsacrine and camptothecin (CPT) have been studied as key lead compounds for the development of new agents with improved PK and tolerability properties. Moreover, notable attention has been paid to the quinoline molecules, which are able to interfere with emerging targets involved in cancer progression, as G-quadruplexes or the epigenetic ones (e.g.: histone deacetylase, DNA and histones methyltransferase). The antiproliferative and the enzymatic inhibition data of the reviewed compounds have been analyzed.

All five approved SSRIs possess either fluorine or chlorine atoms, and there is a limited number of reports describing their analogs with heavier halogens, i.e., bromine and iodine. To elucidate the role of halogen atoms in the binding of SSRIs to SERT, we designed a series of 22 fluoxetine and fluvoxamine analogs substituted with fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine atoms, differently arranged on the phenyl ring. The obtained biological activity data, supported by a thorough in silico binding mode analysis, allowed the identification of two partners for halogen bond interactions: the backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms of E493 and T497. Additionally, compounds with heavier halogen atoms were found to bind with the SERT via a distinctly different binding mode, a result not presented elsewhere. The subsequent analysis of the prepared XSAR sets showed that E493 and T497 participated in the largest number of formed halogen bonds.

34022717,Emerging trends of receptor-mediated tumor targeting peptides: A review with perspective from molecular imaging modalities.,"['Anticancer peptides', 'Chemotherapeutics', 'Natural peptides', 'Optical molecular imaging', 'SPECT/PET']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"Natural peptides extracted from natural components such are known to have a relatively short in-vivo half-life and can readily metabolize by endo- and exo-peptidases. Fortunately, synthetic peptides can be easily manipulated to increase in-vivo stability, membrane permeability and target specificity with some well-known natural families. Many natural as well as synthetic peptides target to their endogenous receptors for diagnosis and therapeutic applications. In order to detect these peptides externally, they must be modified with radionuclides compatible with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET). Although, these techniques mainly rely on physiological changes and have profound diagnostic strength over anatomical modalities such as MRI and CT. However, both SPECT and PET observed to possess lack of anatomical reference frame which is a key weakness of these techniques, and unfortunately, cannot be available freely in most clinical centres especially in under-developing countries. Hence, it is need of the time to design and develop economic, patient friendly and versatile strategies to grapple with existing problems without any hazardous side effects. Optical molecular imaging (OMI) has emerged as a novel technique in field of medical science using fluorescent probes as imaging modality and has ability to couple with organic drugs, small molecules, chemotherapeutics, DNA, RNA, anticancer peptide and protein without adding chelators as necessary for radionuclides. Furthermore, this review focuses on difference in imaging modalities and provides ample knowledge about reliable, economic and patient friendly optical imaging technique rather radionuclide-based imaging techniques.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) such as Tamoxifen represents the clinical standard of care (SoC). Despite the therapeutic importance of current SoC agents, 30-50% of prolonged treatment patients inevitably generated resistant tumor cells, usually eventually suffered tumor relapse and developed into metastatic breast cancer (MBC), which was the leading cause of female cancer-related mortality. Among these, most resistant tumors remained dependent on ERα signaling, which reignited the need for the next generation of ERα related agents. We hypothesized that selective estrogen receptor covalent antagonists targeting ERα would provide a therapeutic alternative. In the current work, series of novel benzothiophene hybrids bearing electrophile moieties were synthesized and biologically evaluated. The representative analogue 15c exhibited potent anti-proliferative effect in MCF-7 cell lines in vitro, and further mechanism studies confirmed the necessity of covalent bonding.

34000483,Structure-based discovery of potent and selective small-molecule inhibitors targeting signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3).,"['Privileged structures', 'STAT3', 'Small-molecule inhibitors', 'Structure-based drug discovery']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"STAT3 has been validated as an attractive anticancer target due to its important roles in cancer initiation and progression. However, discovery of potent and selective STAT3 small-molecule inhibitors with druglike properties is still challenging. In this study, two series of substituted 2-phenylquinolines and 2-arylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridines were designed through structure-based drug discovery approach by condensing the privileged structures of STX-119 and SH4-54. Our study has resulted in the discovery of a number of highly potent and selective STAT3 inhibitors, exemplified by compound 39 with the privileged structure of 2-phenylimidazo[1,2-a]pyridine, which selectively inhibits phosphorylation of STAT3 and suppresses subsequent signaling pathway. Moreover, 39 inhibits cell growth, migration and invasion of human triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells lines. Consistently, it achieves significant and dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition in both cell line-derived and patient-derived xenograft tumor models in mice. These results clearly indicate that 39 is a highly potent and selective STAT3 inhibitor.",,,,Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The EGFR signaling pathway is considered as a significant approach in targeted therapy of cancers. Blocking the EGFR-driven pathway by inhibiting the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR have shown considerable improvement in cancer therapy. In an effort to identify EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), several small molecules especially pyrimidine containing derivatives have been designed by applying molecular simulation and evaluated the emergence of epigenetic mutation and resistance problems restricted the long-term effectiveness of such medication and explained the need for further investigations in this field. In recent years, the studies have been focused on genetic alterations on EGFR tyrosine kinase domain, which led to the design and synthesis of more selective and effective inhibitors. Herein, we give an overview of the importance and status of EGFR inhibitors in cancer therapy.

33992930,Natural products and analogs as preventive agents for metabolic syndrome via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors: An overview.,"['Hepatic steatosis', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Natural products', 'PPAR', 'Synthesis', 'Type 2 diabetes']",European journal of medicinal chemistry,"Natural products and synthetic analogs have drawn much attention as potential therapeutical drugs to treat metabolic syndrome. We reviewed the underlying mechanisms of 32 natural products and analogs with potential pharmacological effects in vitro, and especially in rodent models and/or patients, that usually act on the PPAR pathway, along with other molecular targets. Recent outstanding total syntheses or semisyntheses of these lead compounds are stated. In general, they can activate the transcriptional activity of PPARα, PPARγ, PPARα/γ, PPARβ/δ, PPARα/δ, PPARγ/δ and panPPAR as weak, partial agonists or selective PPARγ modulators (SPPARγM), which may be useful for managing obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2D), dyslipidemia and non-fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Terpenoids is the largest group of compounds that act as potential modulators on PPARs and are comprised from small lipophilic cannabinoids to lipophilic pentacyclic triterpenes and polar saponins. Shikimates-phenylpropanoids include polar heterocyclic flavonoids and phenolic compounds containing at least one C3-C6 unit and usually a double bond on the propyl chain. Quercetin (19), resveratrol (24) and curcumin (27), stand out from this group for exhibiting beneficial effects on patients. Alkaloids, the minor group of potential modulators on PPARs, include berberine (30), which has been widely explored in preclinical and clinical studies for its potential beneficial effects on T2D and dyslipidemia.
